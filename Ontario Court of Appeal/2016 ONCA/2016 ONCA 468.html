  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peel Educational &amp; Tutorial Services Limited carrying on business as
    Mississauga Private School (the “School”) is an accredited <span lang=EN-US>private
    school, offering classes from pre-kindergarten to grade 12.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The School employed Remy Fernandes (“Mr. Fernandes” or the “respondent”)
    as a teacher from January 1999 until April 2009, when his employment was
    terminated, without notice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fernandes sued the School and Gabrielle Bush, a co-owner of the
    School, alleging that he had been wrongfully dismissed. The School defended on
    the basis that there was just cause for dismissal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Mr. Fernandes had committed acts of misconduct,
    including the creation of false marks and inaccurate grades and then lying to
    cover up the improprieties. Nonetheless, he found that the School had
    wrongfully dismissed Mr. Fernandes.  He also found that Mr. Fernandes became
    disabled during the reasonable notice period. He dismissed the claim as against
    Ms. Bush.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By judgment dated November 12, 2014, (“Judgment #1”) the School was
    ordered to pay Mr. Fernandes damages for wrongful dismissal amounting to one
    year’s salary, a small miscellaneous income loss claim, and loss of long-term disability
    benefits. A second judgment, dated June 18, 2015 (“Judgment #2”), quantified
    the value of the long-term disability benefits. A third judgment, dated August
    13, 2015 (“Judgment #3”), required the School to pay Mr. Fernandes costs of $130,000,
    inclusive of HST and disbursements. No costs were ordered for or against Ms.
    Bush.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The School appeals. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal and dismiss the action. In my view, Mr.
    Fernandes’ misconduct cannot be reconciled with his obligations as a teacher. It
    was fundamentally and directly inconsistent with Mr. Fernandes’ obligations to
    the School and to his students. Considered in context, that misconduct was
    sufficiently serious that it justified dismissal without notice. Accordingly, the
    trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Fernandes had been wrongfully dismissed. </p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND </p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span lang=EN-US>The School’s Grading Policy</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The School is accredited by the Ministry of
    Education to grant credits towards obtaining an Ontario Secondary School
    Diploma. In order to maintain its private school accreditation, the School must
    follow the Ministry's policies, including those concerning the assessment and
    evaluation of student progress and achievement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The School established guidelines for the
    assessment and evaluation of student achievement, based on the provincial
    curriculum expectations and the achievement levels set by the Ministry. One of
    the School’s policies stipulated that no zeroes or blanks could appear on a
    report card, except in the case of plagiarism. The School required teachers to
    hand in their grades in “hard copy” and on time, so that they could be used to
    prepare student report cards.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Each school year, the School issued four report
    cards: in November, late January or early February, April and June. The first
    three report cards were interim; the fourth was the final report card. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>All report cards were compiled by the homeroom
    teacher. The interim report cards included spreadsheets and progress reports. They
    were then attached to a letter along with a form so that parents could request
    interviews.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The fourth and final report cards were prepared
    after final exams. The final report cards had a longer comment section and a
    more detailed marking record. Only the final grades from the June report cards appeared
    on a student's official Ontario Student Record.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span lang=EN-US> January 1999</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Fernandes began teaching for the School in
    January 1999. He taught computer studies for the junior, intermediate and
    senior school classes. He also worked for the School in the summer months,
    doing information technology work. Like other teachers at the School, Mr.
    Fernandes was involved in extracurricular activities, including as a volleyball
    coach and being involved in the Arts and Music Night. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Until 2008, Mr. Fernandes received positive assessments
    for his teaching. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><i><span lang=EN-US>The 2008
    Assessment </span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Paul Edwards was the School’s vice-principal in
    2008. He completed Mr. Fernandes’ annual assessment for the 2007/08 school year
    (the “2008 assessment”). The 2008 assessment was on the standardized,
    comprehensive four-page assessment form that covered curriculum (planning,
    preparation and instruction), classroom management and appearance,
    communication, and professionalism.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the 2008 assessment, the School expressed disappointment
    with Mr. Fernandes’ performance in a number of areas.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the curriculum category, there were three
    critical comments. The first related to the video retrospective shown at the
    School Gala. The comment was that although the video seemed to involve
    considerable class time and student involvement, it was very disappointing and
    not representative of the School’s history or of the imaginative potential of
    the students. Another comment was that the grade 12 yearbook course was “very
    problematic, with deadlines being missed badly and the administration not being
    informed of issues until it was almost too late”. A third comment relating to
    curriculum was that while Mr. Fernandes was passionate about the courses he
    wished to teach, he took on new courses only with “real reluctance”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In terms of classroom management and appearance,
    the 2008 assessment noted that:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Fernandes was inflexible in his application
    of school policy; </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He was sometimes perceived as being inconsistent
    or unfair to the extent that students lost their respect for him; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Too many students had expressed frustration and
    resentment about their treatment by Mr. Fernandes, saying that they did not
    feel they had been treated fairly but, rather, “picked on” and arbitrarily
    disciplined; and </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Too often, relatively minor infractions had been
    the basis for sending students to the vice-principal’s office when they should
    have been resolved by the teacher.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The 2008 assessment was otherwise positive. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Fernandes was not happy with his 2008 assessment
    and provided a two-page response to it. In his response, Mr. Fernandes explained
    why he disagreed with the comments noted above and concluded with the
    following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I have every reason to be disappointed with my
    professionalism and performance, as I see the administration is not pleased,
    and have concerns that are not becoming of a good teacher.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I shall strive to always do my best, and
    always work in the best interest of the students and the [S]chool. Having said
    this, I shall go out of my way to make sure [the School] excels and grows both
    as an educational institution and as a business in general. </span></p>

    principal, and Drew Cleland became co-owners of the School through a

    as head coach of the volleyball team, Mr. Fernandes was made the assistant
    coach. Consequently, Mr. Fernandes was no longer able to get the hours he
    needed to obtain a coaching certificate that he had been working towards. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Fernandes felt that his “demotion” to assistant
    coach had been done to thwart his wish to become further certified.  The trial
    judge found no evidence to support this contention.      </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span lang=EN-US>March 2009 – A meeting between Mssrs.

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In early March 2009, Mr. Fernandes complained to
    Ms. Bush about Mr. Edwards. Mr. Fernandes believed that since Mr. Edwards’
    promotion to principal, Mr. Edwards had begun bullying Mr. Fernandes and had
    given Mr. Fernandes an unmanageable workload.  Ms. Bush suggested that he speak
    directly with Mr. Edwards.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 10, Mr. Fernandes spoke to Mr. Edwards
    and asked what he could do to improve their relationship. Mr. Edwards suggested
    that they meet the following day to discuss the matter.</span></p>

    gave Mr. Fernandes a memo which responded to his request for suggestions on how
    he might improve. The trial judge found that the memo was “constructive and
    civil”. Among other things, the memo echoed some of the same concerns that had
    been expressed in the May 2008 assessment.     </span></p>

    to discuss the grades that had been submitted by five teachers, one of whom was
    Mr. Fernandes. In respect of Mr. Fernandes’ grades, they were concerned about the
    alarming number of blanks that were recorded. If a student failed to complete an
    assignment or test and a blank was registered to reflect that, the computer
    would transform the blank into a grade of zero. Because of the large numbers of
    blanks in the grades that Mr. Fernandes had submitted, the grades for his classes
    were exceptionally low. There were also calculation errors in the grades that he
    had submitted.</span></p>

    March break. Mr. Edwards gave Ms. Bush the document that he had prepared, at
    her request, about the problems with Mr. Fernandes’ grades (the “March 30
    Report”). The March 30 Report referred to Mr. Fernandes’ initial March 3rd
    grades and those that he resubmitted on March 13th and set out a number of
    problems that both sets of grades displayed. In both sets of grades there were two
    types of problems: zeroes had been left for individual students who had not
    completed assignments and/or presentations, contrary to the School’s grading policy;
    and, there were inconsistencies/inaccuracies in how the grades had been calculated. </span></p>

    to see that the grades were virtually perfect. This made them suspicious,
    particularly as the marks for the respondent's students had gone from being the
    worst of all of those of the staff at the School to the best.  The grades
    indicated that all student assignments and presentations had been completed and
    marked.  Ms. Bush was struck by the grades of one student with significant
    educational issues whom she had been monitoring. That student had been given a
    perfect score (5/5), despite having not completed all of her work in the

    to investigate the validity of the marks that Mr. Fernandes had given to his

    agreed and accepted the termination. Ms. Bush said that Mr. Fernandes was

    17, the same day that Mr. Fernandes was terminated.  They included the student grades
    that Mr. Fernandes had submitted. Ms. Bush testified that although those grades
    were not a true reflection of the students’ progress at that time, there was insufficient
    time to rectify them. Mr. Edwards and Ms. Bush knew that the School had a big
    task ahead of it in terms of re-evaluating and re-assessing all of the work of
    all of the students in all of Mr. Fernandes’ classes. While Ms. Bush was

lang=EN-US>Dr. Sahheed and Dr. Joshi. Dr. Sahheed was Mr. Fernandes’ family
    physician. Dr. Joshi was his treating psychiatrist. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Sahheed testified that Mr. Fernandes had major depression arising
    from his loss of employment.  In his opinion, Mr. Fernandes was not able to
    return to work as a teacher or anywhere else. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Joshi testified that Mr. Fernandes had major depressive disorder,
    mixed with anxiety, panic attacks and posttraumatic stress disorder. In his
    view, the major cause of Mr. Fernandes’ medical difficulties was the termination
    of his employment as a teacher. Other causes were his financial stress, the
    fact that he had to sell his home, and his feelings of shame, guilt and
    worthlessness because he was not working. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fernandes also called Matthew Williamson, the regional manager of

    employed by Great-West Life for 13 years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Williamson testified that he reviewed Mr. Fernandes’ application for
    disability benefits and denied the claim by letter on April 21, 2014. He
    determined that Mr. Fernandes was ineligible for benefits because Mr. Fernandes
    was not employed on the date of disability. However, he testified that he had
    also reviewed the medical information submitted by Mr. Fernandes’ physicians
    and concluded Mr. Fernandes did not qualify for disability benefits, even if he
    were employed.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Mr. Williamson’s letter explained, “disability is assessed on the
    basis of the duties a person regularly performed for the employer before the
    disability started.” A person is considered disabled under the policy “if,
    because of disease or injury, there is no combination of duties [the person]
    can perform that regularly took at least 60% of [his or her] time at work to
    complete.” According to the letter, the medical information provided to the
    insurer by counsel for Mr. Fernandes was insufficient to support the level of
    functional impairment that he was claiming.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The School also led the evidence of Robert Semone, an alumnus. Mr.
    Semone had been a student of Mr. Fernandes several years before his dismissal
    and testified that, even though he believed he had failed an examination in Mr.
    Fernandes’ class by submitting only two lines of code for the whole
    examination, he received a 72 on the examination and a 74 in the course. Mr.
    Semone had never spoken to anyone about this incident until shortly before the
    trial, when Ms. Bush approached him. He agreed that his memory was hazy and he
    was unsure about certain details. </p>

    more than 10 years and said that up until the spring of 2009, Mr. Fernandes was

    termination. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge stated that although the School found out in April 2009
    that Mr. Fernandes had created incorrect marks, those marks were still produced
    to the students and parents without comment on their accuracy. He said that
    because the School knowingly sent out the false marks, those marks “were not as
    serious to either the [S]chool or the students as the defendants would submit.
    If this were such an egregious failing on the part of Mr. Fernandes, the marks
    would not have been released.”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge stated that after balancing the various considerations,
    termination was not the appropriate sanction for the misconduct. In his view,
    the School could have fashioned a reprimand and given a warning that such
    conduct, if repeated, would lead to summary dismissal. He said that the “rather
    abrupt change” in Mr. Fernandes’ professional behaviour should have led the
    School to make more of an effort at enquiry to assist Mr. Fernandes rather than
    terminate his employment without proper notice.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He concluded that Mr. Fernandes had been wrongfully dismissed because

    denied Mr. Fernandes’ claim not only because it was made after termination but
    also because it did not include medical documentation on his cognitive functioning
    or his functions in his activities of daily living. He rejected the School’s
    submission that without that type of evidence, he could not find Mr. Fernandes
    disabled within the meaning of the insurance policy.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was critical of the School for failing to provide Mr.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>ISSUES #1 and #2         Did the trial judge make

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In issues #1 and #2, the School takes exception to a number of the trial
    judge’s findings. It says that certain of those findings are incompatible with
    his determination that Mr. Fernandes’ evidence had to be treated with great
    caution and/or his rejection of Mr. Fernandes’ allegation that beginning in
    September 2008 the Administration was engaged in a malicious conspiracy to have
    him removed from the school. (In respect of the latter, the trial judge said
    that there was nothing in the evidence that could support such a theory.) </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The School also points to the trial judge’s statement that he would
    prefer Mr. Zero’s evidence over that of interested witnesses. It says the trial
    judge then preferred Mr. Fernandes’ evidence over that of Mr. Zero on certain
    events without explanation.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other complaints
    relate to the trial judge’s finding that Mr. Fernandes was disabled within the
    meaning of the School’s insurance policy. The School says that the trial judge
    failed to consider Mr. Williamson’s evidence on this matter and also failed to
    consider the meaning of “disability” within the insurance policy. While the
    School acknowledges that the policy was not before the court, it says that the
    trial judge should have referred to the definition of “disability” in the
    policy which was contained in Mr. Williamson’s letter to the respondent. It
    also takes exception to the way in which the trial judge treated the evidence
    of Dr. Sahheed and Dr. Joshi.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I explain in
    my analysis of Issue #3, the trial judge erred in his application of the
    relevant legal principles when determining whether Mr. Fernandes’ conduct was
    just cause for dismissal. A correct application leads to the conclusion that
    the School had just cause to dismiss Mr. Fernandes. Accordingly, it is
    unnecessary to deal with the many alleged factual errors raised in the first
    two grounds of appeal.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the

lang=EN-US>The governing legal principles can be found at paras. 48-49 of <i>McKinley</i>.
    Justice Iacobucci, writing for the court, states that whether an employer is
    justified in dismissing an employee on the grounds of misconduct is a question
    that requires an assessment of the context of the alleged misconduct. More specifically,
    the test is whether the employee’s misconduct gave rise to a breakdown in the
    employment relationship. He notes that the test can be expressed in different
    ways: just cause for dismissal exists where the misconduct violates an
    essential condition of the employment contract, breaches the faith inherent to
    the work relationship, or is fundamentally or directly inconsistent with the
    employee’s obligations to his or her employer.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>assigning both incorrect and false marks for individual students’

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    trial judge failed to then go on and assess the seriousness of the misconduct. 
    His only discussion of seriousness related to the incorrect grades that Mr.
    Fernandes had provided.  The trial judge said that because the School sent out
    the April interim report cards, knowing of the irregularities of Mr. Fernandes’
    grades and without comment as to their accuracy, Mr. Fernandes’ conduct in

    influence over their students as a result of their positions. The conduct of a
    teacher bears directly upon the community’s perception of the ability of the
    teacher to fulfil such a position of trust and influence, and upon the
    community’s confidence in the public school system as a whole. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of a
    teacher’s most important professional obligations is to fairly and properly
    evaluate and assess student progress and achievement. The School trusted Mr.
    Fernandes to fulfill his professional duties as a teacher, including those
    relating to the assessment of his students. So, too, did his students and their
    families. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fernandes’
    misconduct went far beyond mere negligence or incompetence.  Failing to
    properly assign marks and evaluate student progress; falsifying students’
    grades; repeatedly lying to his employer – these intentional acts constitute
    serious misconduct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>2. The Surrounding
    Circumstances</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this step,
    the court must consider the particular circumstances of both the employee and
    the employer. In relation to the employee, the court should consider such
    factors as his or her age, employment history, seniority, role and
    responsibilities. In relation to the employer, the court should consider such
    things as the type of business or activity in which the employer is engaged,
    any relevant employer policies or practices, the employee’s position within the
    organization, and the degree of trust reposed in the employee: <i>Dowling</i>,
    at para. 52.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Employee’s Circumstances</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In relation to Mr.
    Fernandes’ circumstances, the trial judge considered his age and employment
    history.  He noted that Mr. Fernandes <span style='line-height:200%'>had been
    employed with the School for more than 10 years and that until the spring of
    2009, Mr. Fernandes was a well-regarded teacher.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> 
    At other places in his reasons, the trial judge observed that until at least the
    spring of 2008, Mr. Fernandes had been a dedicated and loyal teacher and was
    committed to extracurricular activities in addition to his teaching
    responsibilities.</span> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    trial judge failed to consider one significant matter:  Mr. Fernandes offered
    no explanation for his misconduct. In the meetings during the week of April
    13-17, Mr. Fernandes said there was nothing going on in his life that was
    troubling him or distracting him from fulfilling his teaching responsibilities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The absence of
    any explanation for the misconduct is underscored by two of the trial judge’s other
    findings. First, Mr. Fernandes became ill only after his employment was
    terminated. This finding was based on Mr. Fernandes’ testimony that his medical
    problems started on April 17, 2009, and that prior to that time, his only
    medical difficulty was with diabetes. Second, the trial judge found that “for
    whatever reason”, by the spring of 2009, it was obvious that Mr. Fernandes was nearing
    the end of his abilities as a school teacher. From this, I understand that
    there was no reason discernible to the trial judge to help explain or
    understand the misconduct. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span
style='font-weight:normal'>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> The Employer’s Circumstances</span><i> </i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial
    judge considered the employee’s circumstances, he failed to consider those of
    the employer.  This, too, constitutes legal error. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The School was a
    private school whose accreditation from the Ministry depended upon it meeting
    its obligations in respect of granting credits towards earning an Ontario
    Secondary School Diploma. If the School did not comply with the requisite
    assessment and evaluation standards, it could have lost its right to grant such
    credit. Had that taken place, it is self-evident that the School would have
    suffered serious harm. The respondent’s misconduct exposed the School to that
    potential harm, harm of which the respondent acknowledged he was aware.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that
    the School did not actually suffer that harm is not the point. It is the severity
    of the potential harm that must be considered when assessing the seriousness of
    the misconduct: <i>Lepire v. National Bank of Canada</i>, 2004 FC 155, 267
    F.T.R. 138.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, <span
lang=EN-US>the terms of his contract of employment required Mr. Fernandes to
    &quot;carry out his duties in a professional manner that is compatible with the
    philosophy of the school.&quot;  Mr. Fernandes’ misconduct in terms of his
    failure to fairly assess and evaluate his students in accordance with the
    School’s policies amounted to a breach of that term.     </span><span
lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally, as has
    already been mentioned, the School reposed a large degree of trust in Mr.
    Fernandes to fairly and correctly assign marks and grades to his students.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>3. Was Dismissal Warranted?</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this step of
    the analysis, the court must consider the nature, extent and seriousness of the
    misconduct (step one) in the context of the surrounding circumstances (step
    two) to decide whether there was just cause for dismissal.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons
    already given, a consideration of the full range of misconduct leads to the
    conclusion that it was very serious.  That misconduct – particularly, the
    intentional disregard for the fair and accurate grading of his students – was
    incompatible with Mr. Fernandes’ professional obligations as a teacher and with
    the essential conditions of his employment obligations.  No explanation was
    offered for the misconduct. None is evident on an examination of the record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The misconduct
    put into jeopardy the School’s continued operation as an accredited private
    school and destroyed the trust that the School reposed in Mr. Fernandes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As <i>McKinley </i>stresses,
    the misconduct must be considered in context.  It consisted of acts over a
    period of approximately 2 months, by an employee who had served the School for
    just over ten years.  The duration of the misconduct was short, when compared
    to the overall period of employment.  Nonetheless, in my view, it struck at the
    very heart of the employment relationship, thereby giving rise to its breakdown. 
    Consequently, there was just cause for Mr. Fernandes’ dismissal.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would conclude
    simply by noting that, on the findings of the trial judge, Mr. Fernandes’
    employment was terminated for cause before he became disabled. Therefore, he is
    not eligible for long-term disability payments.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE #4    Did the trial judge err
    in his costs award?</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The School seeks
    leave to appeal the costs award contained in Judgment #3. It argues that the
    trial judge erred because he included costs on a substantial indemnity basis for
    the School’s abandoned counterclaim and substantial indemnity costs should be
    reserved for rare cases of reprehensible conduct.  The SchooI maintains that
    its counterclaim was legitimately conceived and that it was withdrawn for
    practical reasons. Therefore, the School says, its actions did not amount to
    reprehensible conduct and substantial indemnity costs were not properly ordered
    in respect of the defence to the counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the
    core issue before the trial judge was whether Mr.&nbsp;Fernandes’ misconduct
    was sufficiently serious that it struck at the heart of the employment
    relationship. This was a ten-day trial. The trial judge had the advantage of
    hearing evidence from the persons involved. He was in a better position than an
    appellate court to assess the misconduct in the context of a ten-year, mostly
    satisfactory employment relationship. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not
    persuaded that the trial judge failed to consider the seriousness of the
    misconduct or the extent to which it impacted the employment relationship. He
    cited the appropriate governing authority, <i>McKinley v. BC Tel</i>, 2001 SCC
    38, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 161.<i> </i>He also explicitly considered the seriousness
    of the misconduct, at paras. 179-81 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Over six weeks between March 1 and the middle of April, Mr.
    Fernandes created marks that, when the administration found out that they were
    wrong, were still produced by the administration to students and parents
    without comment on their accuracy. The fact that the school knowingly sent out
    the false marks confirms that these interim marks were not as serious to either
    the school or the students as the defendants would submit. If this were such an
    egregious failing on the part of Mr&nbsp;Fernandes, the marks would not have
    been released.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although the defendants referred to this as “academic fraud”,
    that is a very dramatic way of describing a few students who were marked on
    presentations that they had not yet given. That presentation was only one part
    of one course and the presentation made up only one part of the overall mark.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>And finally, although belatedly, Mr Fernandes admitted his
    conduct to the administration.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    determined that immediate termination was not the appropriate sanction for Mr.
    Fernandes’ misconduct and that the appellant could have made more of an effort
    to inquire into the reason for the change in Mr.&nbsp;Fernandes’ professional
    behaviour and to assist him. The appellant also could have fashioned a
    reprimand short of dismissing him without notice. In the trial judge’s words,
    “the punishment outweigh[ed] the seriousness of the infraction.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the
    analysis of Turnbull J.A., dissenting in <em>Henry v. Foxco Ltd.</em>, 2004
    NBCA 22, 269 N.B.R. (2d) 63, at paras. 17-22, 27-33, that the assessment of
    whether misconduct is sufficiently serious as to merit termination without
    notice is a question of fact, to which an appellate court owes deference. He
    cited <em>McKinley</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> in
    which Iacobucci J. noted,<em><span style='font-style:normal'> at para. 49</span></em>,
    “assessing the seriousness of the misconduct requires the facts established at
    trial to be carefully considered and balanced. As such, it is a factual inquiry
    for the jury to undertake.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turnbull J.A.
    concluded, at para. 22:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Thus, absent a palpable and overriding error, there is no basis
    for appellate interference with the trial judge's factual conclusions.
    Moreover, an appellate court must not substitute its opinion for that of the
    trial judge, unless the latter's opinion is unreasonable, that is, “nothing [in
    the trial record] could have justified the judge's conclusion.” See&nbsp;<em>Gallant
    v. Thibodeau&nbsp;</em>(1998), 206 N.B.R. (2d) 336 (C.A.)&nbsp;at paras. 12-16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject
    the appellant’s submissions challenging the trial judge’s findings of fact and
    credibility. They are, in substance, an invitation to this court to retry the
    case. The factual findings made by the trial judge were reasonably open to him
    on the evidence. They were detailed and carefully made. I see no palpable and
    overriding error in his factual findings or conclusions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn next to a
    consideration of the relief granted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    does not challenge the trial judge’s assessment of the 12-month notice period.
    Instead, it submits that the trial judge erred in awarding the respondent the
    disability benefits to which he would have been entitled but for the
    termination without notice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of
    the respondent’s medical problems was, according to the trial judge,
    “essentially unchallenged”: para. 204. Mr. Fernandes’ family physician, Dr.
    Sahheed, testified that Mr. Fernandes had major depression, that he had not
    improved since the events of 2009, and that he was not able to return to work
    as a teacher or to work anywhere else. Dr. Sahheed’s opinion was that the cause
    of Mr. Fernandes’ medical difficulties was the workplace environment and what
    had occurred there.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fernandes’
    treating psychiatrist, Dr. Joshi, also testified. In his opinion, Mr. Fernandes
    had major depressive disorder, along with anxiety neurosis, panic attacks, and
    posttraumatic stress disorder. Dr. Joshi was also of the view that the major
    cause of Mr. Fernandes’ difficulties was the termination of his employment, and
    that he would not be able to return to work in the future.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    did not lead any contrary medical evidence. Instead, it argued that the trial
    judge could not find Mr. Fernandes disabled within the meaning of the insurance
    policy without further medical evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Williamson,
    a regional manager working for the appellant’s insurer, testified that the
    primary reason he denied Mr. Fernandes’ application for disability benefits was
    because the respondent applied after he was already terminated and outside the
    notice period. He also testified that he denied the application because after
    reviewing the medical information submitted by Mr.&nbsp;Fernandes’ physicians,
    he concluded there was not enough medical evidence of the respondent’s
    functional impairment for him to qualify for disability benefits. Mr.
    Williamson summarized the terms of the insurance policy in the letter he wrote
    to Mr. Fernandes’ counsel, dated April 21, 2014, in which he denied the
    respondent’s claim for benefits:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Definition of Disability</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>During the initial assessment period shown in the Table of
    Benefits, disability is assessed on the basis of the duties of a person
    regularly performed for the employer before disability started. He is
    considered disabled if, because of disease or injury, there is no combination
    of duties you can perform that regularly took at least 60% of your time at work
    to complete. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>If disease or
    injury prevents a person from performing a duty, it will also be considered to
    prevent him from performing</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1) Others that are performed only in
    order to complete that duty, and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2) Others that can only be performed
    after that duty is complete.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, given
    the uncontradicted evidence that the respondent was entirely incapable of work,
    there is no palpable and overriding error tainting the trial judge’s conclusion
    that the respondent was, in fact, disabled within the meaning of the policy. In
    response to questions from the trial judge, Mr.&nbsp;Williamson agreed that,
    leaving aside any issues related to the timing of Mr.&nbsp;Fernandes’ application
    for disability benefits, if there was adequate medical evidence demonstrating,
    on a balance of probabilities, that Mr. Fernandes was unable to work, the
    benefits could be approved. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the
    trial judge found that but for the appellant’s wrongful termination without
    notice, Mr.&nbsp;Fernandes would have been eligible to claim disability
    benefits for a period of time even after his termination and that he would have
    applied in time. Again, I see no error in this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I would
    not interfere with the trial judge’s award of substantial indemnity costs on
    the counterclaim. The appellant maintained the counterclaim for five years,
    only withdrawing it without notice at the commencement of trial. The trial
    judge observed that the counterclaim did not appear to have much validity, and
    that the appellant had not defended it to any great extent in its cost
    submissions. The trial judge therefore concluded that the appellant should bear
    the costs of its conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There being no
    palpable and overriding error identified, in my view, the appeal must be
    dismissed. </p>
