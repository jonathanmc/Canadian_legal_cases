  <p class=Judge>Cronk J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>I.        Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  For almost 220 years, the Law Society of Upper Canada has governed the
    legal profession in the public interest under statutory authority granted to it
    by the legislature of Ontario.  For close to a century, in the exercise of its
    statutory mandate, the Law Society has formed a body of rules governing the
    professional conduct and ethical obligations of lawyers, both inside and
    outside the courtroom.  Lawyers who fail to meet the standards of practice
    established by these rules are subject to the Law Society’s complaints and discipline
    processes.  In Ontario, as elsewhere in Canada, it is a privilege to practise
    law, not a right.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Law Society’s rules seek to ensure that the public of Ontario is provided
    with competent and professional legal services.  The competency and
    professionalism of lawyers is the bedrock on which self-regulation of the legal
    profession rests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Law Society’s rules require, as a condition of the privilege of
    practising law, that lawyers’ conduct be characterized by courtesy, civility
    and good faith in dealing with the courts and all participants in the justice
    system, including fellow lawyers.  For advocates, they also affirm counsel’s duty
    to resolutely and honourably advance the client’s cause, without fear of
    professional jeopardy.  These twin duties lay at the core of our adversarial
    system of justice and the advocate’s professional and ethical
    responsibilities.  They are also a mainstay of public confidence in the administration
    of justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>appeal<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>brings<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>the<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>interplay<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>between<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>these<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>foundational<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>duties<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>into sharp focus.<span style='letter-spacing:1.2pt'> It raises </span>important
    issues about the requirements for professionalism in the conduct of litigation,
    the test for establishing professional misconduct for uncivil behaviour, and the
    roles of the Law Society and the courts in addressing an advocate’s uncivil
    conduct in court towards opposing counsel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trigger for these inquiries is the appellant Joseph Peter Paul
    Groia’s challenge to the Law Society Appeal Panel’s findings of professional
    misconduct against him in relation to his in-court conduct towards opposing
    counsel, together with the associated penalty and adverse costs award imposed
    by the Appeal Panel in light of those findings.  The Divisional Court upheld
    the Appeal Panel’s decisions and costs award.  Mr. Groia now appeals to this
    court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.  The Appeal
    Panel’s formulation of the test for incivility in this case was reasonable.  So,
    too, was its conclusion that Mr. Groia engaged in professional misconduct and
    its determination of an appropriate sanction for that misconduct, including its
    costs award.  I also see no basis on which to interfere with the Divisional
    Court’s discretionary costs ruling.    </p>
  <p class=Heading>II.       Legislative and Regulatory Framework in Brief </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Law Society was founded in 1797<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> as the first regulator of the legal profession anywhere in Canada.  Its
    authority to regulate the legal profession is currently governed by the <em>Law
    Society Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8 (the “Act”), and it licenses and regulates
    all barristers and solicitors in Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 4.1 of the Act establishes the Law Society’s functions.  They
    include the obligation to ensure that all persons who practise law or provide
    legal services in Ontario “meet standards of learning, professional competence
    and professional conduct that are appropriate for the legal services they
    provide”: s.&nbsp;4.1(a).  In carrying out its statutory responsibilities, the Law
    Society is required to maintain and advance the cause of justice and the rule
    of law (s. 4.2.1) and to protect the public interest (s. 4.2.3).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Every barrister and solicitor licensed to practise law in Ontario is an
    officer of the court: s. 29 of the Act. Further, by operation of s. 33, every advocate
    practising law in Ontario is prohibited from engaging in professional
    misconduct or conduct unbecoming a licensee.  The Law Society has the
    discretion pursuant to s. 49.3 to investigate a licensee’s conduct if it
    receives information suggesting that the licensee may have breached s. 33.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Law Society is authorized to make rules of practice and procedure
    regarding proceedings before its disciplinary Hearing and Appeal Panels: s.
    61.2(1) of the Act.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> 
    It is empowered to make by-laws providing for additional powers, duties and
    functions of these tribunals, and for a code of professional conduct and ethics:
    ss. 62(0.1).10 and 62(0.1).46.  The Appeal Panel is authorized to hear appeals
    from a final decision or order, or any costs order, made by a Hearing Panel: O.
    Reg. 167/07, s. 5. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The term “professional misconduct” is not defined under the Act. 
    However, the Law Society’s various conduct rules have defined the term and set
    out the requirements for professional conduct by lawyers, together with
    extensive commentaries regarding those requirements.  Relevant to this case are
    two different iterations of the Law Society’s conduct rules: the Law Society’s <em>Professional
    Conduct Handbook, 1998, 2nd ed. </em>(the “1998 Handbook”) (effective January
    30, 1987 to October 31, 2000) and its <em>Rules of Professional Conduct</em> introduced in 2000 (the “2000 Rules”) (collectively, the “Conduct Rules”).<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2000 Rules require that lawyers, when acting as advocates, must
    “represent the client resolutely and honourably within the limits of the law
    while treating the tribunal with candour, fairness, courtesy, and respect” (r.
    4.01(1)).  Further, lawyers must be “courteous, civil, and act in good faith to
    the tribunal and with all persons with whom the lawyer has dealings in the
    course of litigation” (r. 4.01(6)).  Rule 6.03(1) sets out an identical
    requirement for all persons with whom the lawyer has dealings in the course of
    his or her practice.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> 
    The Conduct Rules relevant to the issues on appeal are set out in Schedule “A”
    to these reasons.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These requirements mirror those set out in rr. 5.1-5 and 7.2-1 of the <em>Model
    Code of Professional Conduct</em> developed by the Federation of Law Societies
    of Canada in 2009 and the 2001 <em>Principles of Civility for Advocates</em> and
    the 2009  <em>Principles of Professionalism for Advocates</em> published by the
    Advocates’ Society (the “<em>Principles</em>”).  They reflect the collective
    wisdom of the leadership of the bar in Canada that the practice of law be
    characterized by professionalism, including, specifically, by the core
    attributes of courtesy, civility and good faith. </p>
  <p class=Heading>III.       History of Proceedings </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia is a barrister and solicitor licensed by the Law Society to
    practise law in Ontario.  An experienced securities litigation counsel, he defended
    John Bernard Felderhof, a senior officer and director of Bre-X Minerals Ltd.,
    on eight charges of violating the <em>Securities Act</em>,<i> </i>R.S.O. 1990,
    c. S.5 brought in 1999 by the Ontario Securities Commission (the “OSC”).  The
    charges arose out of the collapse of Bre-X as a result of fraudulent claims
    that it had discovered lucrative gold deposits in Borneo.  Following a lengthy
    trial, Mr. Felderhof was acquitted of all charges.  In November 2009, after the
    trial had concluded, the Law Society initiated disciplinary proceedings against
    Mr. Groia alleging that he had engaged in professional misconduct during his
    defence of Mr. Felderhof.  </p>
  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OSC Prosecution and Felderhof Trial</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To say that the OSC prosecution against Mr. Felderhof was complex,
    protracted and exceptionally acrimonious significantly understates the
    time-consuming, stressful and confrontational climate that rapidly infected the
    proceeding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Almost from the outset, disputes between counsel arose concerning the OSC
    prosecutors’ compliance with their disclosure obligations under <em>R. v.
    Stinchcombe</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326</span></em> and the propriety of their approach to the case, leading to multiple disclosure
    applications before the trial judge and the postponement of the original March 20,
    2000 trial date.  The escalation of these disputes produced a barrage of
    allegations by Mr. Groia of serious prosecutorial misconduct by the OSC
    prosecutors.  These allegations, which the OSC prosecutors vigorously denied,
    precipitated numerous motions and submissions before the trial judge and
    consumed many days of court time.  The nature and gravity of these allegations
    is a central issue on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first phase of the trial began on October 16, 2000 before Hryn J. of
    the Ontario Court of Justice and lasted 70 days.  As the events during these 70
    days were the focus of the Law Society disciplinary proceedings, it is helpful
    to set them out in brief: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Days<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>1-16</span><span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>–<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>The
    defence challenged the constitutionality of s. 122 of the <em>Securities Act</em> and moved to stay the prosecution on the ground that the OSC prosecutors had
    breached their <em>Stinchcombe</em> disclosure obligations.  On day 11, Mr.
    Groia conceded that the defence could not meet the high test for a stay.  The
    trial judge denied the stay motion and made a general order for the OSC to
    comply with its disclosure obligations;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Days 16-25</span> – Counsel made opening
    statements.  The prosecution’s opening lasted eight days, while Mr. Groia
    opened for the defence over two days;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Days  26-38</span> – The first stage of
    the examination-in-chief of the OSC’s first witness, Rolando Francisco;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Days  39-42</span> – Disputes about
    evidence started to dominate the trial. Counsel presented lengthy submissions
    regarding an OSC motion to admit extensive contested documentary evidence on an
    omnibus basis; </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Days<span style='letter-spacing:-1.6pt'> </span>43-52</span> – Mr. Francisco’s direct examination continued;</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>Days<span style='letter-spacing:-1.0pt'> </span>52-65</span> – Mr. Francisco’s cross-examination started. During the cross-examination,
    numerous heated and acrimonious disputes arose about the admissibility of
    documents. In total, Mr. Francisco was examined-in-chief for 20 trial days and
    cross-examined for 10 days.  On day 65, before his cross-examination concluded,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After 70 days of trial, the evidence of the first OSC witness had yet to
    be completed.  The proceeding was frequently interrupted by protracted disputes
    about the admissibility of documents.  By day 70, the toxic nature of the
    dealings between Mr. Groia and the OSC prosecutors was sufficiently pervasive
    as to overtake the orderly and normal progress of the trial.  So much so, that,
    on April 17, 2001, the OSC applied for judicial review in the Superior Court of
    Justice, seeking orders prohibiting the continuation of the trial before the
    trial judge, quashing rulings he had made, and directing that the trial begin
    anew before a different Ontario Court judge (the “JR Application”).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC argued that the trial judge had made several serious errors that
    deprived him of jurisdiction and undermined the OSC’s right to a fair trial. 
    Of particular relevance to this appeal, the OSC maintained that Mr. Groia had
    engaged repeatedly in uncivil conduct in violation of the Conduct Rules and
    that, by failing to control this unacceptable conduct, the trial judge had lost
    jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By judgment dated October 31, 2002, the application judge, Archie G.
    Campbell J., dismissed the JR Application and remitted the matter back to the
    trial judge for the continuation of the trial: <em>R. v. Felderhof</em>, [2002]
    O.T.C. 829 (S.C.J.).  He held that the trial judge had not lost jurisdiction,
    that there had been “a degree of excess on each side” and that “neither side in
    this case has any monopoly over incivility or rhetorical excess”: at paras. 257,
    261 and 264.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OSC appealed to this court.  Mr. Felderhof cross-appealed on the
    issue of costs.  For unanimous reasons written by Rosenberg J.A., this court
    dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal, concluding that Mr. Groia’s impugned
    conduct had not impaired trial fairness or prevented the OSC from presenting
    its case and that, as a result, the trial judge had not lost jurisdiction to
    proceed with the trial: <em>R. v. Felderhof</em> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 481 (“<em>Felderhof</em>”).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their reasons, both the application judge and this court commented on
    Mr. Groia’s conduct during the trial.  The application judge found that, on
    numerous occasions during the trial, Mr. Groia’s conduct had been “improper”,
    “appallingly unrestrained”, “unprofessional”, “inappropriate” and “extreme”. 
    In his costs reasons, he held that Mr. Groia’s conduct justified the bringing
    of the JR Application and that to award Mr. Felderhof his costs would “carry
    the wrong message by rewarding [Mr. Groia] for the consequences of his
    unacceptable conduct”:<em> R. v. Felderhof</em>, 2003 CanLII 41569 (Ont. S.C.J.),
    at para. 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court agreed, describing Mr. Groia’s conduct as improper,
    inappropriate and misconceived in law in many instances.  The court held that
    Mr. Groia was not entitled to advance his allegations of prosecutorial
    misconduct unless and until he was prepared to bring a motion for abuse of
    process.  Mr. Groia’s failure to bring a formal motion, instead purporting to
    put the prosecution repeatedly on notice of what he said the defence intended
    to eventually argue, “prolonged the proceedings and provided a further platform
    for [his] excessive and often ill-considered remarks”: <em>Felderhof</em>, at
    para. 76.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second phase of the trial began on March 30, 2004 before the same
    trial judge, but with different prosecutors.  It concluded on July 31, 2007,
    without further incident, with the acquittal of Mr. Felderhof on all charges: <em>R.
    v. Felderhof</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2007 ONCJ 345</span></em>. 
    By the end, the trial had consumed 160 days of court hearing time, spanning almost
    seven years, including the time devoted to the JR Application and the related appeal
    to this court.</p>

    its own initiative<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> against Mr. Groia under the Act. In doing so, it relied in significant part on
    Campbell J.’s comments about Mr. Groia in his reasons on the JR Application and
    those of this court in <em>Felderhof</em> (collectively, the “Reviewing Courts’
    Reasons”).  At no time did the trial judge or the OSC prosecutors complain to
    the Law Society about Mr. Groia’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The particulars of Mr. Groia’s alleged misconduct, as set out in the Law
    Society’s Notice of Application, focused on events during the 70 days leading
    up to the JR Application – the first phase of the trial.  The Law Society
    asserted that Mr. Groia had engaged in multiple acts of professional misconduct
    in his dealings both with the court and the OSC prosecutors during the trial.  In
    summary, the Law Society alleged that Mr. Groia:<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)   failed to treat the court with courtesy and respect
    because of his consistent pattern of rude, improper or disruptive conduct;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)   failed to act in good faith, and failed to conduct himself
    in a fair, courteous, respectful and civil manner to the court; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)   undermined the integrity of the profession by

    abusive, offensive, or otherwise inconsistent with the proper tone of a
    professional communication from a lawyer, contrary to the Conduct Rules; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4)      failed to act with courtesy and good faith through

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The proceeding before the Hearing Panel took place over 19 days between
    August 2011 and April 2012.  Mr. Groia testified and called seven other
    witnesses, most of whom had been involved in the OSC prosecution or Bre-X-generated
    civil litigation.  The Law Society called no witnesses, instead relying on the
    Reviewing Courts’ Reasons to establish that Mr. Groia’s alleged conduct
    constituted professional misconduct.  The Hearing Panel held that it would
    amount to an abuse of process to re-litigate the findings of the Reviewing
    Courts.  It ruled that, while it was not bound by the Reviewing Courts’
    Reasons, they were admissible before it and could be considered as evidence of
    misconduct by Mr. Groia.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hearing Panel found that Mr. Groia’s attacks on the OSC prosecutors were
    unjustified and constituted conduct falling below the standards of civility,
    courtesy and good faith required under the Conduct Rules.  It also held that
    Mr. Groia’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct were “wrong in law” and
    that the positions he took on documents were “not well-founded in the law of
    evidence or in accord with usual practices in large document cases” (at para.
    190).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in the Hearing Panel’s view, Mr. Groia did not act in good
    faith in advancing his allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.  Rather, he was
    motivated “to disrupt the orderly proceeding of the trial by provoking the
    prosecution and creating the conditions for the trial to collapse under its own
    weight” (at para. 135).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hearing Panel concluded that the Law Society had proven all its professional
    misconduct allegations against Mr. Groia: <em>Law Society of Upper Canada v.
    Groia</em>, 2012 ONLSHP 0094.  It imposed a penalty of two months’ suspension
    of his licence to practise law and a reprimand. It also awarded costs of the discipline
    hearing to the Law Society in the amount of $246,960.53, plus interest: <em>Law
    Society of Upper Canada v. Groia</em>, 2013 ONLSHP 0059.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appeal Panel Decisions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia appealed to the Appeal Panel. The Appeal Panel allowed his appeal
    in part. It affirmed the Hearing Panel’s findings of professional misconduct relating
    to Mr. Groia’s dealings with the OSC prosecutors (the “Conduct Decision”). 
    However, it varied the length of his licence suspension from two months to one
    month (the “Penalty Decision”):  <em>Law Society of Upper Canada v. Groia</em>,
    2013 ONLSAP 0041.  It also reduced the Law Society’s costs award from
    $246,960.53 to $200,000: <em>Law Society of Upper Canada v. Groia</em>, 2014
    ONLSTA 0011.  It awarded no costs of the appeal hearing.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel made four important rulings that framed its review of
    the propriety of Mr. Groia’s conduct, two of which are challenged by Mr. Groia
    on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the Appeal Panel concluded that the Hearing Panel had erred by
    applying the doctrine of abuse of process in respect of the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons,
    thereby assigning undue weight to them and effectively foreclosing Mr. Groia’s
    defence.  As a result, the Hearing Panel’s factual findings attracted no
    deference and, as urged by the parties, the Appeal Panel’s own review of the
    record was required (at paras. 200-201 and 237).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in a related holding, the Appeal Panel concluded that the Hearing
    Panel’s misapplication of the abuse of process doctrine had tainted its adverse
    findings about Mr. Groia’s motivation in advancing his allegations of
    prosecutorial misconduct.  The Appeal Panel elected to evaluate Mr. Groia’s
    conduct on the basis that he had acted in good faith and that he had held an
    honest belief in his allegations of prosecutorial misconduct throughout the OSC
    prosecution (at paras. 238 and 332).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Mr. Groia argued before the Appeal Panel that the oversight of an
    advocate’s in-court conduct is properly within the exclusive domain of the
    presiding judge, save in specific, limited circumstances.  The Appeal Panel disagreed. 
    It held that this argument was unsupported by the Act, the Conduct Rules and
    the applicable jurisprudence (at paras. 222-26).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the parties agreed before the Appeal Panel that allegations of
    prosecutorial misconduct impugning the integrity of opposing counsel should not
    be made unless they are advanced in good faith and on a reasonable basis (at
    para. 234).  They also agreed on the appropriate test for assessing when making
    allegations of prosecutorial misconduct or that impugn the integrity of
    opposing counsel can violate an advocate’s duty to be courteous, civil, and act
    in good faith, constituting professional misconduct.<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> 
    The Appeal Panel accepted that the parties’ agreed test was appropriate in this
    case, describing it at paras. 235-36:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In our view, it is professional misconduct to make allegations
    of prosecutorial misconduct or that impugn the integrity of opposing counsel unless
    they are both made in good faith and have a reasonable basis.  A <em>bona fide</em> belief is insufficient; it gives too much licence to irresponsible counsel with
    sincere but nevertheless unsupportable suspicions of opposing counsel. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In addition, even when a lawyer
    honestly and reasonably believes that opposing counsel is engaging in
    prosecutorial misconduct or professional misconduct more generally, she must
    avoid use of invective to raise the issue.  That is, it is unprofessional to
    make submissions about opposing counsel’s improper conduct, to paraphrase
    Justice Campbell, in a ‘repetitive stream of invective’ that attacks that
    counsel’s professional integrity.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before this court, Mr. Groia attacks the Appeal Panel’s ruling on the Law
    Society’s authority to discipline an advocate for uncivil conduct in court and its
    formulation and application of its test for incivility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the parties’ joint request, the Appeal Panel
    conducted its own extensive review of the record.  In carrying out this review,
    it identified the main issue for determination as “the extent to which zealous
    defence counsel may impugn the integrity of opposing counsel, and make
    allegations of prosecutorial misconduct” (at para. 234).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the timing of the acts of misconduct alleged, the Appeal Panel’s assessment
    of Mr. Groia’s conduct focused on key events during the first 70 days of the
    Felderhof trial, described above.  The Appeal Panel reviewed the evidence
    relating to these events, and Mr. Groia’s conduct in relation to each, at
    length.  It concluded that Mr. Groia had engaged in professional misconduct in
    his dealings with the OSC prosecutors in the manner alleged by the Law Society.<a
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the Appeal Panel held that, although Mr. Groia’s pre-trial
    conduct was “aggressive”, it did not constitute professional misconduct (at
    para. 252). Taken alone, Mr. Groia’s conduct during days 1-16 (including the <em>Stinchcombe</em><i> </i>motion) and during days 39-41 (the OSC’s omnibus document motion) also did
    not amount to professional misconduct (at paras. 270 and 274).  However, the
    Appeal Panel held that, starting on day 52 (the first day of Mr. Groia’s
    cross-examination of Mr. Francisco), Mr. Groia repeatedly attacked the personal
    integrity of OSC prosecutors, made allegations of prosecutorial misconduct
    without a reasonable basis to do so, and accused the prosecutors of reneging on
    their promises (at paras. 280, 285-86, 295, 306, 312 and 316).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the Appeal Panel’s view, taken as a whole, Mr. Groia’s submissions
    regarding the OSC prosecutors constituted “a relentless personal attack on the
    integrity and the <em>bona fides</em> of the prosecutors”, which included unfounded,
    repeated allegations of deliberate prosecutorial misconduct, none of which had
    a reasonable basis (at paras. 318-24).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Critically, the Appeal Panel also rejected Mr. Groia’s claim that his admitted
    statements about the OSC prosecutors could be justified by reason of his duty
    of zealous advocacy towards Mr. Felderhof.  This duty, the Appeal Panel held,
    did not require Mr. Groia to make unfounded allegations of prosecutorial misconduct
    nor did it justify his attacks on the integrity of opposing counsel (at paras.
    327-28).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Appeal Panel concluded that Mr. Groia’s misconduct had a
    serious adverse impact on the Felderhof trial: i) by causing numerous delays in
    the evidence of the first witness at trial; ii) by distracting the OSC
    prosecutors from the presentation of the evidence; and iii) by forcing the
    trial judge to become involved in many unnecessary disputes (at para. 332).  </p>
  <h4>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Divisional Court Decision</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia appealed the Appeal Panel’s Conduct and Penalty Decisions and
    its costs award to the Divisional Court.  The Law Society cross-appealed, asking
    that the penalty and costs award imposed by the Hearing Panel be restored.  Neither
    party challenged the Appeal Panel’s ruling awarding no costs of the appeal hearing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court dismissed both the appeal and the cross-appeal: <em>Groia
    v. The Law Society of Upper Canada</em>, 2015 ONSC 686 (the “Divisional Court
    Decision”).  Like the Appeal Panel, it rejected Mr. Groia’s contention that,
    save in limited circumstances, only the courts can and should oversee an
    advocate’s conduct in court, including the proposition that there are
    preconditions to the Law Society’s exercise of its disciplinary powers regarding
    uncivil, in-court conduct by an advocate.  It upheld the Appeal Panel’s
    conclusion that there was no reasonable basis for Mr. Groia’s persistent pattern
    of personalized attacks on the OSC prosecutors and their integrity.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, in reaching these conclusions, the Divisional Court held that
    the Appeal Panel’s test for incivility did not “go far enough to protect the
    importance of zealous advocacy” (at para. 72).  Consequently, the court
    restated the test by adding the requirement that, in order for in-court incivility
    to constitute professional misconduct, it must be established that the conduct
    at issue is both uncivil and that it “undermined, or … [had] the realistic
    prospect of undermining, the proper administration of justice” (at paras.
    75-76).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court went on to conclude that the constituent elements
    of its restated test were not materially different than those employed by the
    Appeal Panel.  Further, the Appeal Panel’s analysis of the propriety of Mr.
    Groia’s conduct took all necessary factors into account, including the
    requirement that the relevant conduct “might bring the administration of
    justice into disrepute” (at paras. 78, 80 and 96).  Because the Appeal Panel
    had “applied the correct test”, the court had “no hesitation” in concluding
    that the Conduct Decision, and the Appeal Panel’s reasons in support of it,
    were reasonable.  The court further concluded that the Appeal Panel’s Penalty
    Decision and costs award were also reasonable in the circumstances.  </p>

  <p class=KHeading10 style='page-break-after:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard of review on an appeal to this court from an appeal to a
    reviewing court of an administrative decision is uncontroversial.  As described
    by Deschamps J. in <em>Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. v. Canada (Health)</em>,<i> </i>2012
    SCC 3, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 23, at para. 247, this court “step[s] into the shoes of
    the lower court” and focuses on the administrative decision.  In this case, the
    question is simply to ask whether the Divisional Court identified the correct
    standard of review and applied it properly: see <em>Agriara v. Canada (Public
    Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</em>, 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at
    paras. 45-47. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court held that the correctness standard applied to review
    of the Appeal Panel’s formulation of the test for incivility in this case and that
    the reasonableness standard applied to its application of the test to the facts
    as it found them and to its Penalty Decision and costs award.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia concedes that the Penalty Decision and the Appeal Panel’s costs
    award are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness.  However, he argues
    that these rulings are unreasonable.  In contrast, Mr. Groia submits that the
    correctness standard applies to the Appeal Panel’s: i) formulation of the test
    for incivility in this case; ii) findings of professional misconduct; and iii)
    approach to the respective roles of the trial judge and the Law Society
    concerning oversight of an advocate’s uncivil conduct in court. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Law Society disagrees.  It maintains that the reasonableness
    standard applies to all the Appeal Panel’s decisions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons I will explain, I agree with the Law Society.  With respect,
    in my view, the Divisional Court erred by applying the correctness standard of
    review to the Appeal Panel’s formulation of the appropriate test for incivility.
    The Supreme Court of Canada’s jurisprudence on judicial review of
    administrative action clearly establishes that the standard of review
    applicable to the questions at issue on this appeal is the deferential standard
    of reasonableness.  </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appropriate Standard of Review</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin, where, as here, a statute provides for an appeal from a
    decision of a specialized administrative tribunal, the applicable standards of
    review are the ones that apply on judicial review, not on appeal: <em>Mouvement
    Iaïque</em><em> québécois v. Saguenay (City)</em>, 2015 SCC 16, [2015] 2 S.C.R.
    3, at paras. 29, 37-38 and 43.  Consequently, the appropriate standards of
    review in such cases are dictated by administrative law principles related to
    judicial review of administrative action, as articulated by the Supreme Court
    in <em>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</em>, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Dunsmuir</em> emphasizes, at para. 54, that on judicial review of a
    decision of a specialized administrative tribunal interpreting and applying its
    enabling or ‘home’ statute, the standard of review is presumptively that of
    reasonableness:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Deference will usually result where a tribunal is interpreting
    its own statute or statutes closely connected to its function, with which it
    will have particular familiarity. Deference may also be warranted where an administrative
    tribunal has developed particular expertise in the application of a general
    common law or civil law rule in relation to a specific statutory context.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=FR-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Supreme Court’s post-<em>Dunsmuir</em> jurisprudence
    expressly confirms that the reasonableness standard presumptively applies in
    such circumstances:  <em>Saguenay</em>, at para. 46; <em>Alberta (Information
    and Privacy Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers’ Association</em>, 2011 SCC 61,
    [2011] 3 S.C.R. 654, at paras. 30, 34 and 39; <em>Canadian National Railway Co.
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2014 SCC 40, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 135, at para.
    55; <em>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa</em>, 2009 SCC 12, [2009]
    1 S.C.R. 339, at para. <span lang=FR-CA>25; <em>Commission scolaire de Laval v.
    Syndicat de l’enseignement de la région de Laval</em>, 2016 SCC 8 at para. 32.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Dunsmuir</em> also remains the leading case on the meaning of
    reasonableness.  Justices Bastarache and LeBel explained this standard, at
    para. 47, in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated by the principle
    that underlies the development of the two previous<span style='letter-spacing:
-1.1pt'> </span>standards<span style='letter-spacing:-1.1pt'> </span>of
    reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do
    not lend themselves to one specific, particular result.  Instead, they may give
    rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions.  Tribunals have a margin
    of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions.  A court
    conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a
    decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons
    and to outcomes.  In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with
    the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the
    decision-making process.  But it is also concerned with whether the decision
    falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in
    respect of the facts and law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The presumption of reasonableness review applies in this case.  The
    questions at issue here concern the Appeal Panel’s determination whether Mr.
    Groia’s impugned conduct constituted professional misconduct within the meaning
    of the Act – the Law Society’s ‘home’ statute – and the Conduct Rules, and
    whether the Appeal Panel erred in fashioning an appropriate penalty and costs
    award.  The scope of the Law Society’s jurisdiction to discipline lawyers for
    in-court incivility involves an interpretation of the Act and the Conduct
    Rules.    These are matters squarely within the Appeal Panel’s specialized
    expertise and the Law Society’s regulatory mandate under the Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, existing Supreme Court jurisprudence confirms that the
    presumption of reasonableness applies to decisions of specialized, professional
    disciplinary bodies like the Appeal Panel.  <em>Dunsmuir</em> holds, at para.
    57, that where existing caselaw establishes the applicable standard of review
    for particular administrative action, an exhaustive standard of review analysis
    is not required.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the pre-<em>Dunsmuir</em> case, <em>Law Society of New Brunswick v.
    Ryan</em>, 2003 SCC 20, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, the Supreme Court held that a
    provincial law society’s penalty disposition in a disciplinary case was
    entitled to deference.  Justice Iacobucci concluded, at para. 42, that the
    legislator intended that the discipline committee of a provincial law society “be
    a specialized body with the primary responsibility to promote the objectives of
    the Act by overseeing professional discipline”.   Accordingly, a more
    deferential standard of review than correctness was mandated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More recently, the Supreme Court reiterated that reasonableness remains
    the applicable standard of review for decisions of professional disciplinary
    panels.  This is so even where interests under the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> are engaged:  <em>Doré v. Barreau du Qué</em><em>bec</em>, 2012 SCC 12, [2012]
    1 S.C.R. 395, at paras. 44 and 45.  I note that, also post-<em>Dunsmuir</em>,
    the British Columbia Court of Appeal applied <em>Ryan</em> in a case, like this
    one, involving a provincial law society’s discipline of an advocate for
    unprofessional, in-court conduct.  As in <em>Ryan</em>, the court held that the
    reasonableness standard applies to review of the disciplinary decisions of a
    professional regulator: <em>Goldberg v. Law Society of British Columbia</em>,
    2009 BCCA 147, 97 Admin. L. R. (4th) 15.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>Thus, <em>Ryan</em>,<em> Doré</em> and <em>Goldberg</em> all
    reinforce the application of the presumption of reasonableness for judicial
    review of a decision of a specialized disciplinary body like the Appeal Panel. 
    Although <em>Ryan</em> and <em>Doré </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>did
    not involve in-court conduct, nothing turns on this point.  </span></em><em>Goldberg</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> did involve an advocate’s conduct in court.  </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>I do not accept the argument t</span></em>hat,
    in order to properly recognize the judiciary’s constitutional responsibility to
    control what takes place in a courtroom, the correctness standard must apply
    where a discipline regulator deals with allegations of professional misconduct
    involving an advocate’s conduct in a courtroom before a presiding judge.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em>Doré</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> and </span></em><em>Ryan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> explicitly hold that regulating a lawyer’s conduct
    is squarely within the expertise of provincial law societies, attracting the
    reasonableness standard of review.  And, as </span></em><em>Goldberg</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> recognizes, nothing in the </span></em><em>Doré</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> or </span></em><em>Ryan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> courts’ holdings confines this principle to only
    those situations where a lawyer’s alleged misconduct occurs outside a
    courtroom. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>This principle is not
    new.  More than a decade before </span></em><em>Ryan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, the Supreme Court instructed in </span></em><em>Pearlman
    v. Manitoba Law Society Judicial Committee, </em><em><span style='font-style:

    to determine issues of lawyer misconduct and incompetence, that “[n]o one is
    better qualified to say what constitutes professional misconduct than a group
    of practising barristers who are themselves subject to the rules established by
    their governing body” and that this role is integral to effective
    self-governance of the legal profession: </span></em><em>Pearlman</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at pp. 880, 886-87 and 890 (citations omitted).</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Nor do I see any principled reason
    for drawing a distinction between a lawyer’s in-court and out-of-court conduct
    for the purpose of determining the appropriate standard of review.  As in </span></em><em>Ryan</em><em><span

style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em><em>Goldberg</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> and </span></em><em>Pearlman</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, the issue on this appeal is whether a lawyer’s
    conduct met the standard of professional conduct required </span></em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>under the relevant statute and professional conduct
    rules.  Regardless of where the lawyer’s conduct took place, this
    interpretation of a disciplinary body’s home statute is entitled to deference. 
    The same standards of professionalism apply whether a lawyer is in a courtroom
    or outside of one.  </span></em>Nothing in <em>Dunsmuir</em> or its progeny
    deviates from this principle.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as I explain later in these reasons, the application of the
    reasonableness standard of review in cases like this one in no way intrudes on a
    presiding judge’s authority to control the process in his or her courtroom.  If
    anything, recognition of the complementary but differing roles of the courts
    and the Law Society regarding oversight of an advocate’s in-court conduct frees
    the trial judge to focus on his or her central role – the determination of the
    issues before the court and the management of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to Mr. Groia’s contention, there is also no basis to conclude
    that the questions at issue in this case come within the recognized exceptional
    categories of cases warranting correctness review.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Dunsmuir</em>, at paras. 58-61, identifies a narrow class of questions
    for which correctness remains the applicable standard.  Only two are at issue
    here: true questions of jurisdiction or <em>vires</em> and questions of general
    law that are both of central importance to the legal system as a whole and
    outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning first to the “true question of jurisdiction” exception, the
    questions on this appeal do not come within this exception as it is
    contemplated under the applicable authorities.  First, this exception has a
    limited reach.  At para. 59 of its reasons, the <em>Dunsmuir</em> court
    indicated that “jurisdiction” within the meaning of this exception is intended
    in the narrow sense of whether or not the tribunal at issue had the authority
    to decide a particular matter.  In such cases, the tribunal must interpret its
    grant of authority correctly or “its action will be found to be <em>ultra vires</em> or to constitute a wrongful decline of jurisdiction”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, recent Supreme Court jurisprudence instructs that the
    requirement to interpret true questions of jurisdiction narrowly has particular
    significance when the tribunal is interpreting its own home statute.  In <em>Alberta
    Teachers</em>,<i> </i>at para. 34, the Supreme Court indicated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[U]nless the situation is exceptional, and we have not seen such
    a situation since <em>Dunsmuir</em>, the interpretation by the tribunal of its
    own statute or statutes closely connected to its function, with which it will
    have particular familiarity should be presumed to be a question of statutory
    interpretation subject to deference on judicial review.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the Supreme Court has also expressed serious reservations about
    whether “true questions of jurisdiction” can even be distinguished as a separate
    category of questions of law: see for example, <em>McLean v. British Columbia
    (Securities Commission)</em>, 2013 SCC 67, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 895, at para. 25, <em>per</em> Moldaver J., citing <em>Alberta Teachers</em>, at para. 37.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as I will elaborate further in these reasons, I think it untenable
    to suggest that the Law Society possesses only limited jurisdiction to
    discipline one of its licensees for incivility in court.  The disciplinary
    authority afforded to the Law Society under the Act – oversight of the
    professionalism of licensees – is the foundation for self-regulation of the
    legal profession in Ontario.  The Act casts the Law Society’s obligation to
    ensure that lawyers meet appropriate standards of professional conduct as an
    affirmative duty for the protection of the public.  It does not differentiate
    between a lawyer’s conduct inside a courtroom and his or her conduct elsewhere.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in my view, it cannot be said that the questions on appeal meet
    the test for the “questions of central importance to the legal system”
    exception to reasonableness review.  This exception relates to questions of
    general law that are “<em>both</em> of central importance to the legal system
    as a whole <em>and</em> outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of
    expertise” (emphasis added): <em>Dunsmuir</em>, at para. 60, citing <em>Toronto
    (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79</em>, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, at para.
    62.  As explained by LeBel and Cromwell JJ. in <em>Canada (Canadian Human
    Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2011 SCC 53, [2011] 3
    S.C.R. 471, at para. 22, correctness review for such questions is required “in
    order to safeguard a basic consistency in the fundamental legal order of our
    country”.  See also <em>Saguenay</em>, at para. 47, citing <em>McLean</em>, at
    para. 27.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that the nature and scope of an advocate’s professional duties
    in relation to in-court conduct have a significant impact on our adversarial
    system of justice and that the advocate’s ability to properly discharge those
    duties plays an essential role in fostering public confidence in the
    administration of justice.  For example, a majority of the Supreme Court has recently
    held that a lawyer’s duty of loyalty to the client’s cause is “an enduring
    principle that is essential to the integrity of the administration of justice”: <em>Canada (Attorney General) v. Federation of Law Societies of Canada</em>,
    2015 SCC 7, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 96.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But this does not mean that defining the scope of the advocate’s professional
    duties and disciplining advocates is outside the Appeal Panel’s specialized
    area of expertise.  To the contrary, these questions required the Appeal Panel
    to interpret and apply the Law Society’s home statute and its Conduct Rules,
    thereby engaging the Appeal Panel’s core function and expertise.  See for
    example, <em>DeMaria v. Law Society of Saskatchewan</em>, 2015 SKCA 106, 465
    Sask. R. 290, at paras. 12-16, leave to appeal refused, [2015] S.C.C.A. No. 493. 
      As a result, even accepting that some of the contested issues regarding the
    Conduct Decision are of central importance to the fair administration of
    justice, there is no question of law that falls outside the Appeal Panel’s
    specialized expertise.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also do not accept Mr. Groia’s contention that the Appeal Panel’s application
    of its test for incivility involved questions of law.  Findings of professional
    misconduct, which are fundamentally fact-dependent and discretionary in nature,
    are findings of fact or of mixed fact and law.  In this case, they are rooted
    in the particular factual matrix and contextual circumstances of the OSC prosecution.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, it is my opinion that the Divisional Court erred in
    holding that the Appeal Panel’s formulation of its test for incivility was a
    question of law, reviewable on the correctness standard.  The starting point
    for the Divisional Court’s analysis should have been the recognition that the
    Appeal Panel’s interpretation of the Act and the Conduct Rules, including of
    the behaviour that constitutes professional misconduct and the test to be
    applied in that inquiry, were presumptively entitled to deference on judicial
    review.  It was then necessary for the Divisional Court to determine whether
    this presumption had been rebutted.  It has not been.  Determinations whether a
    lawyer has engaged in professional misconduct are at the core of the Appeal
    Panel’s functions and squarely within its specialized expertise.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr. Groia’s invocation of the correctness standard rests on the
    mistaken premise that: “there is no body more aptly suited to determine when
    uncivil conduct has occurred in a courtroom than the judiciary itself,” save in
    very limited circumstances, described later in these reasons. This novel proposition
    is premised on an unduly constrained view of the expertise of the Law Society’s
    disciplinary tribunals and runs contrary to established jurisprudence.  For
    reasons I will explain, it must be soundly rejected.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore conclude that the deferential standard of reasonableness applies
    to judicial review of the Conduct Decision.</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Reasonableness of Conduct Decision</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Ryan</em> furnishes a clear description of the reasonableness
    standard and explains how it should be applied.  At paras. 51 and 55-56,
    Iacobucci J. said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is a further reason that courts testing for
    unreasonableness must avoid asking the question of whether the decision is
    correct.  <em>Unlike a review for correctness, there will often be no single
    right answer to the questions that are under review against the standard of reasonableness</em>. 
    For example, when a decision must be taken according to a set of objectives
    that exist in tension with each other, there may be no particular trade-off
    that is superior to all others.  <em>Even if there could be, notionally, a
    single best answer, it is not the court’s role to seek this out when deciding
    if the decision was unreasonable</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of
    analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from
    the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.  If any of the
    reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense
    that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision
    will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere</em> (see <em>Southam</em>,
    at para. 56).  This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness
    standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation
    is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling (see <em>Southam</em>, at
    para. 79).</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>This does not mean that every element of the reasoning
    given<span style='letter-spacing:-1.3pt'> </span>must<span style='letter-spacing:
-1.3pt'> </span>independently<span style='letter-spacing:-1.3pt'> </span>pass<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.3pt'> </span>a<span style='letter-spacing:-1.3pt'> </span>test<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.3pt'> </span>for reasonableness.  The question is
    rather whether the reasons, taken as a whole, are tenable as support for the
    decision.  At all times, a court applying a standard of reasonableness must
    assess the basic adequacy of a reasoned decision remembering that the issue
    under review does not compel one specific result</em>.  Moreover, a reviewing
    court should not seize on one or more mistakes or elements of the decision
    which do not affect the decision as a whole.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>I approach Mr. Groia’s challenge to the Conduct
    Decision with these principles in mind.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia challenges the Divisional Court’s affirmation of the Conduct
    Decision on numerous grounds.  His central contentions are captured succinctly
    in the following passage from his factum:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If [the Conduct Decision] is allowed to stand, trial judges
    will no longer truly control the proceedings before them, lawyers can no longer
    rely on how trial judges choose to conduct a criminal trial, and clients can no
    longer rely on their lawyers to speak their minds freely in open court, for
    fear that they too will be prosecuted by their regulator. Respect for judges,
    lawyers and the dynamics of a criminal trial will have given way to the [Law
    Society’s] ultimate control of the trial process.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia makes three broad submissions in support of these claims.   First,
    he argues that the Divisional Court and the Appeal Panel erred in their approach
    to the respective roles of the courts and the Law Society regarding oversight
    of an advocate’s uncivil conduct in court.  He submits that, in most instances,
    the views of a presiding trial judge on the propriety of an advocate’s in-court
    conduct control whether the Law Society can and should exercise its
    disciplinary powers in respect of such conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, he submits that the Appeal Panel and, to a lesser extent, the
    Divisional Court erred in fashioning their tests for incivility in this case. 
    He submits that the Appeal Panel erred in articulating its test by failing to
    properly consider the advocate’s duties of zealous advocacy and commitment to
    the client’s cause.  He also says that both the Appeal Panel and the Divisional
    Court erred by failing to consider, adequately or at all, <em>Charter</em>-protected
    expressive freedoms and, further, by adopting tests that fail to provide
    sufficient guidance to the profession regarding the dividing line between
    zealous advocacy and professional misconduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Third, and in any event, Mr. Groia contends that the Appeal Panel erred
    by misapplying its own test and the Divisional Court erred by concluding that
    the Conduct Decision was reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will address these arguments in turn.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(i)         Oversight
    of In-court Incivility </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia maintains that trial judges, rather than the Law Society, are
    best positioned to address in-court incivility by lawyers.  He argues that the
    Law Society cannot, and should not, discipline advocates for their uncivil
    conduct in court except in three limited situations: i) the advocate has been
    subject to a contempt finding; ii) both the trial judge’s and the advocate’s
    conduct are subject to disciplinary review; or iii) the trial judge has
    severely criticized the advocate’s conduct or complained about it to the Law
    Society.  Notably, none of the many interveners before this court supports this
    position. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel and the Divisional Court considered and rejected this
    argument.  They were right to do so.  I have no hesitation in concluding that
    Mr. Groia’s narrow construction of the Law Society’s statutory authority to
    discipline lawyers for professional misconduct is unsupportable, both in law
    and in principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, this argument ignores the plain language of the Act and the Law
    Society’s undisputed statutory obligation to govern the legal profession in the
    public interest.  No limiting language, express or implied, qualifies the Law
    Society’s duties under ss. 4.1(a) and 4.2.3 of the Act, described above, to
    ensure that practising lawyers in Ontario meet the professional conduct
    standards appropriate for the legal services they provide and to protect the
    public interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Act also prohibits any Law Society licensee from engaging in
    professional<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>misconduct<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>or conduct unbecoming a licensee (s. 33) and,
    as I have said, empowers the Law Society to conduct an investigation into a
    licensee’s potential professional misconduct (s. 49.3).  As the Divisional
    Court aptly noted, at para. 30, neither provision contains any language
    restricting the Law Society’s oversight authority to only the advocate’s
    conduct outside the courtroom, or to any of the three limited circumstances
    posited by Mr. Groia.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia’s limited jurisdiction argument also conflicts with the
    Conduct Rules, which expressly identify the duties of advocates in their
    dealings with all participants in the justice system, the courts and opposing
    counsel alike.  There is no suggestion that the Law Society lacks jurisdiction
    to form such rules.  Nor could there be.  Law Society rules governing the
    conduct of advocates are not new.  They have existed for almost a century.  And
    they have included express requirements for professionalism, including courtesy
    and civility, for many years.  Indeed, as the Attorney General for Ontario and
    other interveners point out, incivility on the part of lawyers is subject to
    discipline by provincial regulatory bodies throughout Canada.  Nothing in the
    Conduct Rules confines their application to the limited situations identified
    by Mr. Groia.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor, in my opinion, is the notion of such constraints on the Law
    Society’s oversight powers defensible as a matter of principle.  In <em>Marchand
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Public General Hospital Society of Chatham</em> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 97, leave to appeal refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 66, which
    involved uncivil conduct by an advocate towards opposing counsel in the course
    of a trial, this court unequivocally stated, at para. 141: “The unprofessional
    conduct of counsel is a matter for the Law Society of Upper Canada.”  To the same
    effect is the holding of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <em>Goldberg</em>,
    at para. 52, that the advocate in that case was “answerable to [his] Law
    Society for his [in-court] <span class=Underline>behaviour</span> in the
    conduct of the appeals” in question (emphasis in original).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Moreover, the Supreme Court also </span></em>recognized
    the role of administrative disciplinary bodies in ensuring civility in the
    legal profession in <em>Doré</em>, at paras. 60-66.  <em>Ryan</em> is even more
    explicit, confirming, at para. 42, that self-regulating disciplinary bodies have
    primary responsibility to oversee professional discipline and, where necessary,
    select appropriate sanctions.  See also <em>Pearlman</em>, at pp. 880, 886-87
    and 890.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia relies on the Supreme Court’s recent decision in <em>Federation
    of Law Societies</em>, released after the Divisional Court’s decision in this
    case, to argue that the state, including the Law Society as a “state actor”,
    cannot impose duties on lawyers that interfere with their duty of commitment to
    advancing their client’s cause.  This, Mr. Groia says, supports the conclusion
    that, save in the three exceptional circumstances described above, the Law
    Society cannot discipline an advocate for in-court zealous defence of the
    client’s legitimate interests.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  In <em>Federation of Law Societies</em>, a majority of the
    Supreme Court recognized the lawyer’s duty of commitment to the client’s cause
    as a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>.  But nothing
    in <em>Federation of Law Societies</em> countenances a lawyer’s breach of his
    or her professional obligations of courtesy, civility and good faith.  Nor does
    it contemplate that chosen regulators of the legal profession can cede to the
    courts their statutory responsibility for identifying those obligations or
    enforcing compliance with them on breach.  Indeed, as I discuss below, in
    addressing another <em>Charter</em> value – freedom of expression – the Supreme
    Court has specifically held that a lawyer’s expressive freedoms do not furnish
    unbridled licence to engage in uncivil conduct: <em>Doré</em>, at para. 65. 
    Similarly, even the important right to cross-examine, which is protected by ss.
    7 and 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em>, must be exercised in a manner consistent
    with the advocate’s role as an officer of the court and his or her other
    professional obligations: <em>R. v. Lyttle</em>, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R.
    193, at paras. 43-44 and 48.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is an additional, critical flaw in Mr. Groia’s argument.  It rests
    on a misconception of the functions and responsibilities of trial judges and
    those of the Law Society as regulator of the legal profession in Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a judge-alone trial, the trial judge is responsible for the
    determination of the issues raised and the management of the trial.  The Law
    Society is responsible to ensure that all lawyers adhere to the professional
    standards of practice that condition their licence to practise law.  In these
    differing, but complementary roles, both the courts and the Law Society seek to
    protect and enhance the administration of justice.  Although they are allied in
    this salutary objective, each contributes to its achievement in different ways. 
    As the <em>Marchand</em> court put it, at para. 148:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Just as civility in the courtroom
    is very much the responsibility of counsel, it is also very much the
    responsibility of the trial judge.  It is a shared responsibility of profound
    importance to the administration of justice and its standing in the eyes of the
    public it serves.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[8]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court recognized the shared, but differing,
    responsibilities of the judiciary and the Law Society with respect to
    incivility in court, stating, at paras. 34-35: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is no doubt that judges have a responsibility to address
    issues of incivility engaged in by lawyers who appear before them.  Indeed, it
    cannot be expected that the profession, by itself, can deal with problems of
    incivility if judges do not undertake their fair share of the task. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>However, the obligations of judges and the obligations of the
    [Law Society], as regulator of the profession, are different.  [Footnotes
    omitted.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.  The primary role of trial judges is to decide the contested
    issues and, in so doing, to safeguard the fairness of the trial, including the
    dignity and decorum of the proceeding, in order to strive to ensure a just
    result.  In this, as in other aspects of the conduct of a trial, trial judges
    have a broad discretion “to ensure fairness and to see that justice is done – and
    seen to be done”: <em>Lyttle</em>, at para. 45.  In contrast, in the context
    with which we are concerned, the primary role of the Law Society is to ensure
    the professionalism of its licensees, measured against the standards of
    practice that apply to the entire profession.  These are different roles and different
    inquiries, requiring different expertise and experience.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not suggest
    that trial judges have no authority to control uncivil conduct in their
    courtrooms.  Quite the contrary.  Trial judges are entitled to manage a trial
    as part of their trial management power, founded on the court’s inherent
    jurisdiction to control its own processes, in order to ensure that the trial is
    run effectively: <em>Felderhof</em>, at para. 43. This trial management power
    extends to the careful exercise of judicial supervision over the tactical and
    other conduct of litigants and counsel before the court: <em>Krieger v. Law
    Society of Alberta</em>, 2002 SCC 65, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 374, <em>per</em> Iacobucci and Major JJ., for the court, at para. 47.  It follows, in my view,
    that a presiding trial judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, is
    empowered to take those lawful and reasonable steps that he or she concludes
    are necessary to control uncivil or other unacceptable conduct by all
    participants in open court, including advocates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But it is a far
    different thing to argue, as Mr. Groia does, that a trial judge’s authority to
    supervise and control the progress of the trial and the conduct of its
    participants constrains the Law Society’s exercise of its statutory
    jurisdiction to regulate a lawyer’s in-court conduct in the public interest. 
    This unprecedented argument, if accepted, would sanction the abrogation by the
    Law Society of its responsibilities to the public and the legal profession, as
    expressly vested in it by the legislature. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as a
    matter of law, the Law Society’s disciplinary authority under the Act is
    unqualified.  And for good reason.  The Law Society is charged with the
    responsibility, acting in the public interest, to ensure the professionalism of
    all those whom it licenses to practise law.  To carry out this mandate, it must
    be equipped to respond to evolving and case-specific instances of
    unprofessionalism by lawyers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the
    notion that the courts must have the last or final word in assessing an
    advocate’s conduct in court rests on a flawed premise: that regulating in-court
    conduct by advocates risks interfering with a trial judge’s  authority to
    control the trial process.  The Law Society’s mandate to ensure that lawyers
    conduct themselves professionally in and out of the courtroom, does not in any
    way conflict with or erode a trial judge’s trial management power or the
    independent authority of the courts.  As I have indicated, the trial judge’s
    authority and that of the regulator exist in tandem but are focused on different
    inquiries and are exercised for different purposes.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And this gives
    rise to a third, important consideration.  The remedies available to the courts
    and the Law Society to address uncivil in-court conduct by an advocate differ
    according to their respective functions.  A finding that the Law Society cannot
    review an advocate’s in-court conduct, but must defer to the views of the
    presiding trial judge, would mean that an advocate who engaged in professional
    misconduct in court cannot be disciplined for such conduct by his or her
    regulator save at the request – direct or indirect – of the presiding trial
    judge.  This, in effect, would render trial judges the arbiters of whether the
    licences of such advocates should remain unaffected.  There is simply no basis
    for such immunity to review of unethical behaviour by the Law Society.  See for
    example, <em>Krieger</em>, at paras. 50-52.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also do not
    accept the argument that criticism or complaint by a presiding trial judge
    regarding an advocate’s uncivil in-court conduct is a necessary prerequisite to
    the Law Society’s exercise of its disciplinary powers.  I agree that the views
    of the presiding trial judge regarding the propriety of an advocate’s in-court
    conduct can and should attract considerable weight by a reviewing disciplinary
    body.  However, they are not dispositive of whether the advocate has engaged in
    professional misconduct.  Indeed, they may not even address this issue, which is
    a question for the regulator, not the courts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor does a trial
    judge’s decision not to complain about uncivil conduct in court operate, as a
    matter of law, to displace or alter the Law Society’s statutory power to
    enforce standards of professional conduct consistent with its duty to regulate
    its licensees in the public interest.  The Law Society’s exercise of its
    jurisdiction over an advocate’s in-court conduct is not an after-the-fact
    review of   a trial judge’s decisions about how to manage his or her courtroom. 
    Rather, it is a review squarely focused on the advocate’s conduct and whether
    that conduct falls below the minimum standards of professionalism for advocates
    as set by the Law Society.  As the Law Society put it during oral argument, an
    advocate’s professional obligations “do not bend” with the level or intensity
    of a particular presiding trial judge’s response to incivility.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude
    otherwise would render the regulation of professional conduct by lawyers
    subject to idiosyncratic variation, with attendant uncertainty and
    unpredictability.  This would advance neither the public interest nor the
    interests of the legal profession.  An advocate is not freed from the
    obligation to comply with the conditions of his or her licence to practise law
    by the simple act of donning his or her gown and entering the fray of a
    courtroom.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note also, as
    both the Divisional Court and the Appeal Panel recognized, that there are many
    reasons why a trial judge may elect not to criticize or complain about an
    advocate’s uncivil conduct in court, including the simple reality that
    refraining from such action in a given case may permit the proceeding to
    advance more efficiently.  Further, some judges are reluctant to intervene
    because intervention might interfere with the appearance of judicial
    impartiality.  The important point is that, just as a presiding judge’s
    affirmative criticism or complaint – before or after trial – is not a
    precondition to the Law Society’s exercise of its disciplinary authority, neither
    is a presiding judge’s inaction in the face of an advocate’s uncivil in-court
    conduct an approval of such conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I
    would reject this ground of appeal.  The Appeal Panel’s ruling that the views
    of a presiding trial judge about the propriety of an advocate’s in-court
    conduct do not control the exercise of the Law Society’s disciplinary powers
    was reasonable.  It was also correct.  </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)          Appeal
    Panel’s Test for Incivility</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia argues
    that the Appeal Panel erred in fashioning its test for incivility: i) by
    failing to properly balance the advocate’s duty of zealous advocacy with his or
    her duties of courtesy and civility; ii) by failing to take proper account of
    constitutionally-protected expressive freedoms; and iii) by creating a test that
    results in uncertainty and a lack of meaningful guidance for the profession.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia defends
    the Divisional Court’s holding that, for disciplinary purposes, uncivil conduct
    must be conduct that “will also bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute”, but submits that the Divisional Court’s restated test is itself
    flawed to the extent that it also provides that uncivil conduct “hav[ing] the
    tendency” to bring the administration of justice into disrepute is sufficient
    to constitute professional misconduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons
    that follow, I cannot accede to these arguments.  In particular, I conclude
    that the Appeal Panel’s formulation of the test for incivility in this case was
    reasonable.  In my view, it appropriately balanced the importance of zealous
    advocacy with the requirement for courtesy and civility.  Further, in
    fashioning its test, the Appeal Panel properly considered <i>Charter</i>-protected
    expressive freedoms.  Finally, the test provides meaningful guidance to the
    profession and, critically, reflects the need to maintain public confidence in the
    repute of the administration of justice.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    addressing Mr. Groia’s specific arguments, it is helpful to first consider the duty
    of courtesy and civility. </p>
  <p class=Heading><em>(a)</em><em>      Duty
    of Courtesy and Civility</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common
    ground that the concept of “civility”, as it applies to lawyers, is not easily
    defined.  While the meaning of civility for lawyers may be difficult to
    articulate with specificity, its significance to the proper functioning of our
    judicial system is beyond doubt.  In <em>Felderhof</em>, at para. 83, this
    court confirmed its importance to the legal profession, the public and the
    administration of justice:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is important that everyone, including the courts, encourage
    civility both inside and outside the courtroom.  Professionalism is not
    inconsistent with vigorous and forceful advocacy on behalf of a client and is
    as important in the criminal and quasi-criminal context as in the civil
    context. … Counsel are required to conduct themselves professionally as part of
    their duty to the court, to the administration of justice generally and to
    their clients. … Unfair and demeaning comments by counsel in the course of
    submissions to a court do not simply impact on the other counsel.  Such conduct
    diminishes the public’s respect for the court and for the administration of
    criminal justice and thereby undermines the legitimacy of the results of the
    adjudication.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court’s
    decision in <em>Marchand</em> is similarly instructive.  In <em>Marchand</em>, the
    court held, at para. 148, that the trial judge’s failure to satisfactorily
    discharge his responsibility to ensure civility in the courtroom “tarnished the
    reputation of the administration of justice” and that the facts of that case
    “underline[d] the importance being given by leaders of the bench and bar to
    improving civility in the courtroom”.  <em>Doré</em>, too, endorses the need
    for civility by lawyers, describing it, at paras. 65 and 69, as part of the
    public’s reasonable and legitimate expectations of a lawyer’s professionalism. 
    None of <em>Felderhof</em>, <em>Marchand</em> or <em>Doré </em>restricts this
    duty to only in-court conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I pause here to
    address two troubling aspects of the debate before this court about the duty of
    civility.  First, contrary to the tenor of some submissions during oral
    argument, it is wrong to diminish the force of the <em>Felderhof</em> court’s
    comments about civility, quoted in part above, on the basis that they are
    ‘merely obiter’.  In <em>Felderhof</em>, at para. 83, the court sought to
    provide guidance on professionalism, for counsel and trial judges alike, in
    particular, about the need for civility “both inside and outside the courtroom”
    and the obligation of advocates to conduct themselves professionally “as part
    of their duty to the court, to the administration of justice generally and to
    their clients”.  The court’s warning about the need for civility forms an
    integral part of the foundation for its decision.  It is a mistake to discount
    it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the
    requirement for civility by advocates has been referred to before this court by
    some as the product of the “civility movement”.  To the extent that this was
    intended to indicate that the increased emphasis in the profession on civility
    reflects the evolution in contemporary understanding about the meaning of
    professionalism for lawyers, it is unobjectionable.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But recognition
    of the need for civility by lawyers and its importance to our justice system is
    not simply a trend or a passing reform.  Nor should it be regarded as such.  As
    the commentary to r. 4.01(1) of the 2000 Rules notes, it is also not an empty
    formality because, unless order in the courtroom is maintained through dignity,
    decorum and courtesy, “rights cannot be protected”.  For this and other
    reasons, a lawyer’s obligations under the Conduct Rules include the avoidance
    of “ill-considered or uninformed criticism of the competence [and] conduct … of
    other lawyers”: 2000 Rules, commentary to r. 6.03(1).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Civility is not
    merely aspirational.  It is a codified duty of professional conduct enshrined
    in the Conduct Rules and, as repeatedly confirmed by the courts, an essential
    pillar of the effective functioning of the administration of justice.  In
    Ontario, at least, its necessity and importance in our legal system is now
    settled law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Doré</em>,
    the Supreme Court, at para. 61, citing Michael Code in “<em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Counsel’s Duty of Civility: An Essential Component of
    Fair Trials and an Effective Justice System”</span></em> (2007), 11 Can. Crim.
    L. Rev. 97, at p. 101, endorsed this definition of incivility: “potent displays
    of disrespect for the participants in the justice system, beyond mere rudeness
    or discourtesy”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Echoing <em>Doré</em>,
    the Appeal Panel noted, at para. 209, that while ‘civility’ is a useful short
    form, the concept of civility “captures many forms of unprofessional
    communications that go well beyond rudeness or lack of courtesy”.  Given the
    range of conduct that is captured under the rubric of civility, various courts
    and senior members of the litigation bar have attempted to provide clarity to
    the term and guidance as to the type of behaviour that will constitute uncivil
    conduct by advocates.  It was for this very purpose that the Advocates’ Society
    developed the <em>Principles</em>, referenced above.  The Law Society’s commentaries
    to the Conduct Rules also seek to achieve the same ends.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court also attempted to provide guidance on this issue by providing
    non-exhaustive examples of uncivil conduct, at para. 75:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is conduct that risks bringing the administration of justice
    into disrepute because it is conduct that strikes at the very qualities of what
    the justice system represents.  It is conduct that would make an impartial
    outside observer question the central tenets upon which the justice system is
    based.  It is the difference between impassioned, but reasoned, disagreements
    and… uninformed, nasty, personal tirades….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    did not attempt to provide a comprehensive definition of uncivil conduct.   It
    concluded, at para. 232, that “determining when uncivil courtroom communication
    ‘crosses the line’ is … fundamentally contextual and fact-specific”.  I agree
    and would add that the same observation applies to uncivil conduct outside the
    courtroom.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And it is
    because the question whether an advocate’s impugned conduct constitutes uncivil
    conduct warranting disciplinary review is a contextual and fact-specific
    inquiry that a precise definition of incivility is elusive and undesirable. 
    What constitutes uncivil conduct for this purpose will vary with the
    circumstances in any given case.  Incivility must be given a flexible
    definition, capable of encompassing diverse situations and different contexts. 
    What these will have in common is that they will meet the <em>Doré</em> definition of incivility: “potent displays of disrespect for the participants
    in the justice system, beyond mere rudeness or discourtesy”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The highly
    contextual and fact-specific nature of incivility necessarily requires affording
    the disciplinary body leeway in fashioning a test that is appropriate in the
    circumstances of the particular case.  The test in a given case will generally
    be reasonable if it focuses on the specific nature of the conduct at issue and
    explains why that conduct requires scrutiny in the context and circumstances in
    which it occurred.  At the end of the day, the relevant question is whether the
    type of proven conduct at issue, in the applicable context and factual
    circumstances, may reasonably and, hence, objectively be said to fall below the
    standard of conduct for advocates that the public and the profession at large
    have a right to expect.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to
    Mr. Groia’s challenge of the Appeal Panel’s formulation of the test in this
    case.  </p>
  <p class=Heading style='
line-height:normal'><em>(b)</em>     <em>Duties of Zealous Advocacy and </em></p>
  <p class=Heading style='
line-height:normal'><em>Loyalty to the Client’s Cause</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia,
    supported by some interveners, asserts that disciplinary action against him for
    his in-court submissions during the Felderhof trial, absent any complaint or
    criticism about his conduct by the trial judge, risks chilling the zealous
    advocacy to which advocates are professionally-bound and poses a threat to the
    independence of the bar, to the detriment of the public.  I would reject these
    assertions.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the duty
    of zealous advocacy.  This duty, like the duty of courtesy and civility, forms
    part of the advocate’s larger duty of professionalism.  It is a codified
    obligation under the Conduct Rules and a defining element of the advocacy
    tradition in Canada.  As the commentaries to r. 4.01(1) of the 2000 Rules
    explain, it requires that an advocate: “raise fearlessly every issue, advance
    every argument, and ask every question, however distasteful” that the advocate
    thinks “will help the client’s case”.  It also requires that an advocate “endeavour
    to obtain for the client the benefit of every remedy and defence authorized by
    law”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The courts have
    unreservedly acknowledged that zealous advocacy is fundamental to the
    advocate’s role.  In <em>Felderhof</em>, at para. 84, Rosenberg J.A. stated: “Zealous
    advocacy on behalf of a client, to advance the client’s case and protect that
    client’s rights, is a cornerstone of our adversary system.”  Quoting G. Arthur
    Martin, “<em><span style='font-style:normal'>The Practice of Criminal Law as a
    Career</span></em>” in <em>Professionalism: A Century of Perspectives</em><i> </i>(Toronto:
    Law Society of Upper Canada 2002), at p. 93, he added: “The existence of a
    strong, vigorous and <em>responsible</em> Defence Bar is essential in a free
    Society” (emphasis in original). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia’s
    position on this appeal, at heart, is that when the advocate’s duty of zealous
    advocacy conflicts with his or her duty of courtesy and civility, the public
    interest demands that the former must prevail.  The Divisional Court appears,
    at least implicitly, to have accepted this proposition.  Its approach to its restated
    test for incivility was driven by its view of the need to enlarge the
    protections afforded to the duty of zealous advocacy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am unable to
    accept the premise of an inherent collision or competition between the duty of
    zealous advocacy and the duty of courtesy and civility.  This premise misconceives
    the advocate’s duty of professionalism.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The duty of
    zealous advocacy must be jealously protected and broadly construed.  But it is
    not absolute and must not be abused.  Nor do the Conduct Rules assign it
    paramountcy.  The Conduct Rules provide for a constellation of obligations that
    together make up the overarching duty of professionalism that conditions the
    privilege of practising law in Ontario. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The advocate’s
    duty of professionalism encompasses both the duty of zealous advocacy and the
    duty of courtesy and civility.  Lord Reid’s famous statement in <em>Rondel v.
    Worsley</em>, [1969] 1 A.C. 191, at pp. 227, captures this principle well: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Every counsel has a duty to his client fearlessly to raise
    every issue, advance every argument and ask every question, however
    distasteful, which he thinks will help his client’s case.  <em>But, as an
    officer of the Court concerned in the administration of justice, he has an
    overriding duty to the Court, to the standards of his profession, and to the
    public, which may and often does lead to a conflict with his client’s wishes or
    with what the client thinks are his personal interests</em>.  Counsel must not
    mislead the Court, he must not lend himself to casting aspersions on the other
    party or witnesses for which there is no sufficient basis in the information in
    his possession…  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It bears
    emphasis that these obligations are owed by all advocates and due to all
    participants in the justice system.  As the Supreme Court affirmed in <em>Lyttle</em>,
    at para. 66, citing Lord Reid’s above-quoted comments in <em>Rondel</em>, an
    advocate’s duties are owed not only to the client, but also to the public and,
    hence, to the justice system itself and all its participants.  See also <em>Doré</em>,
    at para. 68. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Advocates’
    Society’s <em>Principles</em> afford helpful guidance to the profession on this
    issue.  They provide in part:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Advocates must “raise fearlessly every issue, advance every
    argument, and ask every question.”  At all times, however, they must represent
    their clients responsibly and with civility and integrity.  The duty of zealous
    representation must be balanced with duties to the court, to opposing counsel
    and to the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The proper administration of justice requires the orderly and
    civil conduct of proceedings.  Advocates should, at all times, act with
    civility in accordance with the <em>Principles of Civility for Advocates</em>. 
    They should engage with opposing counsel in a civil manner even when faced<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>with<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>challenging<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>issues, conflict and disagreement.
    [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>As this court has done on other occasions,<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[9]</span></span></span></a> I endorse these comments.  The <em>Principles</em> usefully inform the standard
    of conduct required and expected of advocates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the duties
    of zealous advocacy and courtesy and civility are intended to apply in tandem is
    evident from the language of the 1998 Handbook and the 2000 Rules.  Under both,
    the duty of zealous advocacy is coupled with the stipulation that it must be
    discharged by the lawyer while treating the tribunal with “courtesy and
    respect” (1998 Handbook, commentary to r. 10) or with “candour, fairness,
    courtesy and respect” (2000 Rules, r. 4.01(1)).  Thus, the duty of zealous
    advocacy is coextensive with the advocate’s duty to act with courtesy, civility
    and in good faith.  Both duties are imperatives of true professionalism by
    advocates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And it is here
    that Mr. Groia’s attack on the Appeal Panel’s test for incivility on the ground
    that his duty of zealous advocacy is overarching founders.  In <em>Felderhof</em>,
    at para. 83, this court explicitly rejected the premise of an inherent divide
    between the advocate’s duty of zealous advocacy and the companion duty of
    courtesy and civility in the conduct of litigation, stating that:
    “Professionalism is not inconsistent with vigorous and forceful advocacy on
    behalf of a client.”  The court continued, at para. 94, with respect
    particularly to the duties of defence counsel:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>But, as officers of the court and as barristers and solicitors,
    defence counsel also have responsibilities to the court and to other counsel
    and they have a duty to uphold the standards of the profession.  As I have
    said, defence counsel’s obligation to his or her client to fearlessly raise
    every legitimate issue is not incompatible with these duties to the court, to
    fellow counsel and to the profession.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Felderhof</em> makes the point, at para. 93, that counsel who are the target of professional
    vilification by their opponents are not obliged to simply ‘deal with it’.  The
    often misused adage that “a hard fought trial is not a tea party” does not license
    abusive and unprofessional behaviour towards opposing counsel.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The crucial
    point is that all participants in litigation and the public have a legitimate
    right to expect that the advocate’s duty of zealous advocacy will be tempered
    by the overriding duty to adhere to all the standards of the profession,
    including the duty to act with courtesy and civility and in good faith.  This
    case affords an apt example.  An advocate’s duty to his or her client does not permit
    the advocate to act unprofessionally.  Nor does it absolve an advocate from
    “heeding his duty to the Court and to his fellow solicitors”: <em>R. v. Elliott</em> (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 549; <em>Goldberg</em>, at para.
    45; <em>Doré</em>, at para. 65.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge
    that, on occasion, the fearless and forceful representation of a client may, as
    the Advocates’ Society put it in its factum, “[push] up against the boundaries
    of civility”.  Further, and importantly:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Advocates are only human and their patience and judgment may
    occasionally falter.  The same is true for judges, who may occasionally misapprehend
    or overreact to the conduct of counsel in their courtrooms.  Neither advocates
    nor judges should feel unduly constrained by the threat of subsequent
    disciplinary proceedings against counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For this reason,
    the advocate’s isolated lapse of judgment or occasional disparaging comment
    about another participant in litigation generally should not be viewed as
    triggering disciplinary action.  But that is not this case.  The Law Society
    disciplinary panels were concerned here with an advocate’s alleged pattern of making
    unfounded, personalized attacks on the integrity of opposing counsel and baseless
    allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.  The Appeal Panel’s test was
    specifically designed to address the serious and repetitive nature and manner
    of expression of these allegations.  It is thus essential that the nature of
    the conduct at issue be closely and carefully scrutinized before the test for
    incivility is said to have been met.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal
    Panel’s reasons reveal that it was alert to Mr. Groia’s duty of zealous
    advocacy and to the need to factor it into the formulation of its test for
    incivility and its conduct analysis.  It confirmed, at para. 7, that by
    undertaking a contextual analysis of all the relevant circumstances surrounding
    Mr. Groia’s impugned comments at the Felderhof trial, “including the important
    public interest that lawyers vigorously and courageously advocate for their
    clients”, it sought to ensure “that the challenges that confront courtroom
    advocates are fairly taken into account and do not create a chilling effect on
    zealous advocacy”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    referred at length to the principles set out by this court in <em>Felderhof</em> and <em>Marchand</em> and to the Supreme Court’s holdings in <em>Doré</em> about zealous advocacy and civility, among other authorities.  It also
    considered the Conduct Rules, the commentaries to those rules and the <em>Principles</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It went on to caution,
    at para. 211, that “‘civility’ should not be used to discourage fearless
    advocacy manifested by passionate, brave and bold language”.  It then made the key
    point that the misconduct alleged here transcended “mere rudeness”, “excess
    rhetoric” or “sarcastic remarks” and, instead, involved unfounded, direct
    attacks on the integrity of opposing counsel.  It was only after undertaking
    this analysis that the Appeal Panel accepted the parties’ agreed test.  This
    approach was reasonable and, as I will explain, amply justified by the record
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia relies
    on <em>Re Clark</em><i>, </i>1995 CanLII 1628 (Ont. L.S.T.), a decision of the
    Benchers of the Law Society, sitting in Convocation, for its comments about the
    importance of protecting the independence of the bar and its statement that, to
    the extent that the duty of zealous advocacy comes into conflict with the duty
    to treat the court with courtesy and respect, the Law Society should be
    reluctant to find that overzealousness constitutes professional misconduct.  In
    my view, <em>Clark</em> does not assist Mr. Groia in the circumstances of this
    case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Convocation’s
    decision in <em>Clark</em>, like the Appeal Panel’s fashioning of its test for
    incivility, was highly contextual and fact-specific.  As in <em>Clark</em>, the
    Appeal Panel balanced the duty of zealous advocacy with the duty of courtesy
    and civility in light of the facts established on the record.  I have already concluded
    that the Appeal Panel carefully considered the importance of the duty of
    zealous advocacy in crafting its test to ensure that the ability of an advocate
    to resolutely advance his or her client’s cause would not be undermined.  Its
    formulation of that test is entitled to deference.  Nothing in <em>Clark</em><i> </i>compels me to a different conclusion.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also
    important to note that <em>Clark</em> was decided more than 20 years ago.  Since <em>Clark</em>, the legal discourse on professional misconduct arising from
    incivility has evolved. This court's discussion in <em>Marchand</em> exemplifies that evolution. In my view, the particular context of <em>Clark</em> makes it unsuitable as a benchmark for incivility.  It does not reflect contemporary
    appreciation of the advocate’s duty of professionalism.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the circumstances
    that I have described, I see no basis on which to fault the Appeal Panel for
    its balancing of Mr. Groia’s duty to zealously advocate on Mr. Felderhof’s
    behalf with his related duty of courtesy and civility, or for its appreciation
    of the need to craft a test for incivility that took proper account of both in
    the context of this case.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One further
    aspect of Mr. Groia’s argument on this issue requires mention.  Mr. Groia,
    relying on <em>Federation of Law Societies</em>, also argues that the Appeal
    Panel’s test for incivility interferes with the advocate’s duty of commitment
    to the client’s cause.  Again, I disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Federation
    of Law Societies</em> does not hold that the duty of commitment to a client’s
    cause is absolute or open-ended.  To the contrary, at para. 93 of its reasons,
    the Supreme Court said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Committed representation does not, for example, permit let
    alone require a lawyer to assert claims that he or she knows are unfounded</em> or to present evidence that he or she knows to be false or to help the client
    commit a crime.  <em>The duty is perfectly consistent with the lawyer taking
    appropriate steps with a view to ensuring that his or her services are not
    being used for improper ends</em>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These comments
    apply with equal force to the advocate’s duty of courtesy and civility.  To
    paraphrase the Supreme Court’s words, the lawyer’s duty of committed
    representation does not permit, let alone require, a lawyer to breach his or
    her duty of courtesy and civility.  Nor does it preclude the regulator’s
    establishment and enforcement of that duty.  Rather, the duty of committed
    representation “is perfectly consistent with the lawyer taking appropriate
    steps” to ensure that his or her advocacy does not breach his or her professional
    obligations.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><em>(c)      Freedom
    of Expression</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia next argues
    that the issue of his expressive freedoms under s. 2(b) of the <em>Charter</em> and those of Mr. Felderhof, embodied in Mr. Felderhof’s constitutional right to
    make full answer and defence to the OSC charges, are engaged in this case.  He
    submits that, as a result, the Appeal Panel was required to address whether his
    allegations of prosecutorial misconduct constituted constitutionally-protected speech
    and to factor this consideration into its determination of the proper test for
    incivility.  Mr. Groia says that, having failed to do so, the Appeal Panel
    erred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this
    argument.  In my view, the Appeal Panel reasonably addressed s. 2(b) <em>Charter</em> values under the rubric of its consideration of the duty of zealous advocacy.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Doré</em> confirms, at paras. 24 and 28, that administrative decision-makers, like the
    Appeal Panel, must act consistently “with the values underlying [their] grant
    of discretion, including <em>Charter</em> values” (citations omitted).  It also
    holds, at paras. 36 and 54, that a disciplinary body’s balancing of freedom of
    speech with a lawyer’s professional obligations attracts deference.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Doré</em> further
    instructs, at para. 66, that a disciplinary tribunal’s balancing of the
    competing interests in play – freedom of expression and the need to ensure
    civility in the legal profession – is a “fact-dependent and discretionary
    exercise”.  Partially for this reason, a high degree of deference is owed by a
    reviewing court to a disciplinary tribunal’s balancing of these interests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, where
    an administrative decision-maker’s treatment of     expressive rights is<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.1pt'> </span>at<span style='letter-spacing:-1.1pt'> </span>issue,
    as here, the relevant question is whether the administrative decision-maker has
    “disproportionately, and therefore unreasonably, limited [the s. 2(b)] <em>Charter</em> right”: <em>Doré</em>, at paras. 6 and 57.  If, in exercising its statutory
    discretion, the administrative decision-maker has properly balanced the s. 2(b) <em>Charter</em> value with the decision-maker’s statutory objectives, its
    decision will be reasonable: <em>Doré</em>, at para. 58.  See also <em>Loyola
    High School v. Quebec (Attorney General)</em>, 2015 SCC 12, [2015] 1 S.C.R.
    613, at paras. 3-4, 32 and 37-42.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    did not ignore or discount expressive rights.  It twice referred in its reasons
    to the relevance of expressive rights and the need to strike a balance between
    those rights and a lawyer’s professional obligations to his client, the court,
    and other counsel and parties (at paras. 212 and 214).  It expressly considered <em>Doré</em> and, at para. 214, quoted from the Supreme Court’s instructions that
    freedom of speech must be balanced “with the need to ensure civility in the
    profession”: <em>Doré</em>, at para. 66.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its careful
    and detailed assessment of Mr. Groia’s conduct, the Appeal Panel balanced the expressive
    rights at issue in this case with Mr. Groia’s professional obligations.  It concluded,
    at para. 328:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Z]ealous advocacy did not require Mr. Groia to make unfounded
    allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.  Zealous advocacy did not dictate that
    Mr. Groia improperly impugn the integrity of his opponents.  Zealous advocacy
    did not require Mr. Groia to frequently resort to invective in describing
    opponents who were trying to do their jobs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These holdings
    are consistent with the principles outlined in <em>Doré</em>.  <em>Doré</em> recognizes, at para. 65, that expressive freedoms are not incompatible with
    professional conduct obligations, including the duty of civility: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Proper respect for these expressive rights may involve
    disciplinary bodies tolerating a degree of discordant criticism. … This does
    not by any means argue for an unlimited right on the part of lawyers to breach
    the legitimate public expectation that they will behave with civility.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>See also <em>Goldberg</em>, at paras. 57-59.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    might have said more on this issue.  Nonetheless, when its reasons are read as
    a whole, as they must be, I am satisfied that it reasonably balanced Mr.
    Groia’s expressive rights and those of Mr. Felderhof with the key objective
    under the Act and the Conduct Rules of ensuring professionalism by advocates,
    including courtesy, civility and zealous advocacy, in the public interest.  As
    the Supreme Court held in <em>Doré</em>, at para. 68, lawyers “not only have a
    right to speak their minds freely, they arguably have a duty to do so”. 
    However, in fulfilling that duty, advocates “are constrained by their
    profession to do so with dignified restraint”.  These comments are apposite
    here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore conclude
    that the Appeal Panel’s test reflects a reasonable and proportionate limit on
    both the advocate’s expressive freedoms and those of the client. </p>
  <p class=Heading><em>(d)     Vagueness
    Claims</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia’s
    vagueness claims focus, although not exclusively, on the Divisional Court’s
    restated test.  In his factum, Mr. Groia argued that the restated test is vague
    and ill-defined and that it creates “an unreviewable prosecutorial discretion”
    for the Law Society.  However, at the appeal hearing, his position on the
    restated test narrowed somewhat.  During oral argument, he challenged only the second
    part of the restated test, that is, the Divisional Court’s holding that the Law
    Society’s disciplinary process may be triggered if the conduct at issue “would
    have the tendency” to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.   Several
    interveners also attack the restated test, in whole or in part, on similar
    grounds.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from any
    complaints about lack of clarity, there are several difficulties with the
    Divisional Court’s development of a restated test for incivility.  First, for
    the reasons already given, it was not open to the Divisional Court to
    substitute its own view of the appropriate test because it disagreed with the
    Appeal Panel’s balancing of the advocate’s professional duties.  I again
    emphasize that the requisite inquiry was whether the Appeal Panel’s test was
    reasonable.  Having found that the appropriate standard of review was
    correctness, the Divisional Court did not address this issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, based on
    the Appeal Panel’s reasons, the parties before the Appeal Panel agreed to the test
    ultimately adopted by the Appeal Panel.    In these circumstances, I have
    difficulty accepting that it is now open to Mr. Groia to assert that the Appeal
    Panel’s formulation of the test was unreasonable or that the test itself is
    otherwise deficient.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings me
    to the merits of the Divisional Court’s restated test.  Simply put, the test articulated
    by the Appeal Panel is a reasonable and functional one that accounts for the
    contextual and fact-driven nature of a professional conduct inquiry regarding
    uncivil conduct in court.  Its test was owed deference by the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal
    Panel’s test provides that it is professional misconduct to make allegations of
    prosecutorial misconduct or that impugn the integrity of opposing counsel,
    unless the allegations are made in good faith and with a reasonable basis.  In
    fashioning this test, the Appeal Panel expressly balanced the advocate’s duty
    of zealous advocacy with his or her duty of courtesy and civility.  It also
    took account of the need to consider the context for an inquiry regarding allegedly
    uncivil conduct, including: i) the “dynamics, complexity and particular burdens
    and stakes of the trial” at issue; ii) the nature of the misconduct alleged;
    and iii) “the important public interest that lawyers vigorously and
    courageously advocate for their clients” (at para. 7).  These were proper and
    necessary considerations.  They were adequately, indeed fully, addressed by the
    Appeal Panel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In short, the
    Appeal Panel’s test was crafted to account for the facts of this case, and the
    interests of all parties to the OSC prosecution, including the public interest
    in the proper functioning of the administration of justice.  In my view, it is
    not vague or ill-defined.  It balances numerous factors and interests and provides
    for a contextual, fact-driven analysis, on a case-specific basis, as to whether
    uncivil conduct of a specified type (unfounded allegations of prosecutorial
    misconduct or that impugn the integrity of opposing counsel), constitutes
    professional misconduct.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test
    recognizes that, while advocates may be required to use strong and forceful
    language to advance the client’s interests, there are limits on what an
    advocate can say. It recognizes the interests of multiple participants in our justice
    system, including those who are the targets of uncivil comments.  It satisfies
    the Supreme Court’s definition of incivility, quoted above, which contemplates
    “potent displays of disrespect <em>for the participants in the justice system</em>,
    beyond mere rudeness or discourtesy” (emphasis added):  <em>Doré</em>, at para.
    61.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, respectfully,
    I regard the Divisional Court’s restated test as both unnecessary and unduly
    restrictive.  It is unnecessary because the impact of uncivil conduct on the
    administration of justice is encompassed by the Appeal Panel’s test and was expressly
    considered by it.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider, for
    example, the Appeal Panel’s statements, at para. 211, that “mandating
    ‘civility’ protects and enhances the administration of justice” and, at para.
    228, that the risk of harm arising from courtroom incivility to “either a
    particular proceeding or the justice system as a whole” is “real”.  Later, the
    Appeal Panel added, at para. 230:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The harm to the administration of justice [from in court
    incivility] is even clearer when the unprofessional courtroom communications
    take the form of attacks on the integrity of one’s opponent by unjustified and
    unfair allegations of bad faith or a lack of candour or honesty.  Holding
    lawyers accountable for such communications does not simply protect opponents
    from hurt feelings, it avoids disrupting a trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These comments
    accord with this court’s observations in <em>Felderhof</em>, at para. 83. 
    Those observations bear repetition:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Unfair and demeaning comments by counsel in the course of submissions
    to a court do not simply impact on the other counsel.  Such conduct diminishes
    the public’s respect for the court and for the administration of criminal
    justice and thereby undermines the legitimacy of the results of the
    adjudication.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    considered that, under its test for incivility, its evaluation of the propriety
    of Mr. Groia’s conduct contemplated an assessment of the harm to the
    administration of justice, if any, caused or threatened by the uncivil conduct
    at issue.  It carried out its conduct analysis accordingly. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court’s restated test equates harm to the administration of justice with trial
    unfairness.  I reject this unduly restrictive approach.  A requirement for a
    showing of trial unfairness sets the bar too high for a professional misconduct
    inquiry.  Uncivil conduct that falls short of fatally compromising the fairness
    of a trial may nonetheless impede the efficient and orderly progress of the
    trial, tarnishing public respect for and confidence in our justice system in
    the process.  This court effectively said so in <em>Felderhof</em>, at para.
    83, quoted above.  As Michel Proulx and David Layton put it in <em>Ethics and
    Canadian Criminal Law</em> (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2001), at p. 657: “an egregious
    breach of ethics may in some cases have no appreciable effect on the fairness
    of the trial, when appropriate remedies can cure any harm suffered by the
    accused.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The restatement
    of the Appeal Panel’s test necessarily implies that, to constitute professional
    misconduct, something more is required when an advocate knowingly and
    deliberately makes unfounded or bad faith comments about participants in the
    justice system.  I would also reject this proposition.  Our justice system
    cannot and should not tolerate such conduct.  Comments that are made in bad
    faith or without a reasonable basis, including those that impugn the integrity
    of opposing counsel, inevitably stain the administration of justice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[175]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the same
    reasons, I reject Mr. Groia’s claim that the Appeal Panel’s test is deficient
    because it fails to accord proper weight to the <em>Felderhof</em> court’s
    ruling that Mr. Groia’s conduct did not result in an unfair trial or prevent
    the OSC prosecutors from presenting their case at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[176]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Damage to the
    administration of justice includes, but is not limited to, compromised trial
    fairness.  Consider, for example, the facts in <em>Doré</em>.  <em>Doré</em> did not involve any issue of hearing or trial unfairness.  But it certainly
    identifies concerns about an advocate’s duty to avoid erosion of public confidence
    in the administration of justice arising from the advocate’s unfounded or
    inappropriate criticisms of a trial judge.  Our jurisprudence is replete with
    other examples of where the courts have found that an advocate’s conduct, or
    that of the state or another participant in litigation, risked undermining the
    integrity and repute of the administration of justice without compromising
    trial fairness.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[177]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, contrary to
    Mr. Groia’s contention, this court made no finding in <em>Felderhof</em> that
    his uncivil conduct had no adverse impact on the administration of justice. 
    Rather, it held that, despite what it found was Mr. Groia’s improper rhetoric
    and inappropriate conduct, the prosecution in the Felderhof case was not
    prevented from having a fair trial.  In other words, the exacting test for the
    loss of jurisdiction by the trial judge was not met: <em>Felderhof</em>, at
    paras. 79-82, 90, and 99.  It is one thing to conclude that a court has not
    lost jurisdiction due to trial unfairness.  It is another thing to infer from
    that conclusion that no damage to the administration of justice has occurred.</p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong><em>(e)      Conclusion<br>
    <br>
    </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[178]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the
    Appeal Panel’s test for incivility struck a reasonable balance among the many
    relevant considerations engaged in respect of Mr. Groia’s conduct.  Its test
    contemplated the <em>Doré</em> definition of incivility.  It identified the
    nature of the conduct at issue based on the particular misconduct alleged in
    this case (allegations of prosecutorial misconduct and allegations that impugned
    the integrity of opposing counsel).  It recognized that the impugned conduct
    took place in-court, during the course of a lengthy and hard-fought criminal
    trial.  It also explained why the allegations in question warranted scrutiny:
    to determine whether, in the context and circumstances in which they occurred, the
    allegations were made in good faith and with a reasonable basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[179]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
    Appeal Panel’s reasons for adopting its test for incivility are clear, cogent
    and intelligible.  They amply justify the adoption of the test, which squarely
    falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible on
    the law and the facts for the delineation of an appropriate test for incivility
    applicable in this case.  To the extent that the Divisional Court held to the
    contrary, it erred. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasonableness of Application of Test for Incivility</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[180]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia argues
    that the Appeal Panel erred by misapplying its test for incivility to the facts
    of this case.  He makes four main arguments.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[181]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he
    submits that the Appeal Panel erred by failing to adequately account for the
    reality that “[t]here is a natural tension between zealous advocacy and
    incivility”.  Second, he renews his submission that the Appeal Panel and the
    Divisional Court erred by failing to recognize that trial judges are best
    equipped to “police” the line between zealous advocacy and incivility in court
    and that, as a result, the Law Society cannot, and should not, exercise its
    disciplinary authority in respect of such conduct save in limited circumstances. 
    Third, he relies on his assertion that the Divisional Court and the Appeal
    Panel failed to properly consider the s. 2(b) <em>Charter</em> issues implicated
    in this case.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[182]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have already
    considered, and rejected, these submissions when addressing the reasonableness
    of the Appeal Panel’s test for incivility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[183]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr.
    Groia submits that the Appeal Panel’s findings of professional misconduct are incorrect,
    unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.  He further says that, in
    making these findings, the Appeal Panel ignored relevant evidence and read the
    record selectively.  Consequently, the Divisional Court erred by upholding the
    Appeal Panel’s flawed findings.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[184]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering
    these submissions, it must be remembered that there are two branches to the
    Appeal Panel’s test for incivility in this case.  Under the test, professional
    misconduct is established on proof of allegations of prosecutorial misconduct <em>or</em> allegations that impugn the integrity of opposing counsel, unless they are: i)
    made in good faith, and ii) have a reasonable basis.  The Appeal Panel
    concluded that both branches of the test were satisfied in this case.  However,
    if the Appeal Panel’s findings under either branch of the test are reasonable,
    professional misconduct is made out.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[185]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion,
    the Appeal Panel’s findings under both branches of the test are amply supported
    by the record before it.  Further, the Appeal Panel cannot be faulted for its scrutiny
    of the record.  It follows that its findings of professional misconduct against
    Mr. Groia are reasonable.  Accordingly, there is no basis for appellate
    intervention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[186]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    unnecessary to detail in these reasons the extensive review of the record
    undertaken by the Appeal Panel to demonstrate support for these opinions.  The
    following will suffice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[187]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, the
    Appeal Panel necessarily was concerned with events that occurred during the
    first phase of the Felderhof trial.  This included a review of the submissions
    of counsel at the pre-trial disclosure motion on December 22, 1999, the <em>Stinchcombe</em> motion during days 1 to 16 of the trial, and the OSC motion on days 39 to 42
    for the admission of documents on an omnibus basis.  The Appeal Panel held that,
    viewed individually, Mr. Groia’s conduct in the course of these motions,
    although problematic in some respects, did not amount to professional
    misconduct.  In other words, standing alone, his conduct did not cross the line
    from zealous, and sometimes aggressive and intemperate, advocacy into
    professional misconduct.  The reasonableness of this holding is not challenged
    on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[188]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    commencing on day 52 of the trial, this changed.  To appreciate the
    significance of Mr. Groia’s conduct on day 52 and following, together with the
    Appeal Panel’s associated findings, it is important to understand certain of
    the preceding events and the nature of Mr. Groia’s complaints regarding the OSC
    prosecutors as developed to that date.     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[189]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To briefly
    recap, prior to the beginning of the trial, Mr. Groia claimed that the OSC
    prosecutors had failed to discharge their <em>Stinchcombe</em> disclosure
    obligations.  This included suggestions by him that the OSC prosecutors were
    reneging on specific disclosure commitments made to the defence.  This theme of
    alleged failure by the OSC prosecutors to disclose relevant documents continued
    during the 16 day-long <em>Stinchcombe</em> motion.  Once the trial began,
    disputes about the admissibility of documents dominated the trial.  Mr. Groia
    put the OSC prosecutors to strict proof of all documents while conversely
    taking the position that the defence was able to admit, without the requirement
    of strict proof, any document that the OSC prosecutors had earlier described as
    relevant and authentic during their submissions to the court on the <em>Stinchcombe</em> motion.  Also relevant is the fact that, on the first day of trial, an OSC
    spokesperson had said that the OSC’s goal was “simply to seek a conviction”, a
    statement to which Mr. Groia repeatedly returned throughout his submissions
    before the trial judge.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[190]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By day 52 of the
    trial, Mr. Groia’s complaints regarding the OSC prosecutors’ approach to its disclosure
    obligations, the admissibility of documents and Mr. Felderhof’s right to make
    full answer and defence had undeniably matured into blunt accusations of
    deliberate prosecutorial misconduct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[191]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    considered Mr. Groia’s submissions before the trial judge on these issues in
    the context in which they were made and in light of the various motions that
    had been argued during the first 50 days of trial.  It held, at para. 280, that
    Mr. Groia had used his submissions regarding the admissibility of documents “as
    a platform to attack the prosecutors, and in particular to impugn their
    integrity, without a reasonable basis to do so”.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[192]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I see it, these
    findings were firmly anchored in the record of the Felderhof trial.  The record
    reveals that, on day 52, a dispute emerged regarding Mr. Groia’s entitlement to
    cross-examine Mr. Francisco on a document that the witness could not identify –
    a letter between two senior officers of a third party, Placer Dome.  Mr. Groia
    argued that, as the letter had been part of documents that the OSC prosecutors
    had earlier identified as relevant and necessary to its case, he was entitled
    to cross-examine Mr. Francisco on the letter without first establishing its
    relevance and undertaking to call a witness to identify the document.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[193]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his
    submissions on this issue, Mr. Groia said, among other things:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Now suddenly when it suits the defence’s purpose the Crown
    suddenly has a whole new view of life.  There has been an epiphany that’s taken
    place</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[The OSC prosecutors] told us it was probative.  They told us
    it was relevant.  They told us that met the <em>Stinchcombe</em> requirements
    and now they are telling us, “<em>Well, forget what we said then</em>.  We’re
    kind of upset that you didn’t agree to do it our way, <em>so forget all of the
    things we told you about these being relevant and probative.  Don’t believe a
    word we said</em>.”  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[194]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed in
    context, the import of these remarks is clear.  Mr. Groia was arguing to the
    court that the OSC prosecutors could not be relied upon to honour their
    assurances and that they were failing to live up to their prior representations
    regarding the relevance and admissibility of documents.  In effect, Mr. Groia maintained
    that the prosecutors were seeking to employ one standard of admissibility and
    relevance for documents useful to the prosecution and another, more onerous and
    shifting standard in respect of documents useful to the defence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[195]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The situation
    worsened the next day.  It must be remembered that by then – day 53 of the
    trial – Mr. Francisco, the OSC’s first witness, was still in the witness box
    and his cross-examination had only just begun.  His testimony had been
    frequently stalled or interrupted while counsel ‘locked horns’ before the trial
    judge on the admissibility and relevance of various documents.  The trial was
    not progressing efficiently.  To the contrary, it had become deeply bogged down
    and the difficulties in the relations between counsel, by now, were pronounced
    and extraordinarily acrimonious.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[196]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On day 53, Mr.
    Groia again sought to introduce through Mr. Francisco a document that the
    witness had never seen and could not identify.  In the course of his
    submissions that day, Mr. Groia said, among other things:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Only if this court is prepared to say that the word of the
    Government is meaningless, that the representations of the Government are
    meaningless, that the statements of the Government on the record are
    meaningless, that you can’t rely on anything the Government says anymore, is
    there any basis for my friend to make the submissions that he’s making.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[One of the OSC prosecutors] got 231 exhibits in without a lot
    of fuss and muss, in my submission, about those kinds of issues.  He’s not
    happy about it, because it’s hard work.  Well, that’s too bad, Your Honour. 
    Prosecutions are supposed to be hard work and they are supposed to be done in a
    manner that accords with the rules of law…</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>And if the Government now is suddenly saying, “You can’t rely
    on our word anymore, that you can’t rely on the fact that we’ve given you these
    documents as part of our <em>Stinchcombe</em> obligation and we only gave them
    to you because we got them from Placer Dome – so we’re going to have to
    consider, now that Mr. Groia is being a bad boy, we’re going to have to
    consider whether that’s still going to be the basis of proceeding,” then Your
    Honour, I’ve got to tell you, I don’t know how I can proceed, because I thought
    I could count on what I was being told.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>You can’t do anything in this case as the defence, Your Honour,
    without the Government wanting to take some other advantage or get some other
    document in.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[197]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    found, at para. 285, that these remarks, among others, directly attacked the
    integrity of the OSC prosecutors by alleging that they could not be relied upon
    to keep their word and that they were “lazy and incompetent”.  In the Appeal
    Panel’s view, these statements harkened back to Mr. Groia’s earlier allegations
    of prosecutorial misconduct and had no factual foundation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[198]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, Mr.
    Groia’s quoted comments cast the OSC as the “Government” and sought to persuade
    the trial judge that the OSC prosecutors could not be trusted (at para. 286). 
    The Appeal Panel concluded in this regard: “We see nothing wrong with the use
    of [the] word [“Government”] standing alone to describe the OSC; we see
    everything wrong with its use as a way of casting aspersions on opposing
    counsel without a reasonable basis” (at para. 286).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[199]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this
    interpretation of the sting of Mr. Groia’s statements is eminently reasonable. 
    The Appeal Panel’s findings were rooted in the words admittedly spoken by Mr.
    Groia on day 53 and in the evidence of events to that point in the trial. 
    However, Mr. Groia argued before the Appeal Panel, as he does before this
    court, that the OSC prosecutors’ conduct and their positions concerning the
    admissibility of documents furnished a legal and ethical basis for his attacks
    on them.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[200]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument
    cannot stand.  Mr. Groia fundamentally misunderstood the role of the OSC
    prosecutors and advanced positions on the admissibility of documents that were
    wrong in law and contrary to the rules of evidence, as described by this court
    in <em>Felderhof</em>, at para. 73:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Defence counsel is wrong to assert that because the prosecution
    concedes a document is relevant and authentic he is entitled to tender it to
    any witness without regard to whether the witness knows anything about the
    document.  A document may be relevant and authentic but counsel seeking to
    question a witness on the contents of the document must be able to demonstrate,
    if challenged, the admissibility of the witness’s answer.  Further, simply
    because a document is relevant and authentic does not mean it is admissible
    without regard to the rules of evidence, especially the hearsay rule.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[201]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court
    continued, at para. 79:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he prosecution is not duty bound to introduce all possible
    documents in examination of its witness and is not acting improperly in
    objecting to the admission of inadmissible evidence. … As the application judge
    said (at para. 33), &quot;it is inappropriate to attack a prosecutor for
    seeking a conviction. To do so, demonstrates a misunderstanding of the vital
    distinction between a prosecutor who improperly seeks nothing but a conviction
    and a prosecutor who properly seeks a conviction within the appropriate limits
    of fairness&quot;.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[202]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There can be no
    doubt, in my opinion, that Mr. Groia’s remarks on day 53 exceeded the
    boundaries of zealous advocacy and met the test for incivility.  The content
    and tenor of his words directly impugned the honesty of the OSC prosecutors,
    their even-handedness and integrity as officers of the court, and their
    commitment to their fundamental duties, as ‘ministers of justice’, to trial
    fairness and impartiality.  The Appeal Panel’s findings regarding Mr. Groia’s
    conduct on day 53 are far from unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[203]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the
    matter did not end there.  Mr. Groia’s attacks on the integrity and
    trustworthiness of the OSC prosecutors continued, unabated.  On days 55-57, his
    submissions to the trial judge included the following pointed, and disparaging,
    comments about the OSC prosecutors:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>So you are now hearing the Government say we have changed our
    mind.  Mr. Groia doesn’t want to play by our rules, so we’re going to take our
    ball and go home.  <em>And so essentially I can’t prove this document because
    the Government isn’t prepared to stand by its representations to this Court</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Well, the Government’s promises aren’t worth the transcript
    that they appear to be written on</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Since they don’t live up to their promises, then I don’t
    think I have a basis to tender the document</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>When is the Crown going to accept the fact that they are
    prosecuting a case?  <em>Why do they stand before this Court and continually
    whine about how unfair it is that the law in this country says if you want to
    prosecute Mr. Felderhof you must do so in accordance with certain fundamental
    rules</em>. … <em>They didn’t care about those rules when they stood in front
    of this court house and said they were simply here to seek a conviction</em>. 
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[204]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then, on day 58
    Mr. Groia said: “I am heartened to see that Your Honour is no more able to get
    a straight answer out of the prosecutor than the defence has been.”  And, on
    day 66: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I mean, it’s just – it’s the most nonsensical proposal from a
    Government prosecutor that one could imagine. … What do you make of that?  <em>What
    kind of proposal is that from a prosecutor who claims at least that he wants to
    conduct this trial in a responsible fashion</em>?  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[205]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These statements
    were improper and offensive.  They involved allegations of serious
    prosecutorial misconduct.  They are capable of only one interpretation: Mr.
    Groia was alleging that the OSC prosecutors were reneging on their promises to
    counsel and their representations to the court, that they were attempting to
    improperly circumvent the applicable rules of evidence, that they were not
    being candid with the court, and that they were not to be trusted.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[206]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I again
    emphasize that all this was occurring while the OSC’s first witness, Mr.
    Francisco, was still under cross-examination.  By day 65, he had been in the
    witness box for more than 31 days.  The time consumed by counsels’ disputes and
    Mr. Groia’s unrelenting assaults on the propriety of the OSC prosecutors’
    conduct kept a witness waiting interminably to complete his testimony.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[207]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was not
    without consequence.  Counsel for Mr. Francisco described the adverse impact on
    his client of the continuing delay and disruptions to the trial on day 58:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>My client over the break has advised me that he is not feeling
    well. The stress of this case is taking its toll on him. The constant in and
    outs of the court room and the uncertainty of when this is all going to be
    completed. He had visited his physician yesterday and had his blood pressure
    taken. He has a high blood pressure condition… He is under great stress again
    this morning with what transpired this morning and he is not well enough to
    continue today. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[208]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The adverse
    impact on Mr. Francisco did not stop after day 58. Counsel for Mr. Francisco again
    described this impact in eloquent and moving terms in his submissions to the
    court on day 65:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Francisco has been here for some 31 days giving evidence. 
    He has done his very best to assist the Court with his recollection of the
    events that are in issue in this case.  He would like to finish his evidence
    and is hoping to be available tomorrow and, as of the moment, that is certainly
    his intention.  I will advise my friends at the end of the day as to whether or
    not his condition remains such that he can testify tomorrow. … I know he has
    been here many days where there has been a lot of debates about admissibility
    of documents or admissibility of evidence and I would ask Your Honour and
    counsel to consider ways and means of doing that without the necessity of Mr.
    Francisco to be in the witness box, either by resolving these matters as best
    you can today with the time available. … But the concern I have is that the
    cross-examination has now been on for two weeks.  Before that the examination-in-chief
    went over a month.  And Mr. Francisco, his health is suffering.  Counsel have
    to represent their own client’s interests.  It’s the Court that protects the
    witness and I ask Your Honour to consider the interests of Mr. Francisco and
    devise with counsel a way and a means of finishing this witness’s evidence in
    the time allotted it would because if it – I really am asking to speak to you
    on this because I am concerned about his health and I want the Court to be
    aware of it and I would ask the Court to protect him, to protect his interests
    because in my submission, I don’t feel that he is being accorded the kind of
    consideration that ought to be given to him.  He has testified at length.  He
    is being used as a means of putting documents in by both counsel that normally
    would not happen in the way it has happened and as a result he has to sit in
    the box and read documents that he hasn’t even authored, or in some instances
    even received, with a view to adducing evidence or not adducing evidence.  I
    would ask then the Court to please protect my client’s interests…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[209]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    was alert to this important issue, stating at para. 313:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Finally, we note that on Day 58 counsel for Mr. Francisco
    raised concerns about whether he could be excused for the day while the
    submissions regarding evidentiary matters continued.  This came in the context
    of the witness asking Mr. Groia when he could return and receiving the response,
    “Next week I would suggest, Mr. Francisco. …We will be a while.”  Over the next
    few days it was apparent that the lengthy hearing, and frequent delays, were in
    fact taking a toll on the health of this witness, who was unable to testify for
    periods of time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[210]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is against
    this backdrop that the Appeal Panel concluded, at paras. 318-22, 324 and 332:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Taken as a whole, the submissions we have excerpted can best be
    described as a relentless personal attack on the integrity and the <em>bona
    fides</em> of the prosecutors.  It is important to emphasize that the examples
    we have selected provide some flavour, but it is difficult to convey the
    cumulative effect of the unabated repetition over the course of 10 hearing days
    of Mr. Groia’s vehement and very lengthy attacks on the prosecutors.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>These attacks were personal in nature. … Taken together, in
    context, over the course of this lengthy trial, it is very clear that they were
    decidedly personal.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>These attacks were aimed at the integrity of the prosecutors,
    by repeatedly asserting that they had broken their ‘promises’ and could not be
    relied on to do what they represented to the court and were, in a word, untrustworthy.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>These attacks also included numerous allegations of deliberate<span
style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>prosecutorial<span style='letter-spacing:
-1.2pt'> </span>misconduct:<span style='letter-spacing:-1.2pt'> </span>that the
    prosecutors intended to ‘win at all costs’, that their conduct offended the
    ethical principle that the duty of the Crown is not to seek a conviction, that
    they were deliberately putting the evidence though a ‘conviction filter’, and,
    most troubling, that they were intentionally acting so as to ensure that Mr.
    Felderhof did not obtain a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nothing the prosecutors did justified this onslaught.  These
    attacks on their integrity and <em>bona fides</em> did not have a reasonable
    basis.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Likewise, we conclude that Mr. Groia had no reasonable basis on
    which to attack either the integrity of the prosecutors or their motives.  The
    prosecutors had not promised that they would introduce all relevant documents,
    regardless of the rules of evidence.  They were under no obligation to call
    evidence favourable to the defence.  They had not resiled from their promises. 
    Their positions on evidentiary issues were not improper and were often correct.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A]ccepting that Mr. Groia was not deliberately misrepresenting
    the law and was not ill-motivated, we are nevertheless satisfied that Mr.
    Groia’s misconduct had a serious adverse impact on the trial, by causing
    numerous delays in the evidence of the trial’s first witness, by distracting
    the prosecutors from the presentation of the evidence, and by forcing the trial
    judge to become involved in many unnecessary disputes.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[211]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having reviewed
    the relevant parts of the record, described in part above, I conclude that
    these critical findings were amply justified.  Mr. Groia’s remarks on the days
    in question, quoted above, were uncivil and discourteous and exceeded even the
    most broadly defined reasonable boundaries of zealous advocacy.  They struck,
    without a reasonable basis, at the heart of the OSC prosecutors’ duties to the
    court, to opposing counsel and to the administration of justice – in short, at
    their most basic duties as ‘ministers of justice’ and officers of the court. 
    They also affected the orderly progression of the trial and the dignity of the
    proceedings and contributed to the delay in the completion of the testimony of
    the first witness at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[212]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trials are not
    just about the resolution of the immediate dispute between the parties.  They
    are also about the trial judge, the witnesses, court staff, the appropriate use
    of court resources, and the public.  And courtrooms are not just places where
    advocates and judges come to work.  They are the community’s chosen forum for public
    dispute resolution and the administration of the criminal law.  In short,
    trials in our courtrooms engage the public interest in its multiple
    dimensions.  Advocates have responsibilities to the court, their client and the
    administration of justice.  The propriety of an advocate’s in-court conduct
    must be assessed under the Act and the Conduct Rules with this consideration at
    the forefront.  I have no doubt that what occurred in this case, if viewed by
    an informed and objective member of the public, could only have diminished
    public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[213]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have
    attempted to emphasize, Mr. Groia began making allegations of deliberate
    prosecutorial misconduct on the first day of the trial.  He repeatedly returned
    to these allegations throughout the proceeding.  When he began his
    cross-examination of Mr. Francisco, on day 52, he forcefully renewed his
    attacks on the integrity of the OSC prosecutors.  Nothing the trial judge did
    or said stopped Mr. Groia from repeatedly making unfounded allegations of
    prosecutorial misconduct or comments that impugned the integrity of the OSC
    prosecutors.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[214]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider that,
    on day 61, the trial judge told Mr. Groia to refrain from making allegations
    unless they were based on a different factual foundation.  On day 65, he intervened
    when Mr. Groia again began to allege prosecutorial misconduct.  But even this
    did not deter Mr. Groia from making inappropriate and offensive remarks on day
    66, set out above.  By then, regrettably, the pattern had been set.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[215]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that Mr.
    Groia submits that, in assessing the propriety of his submissions about the OSC
    prosecutors, the Appeal Panel ignored evidence from the trial transcripts and
    from the participants in the proceeding before the Hearing Panel, including the
    testimony of Brian Greenspan and Nicholas Richter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[216]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am unable to
    accept this submission.  The Appeal Panel made clear that it had reviewed the
    trial transcripts from the first phase of the Felderhof trial, and the defence
    evidence led at the hearing before the Hearing Panel.  It stated, at para. 238:
    “we have conducted our own assessment of Mr. Groia’s submissions during the [Felderhof]
    proceedings in light of their context, <em>including his explanations and those
    of his witnesses</em>” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[217]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal
    Panel’s conduct analysis supports this statement.  In its reasons, the Appeal
    Panel summarized Mr. Groia’s explanations for his conduct and outlined, at
    length, his submissions before the trial judge during pre-trial motions and phase
    one of the Felderhof trial.  The Appeal Panel indicated, at para. 241:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Our summary [of Mr. Groia’s submissions] follows our own
    comprehensive review of the transcripts, together with summaries prepared by
    the parties to these proceedings.  We have reviewed Mr. Groia’s remarks in
    their context, often by relying on Mr. Groia’s own explanations in the course
    of the hearing panel proceeding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[218]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no basis
    on which to conclude that the Appeal Panel did not do precisely what it said it
    had done.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[219]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia’s real
    complaint on this issue is that the Appeal Panel did not accept, and discuss in
    detail in its reasons, his explanations for his conduct and the testimony of
    his witnesses before the Hearing Panel relating to those explanations.  This is
    not a basis for concluding that the Conduct Decision is unreasonable.  There
    can be no serious suggestion that the Appeal Panel’s reasons fail to meet the
    sufficiency of reasons standard set out in <em>Newfoundland and Labrador
    Nurses’ Union v. Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board)</em>, 2011 SCC 62,
    [2011] 3 S.C.R. 708, <em>Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and
    Immigration), </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>[1999] 2 S.C.R. 817</span></em> and related cases.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[220]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    had considerable latitude to determine how much of the trial record and of the
    record before the Hearing Panel had to be reviewed in its reasons to support
    its professional misconduct findings.  Those findings, in the end, flowed
    directly from Mr. Groia’s admitted submissions before the trial judge.  It was
    his own words, in the context and circumstances in which they were uttered,
    that established his professional misconduct.  Having reviewed the evidence led
    by Mr. Groia before the Hearing Panel, I see nothing in the testimony of his
    witnesses that endorses or approves the type of remarks made and the rhetoric
    used by him in his above-quoted submissions at the Felderhof trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[221]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore
    reject Mr. Groia’s contention that the Appeal Panel misapplied its test for
    incivility and erred in its review of the record.  To the contrary, its review
    was comprehensive, its findings were tied directly to the events reflected in
    the record, and its Conduct Decision was reasonable.</p>
  <h4>(3)      Reviewing Courts’ Reasons</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[222]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties and
    several interveners put in issue the proper use of the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons
    by the Law Society disciplinary panels.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[223]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia,
    supported by some interveners, argues that the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons were
    not admissible before the Hearing and Appeal Panels for proof of professional
    misconduct.  In the alternative, Mr. Groia submits that even if the Reviewing
    Courts’ Reasons were admissible, the Appeal Panel erred by attaching undue
    weight to them and by treating certain of the statements contained in them regarding
    his conduct as dispositive of the allegations of professional misconduct made
    against him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[224]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Law Society
    disagrees.  It submits that the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons were admissible
    before the Hearing and Appeal Panels under both the normal rules of evidence
    and the Law Society’s <em>Rules of Practice and Procedure</em>.  It contends that
    the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons were highly relevant evidence that were
    admissible, not simply for narrative value, but as proof that: i) Mr. Groia’s
    positions at the Felderhof trial regarding the role of the OSC prosecutors and
    the admissibility of documents were wrong in law; and ii) there was no
    reasonable basis for Mr. Groia’s personal attacks on the OSC prosecutors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[225]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I mentioned
    earlier, the Appeal Panel concluded that the Hearing Panel had erred by holding
    that it would be an abuse of process to allow Mr. Groia to relitigate the
    Reviewing Courts’ findings.  It held, for reasons it explained, that the
    Reviewing Courts’ Reasons, although admissible, should be given limited weight
    in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[226]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court agreed.  In its view, the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons were admissible
    before the Appeal Panel under r. 24.08 of the Law Society’s <em>Rules of
    Practice and Procedure</em> and under the traditional rules of evidence as part
    of the narrative of the case.  Further, the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons were
    entitled to “limited weight” because Mr. Groia had not been a party to the JR
    Application and because neither Reviewing Court had addressed whether Mr.
    Groia’s conduct amounted to professional misconduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[227]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is
    unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal to resolve the issue of the
    permissible use of the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons.  The Appeal Panel expressly
    held that they were to be afforded little weight and that they were not
    determinative of the professional misconduct allegations made against Mr.
    Groia.  The Appeal Panel’s reasons confirm that, in fact, it did not treat the
    Reviewing Courts’ Reasons as dispositive of the issues before it.  Instead, the
    Appeal Panel conducted an independent review of the record, outlined above, and
    drew its own conclusions regarding the propriety of Mr. Groia’s conduct in
    light of the Act and the Conduct Rules.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[228]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor, contrary to
    Mr. Groia’s contention, did the Appeal Panel assign undue or improper weight to
    the Reviewing Courts’ Reasons in assessing whether Mr. Groia’s conduct
    constituted professional misconduct under the Act and the Conduct Rules.  The
    Appeal Panel’s references in its conduct analysis to the Reviewing Courts’
    Reasons were limited to statements of law and/or policy relating to Mr. Groia's
    legal errors on the issues of admissibility of documents (at paras. 277-79 and
    310), and prosecutorial misconduct and the role of the OSC prosecutors (at paras.
    290-94). The Appeal Panel specifically noted, at para. 280, that these legal errors,
    on their own, could not form the basis of a finding of professional misconduct. </p>
  <h4 style='
line-height:normal'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appeal Panel’s Penalty Decision and Costs Award <br>
    <br>
  </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[229]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia argues
    that the Divisional Court erred in holding that the Appeal Panel’s imposition
    of a one-month licence suspension was reasonable.  He argues that the Appeal
    Panel’s Penalty Decision was arbitrary and based on unsupportable findings of
    fact: that Mr. Groia’s conduct amounted to professional misconduct; that his
    conduct had a serious adverse impact on the Felderhof trial; and that his
    conduct was the impetus for the JR Application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[230]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These factual
    findings, as I have already concluded, were open to the Appeal Panel on the
    record.  They established that Mr. Groia’s conduct was neither trivial nor
    spontaneous.  To the contrary, it was serious and persistent.  Further, on the
    Appeal Panel’s findings, it had a significant negative impact on the progress
    of the Felderhof trial, opposing counsel and Mr. Francisco.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[231]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Panel
    also took mitigating factors into account when crafting an appropriate penalty. 
    It stressed, in particular, that Mr. Groia had no prior discipline history,
    that he had not engaged in similar misconduct since the Felderhof trial, and
    his acknowledgement that he would “do it differently” and “choose different
    words” if he had a chance.  It also considered those cases relied upon by Mr.
    Groia to support his claim that a fit penalty was a reprimand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[232]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    Appeal Panel engaged in a balanced and fair assessment of Mr. Groia’s circumstances
    and those surrounding his conduct when fashioning an appropriate penalty.  Its
    Penalty Decision is entitled to considerable deference on the reasonableness
    standard: see <em>Ryan</em>, at para. 42.  On the Appeal Panel’s findings, I
    agree with the Divisional Court that the imposition of a brief licence
    suspension cannot be said to be unreasonable or unjustified.  Consequently,
    there is no basis for appellate interference with the licence suspension
    imposed by the Appeal Panel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[233]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia also
    argues that the Appeal Panel’s varied award of the costs of the proceeding
    before the Hearing Panel amounted to an additional and unwarranted penalty.  As
    I have explained, the Appeal Panel reduced the costs awarded to the Law Society
    by the Hearing Panel from $246,960.53 to $200,000.  Mr. Groia says that this
    reduction was arbitrary and that, given the novel and public importance of the
    issues raised before the Hearing Panel, no costs should have been awarded.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[234]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree.  No
    error in principle in the challenged costs award has been demonstrated, nor has
    any reason to depart from the general rule that the reasonable costs of
    investigating and conducting a disciplinary proceeding should not be borne by
    the profession as a whole where a determination adverse to the defending lawyer
    has been made.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[235]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Appeal
    Panel’s discretionary costs reduction was based on Mr. Groia’s success before
    the Appeal Panel in arguing, among other matters, that the abuse of process
    doctrine did not apply and that the Hearing Panel had erred in holding to the
    contrary.  The reduction in costs ordered by the Appeal Panel clearly operated
    to Mr. Groia’s benefit.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[236]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal
    Panel’s ruling on costs is also entitled to deference.  Like the Divisional
    Court, I conclude that the reduced costs of the Hearing Panel proceeding awarded

  <h4>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Divisional Court’s Costs Award</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[237]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groia also
    challenges the Divisional Court’s $30,000 award of costs to the Law Society. 
    He renews his submission, made before the Divisional Court, that the novel and
    public interest issues raised in this case militated in favour of awarding no
    costs of the proceedings before the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[238]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court considered this argument.  It accepted that some measure of public
    interest was engaged, but concluded that this alone did not distinguish this
    case “from any number of other appeals that raise important legal issues:” <em>Groia
    v. The Law Society of Upper Canada</em>, 2015 ONSC 1680, at para. 5.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[239]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    discretionary costs ruling cannot be set aside unless it is tainted by an error
    in principle or was plainly wrong: <em>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</em>,
    2004 SCC 9, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303, at para. 27.  The Divisional Court considered
    Mr. Groia’s argument that costs should not be awarded because of the public
    interest and novel issues raised, and rejected it.  It did not err in principle
    in doing so.  Nor can I say that its costs award was plainly wrong.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[240]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would
    uphold the Divisional Court’s costs award. </p>
  <p class=Heading>VI.      Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[241]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The requirement
    of professionalism for lawyers, both inside and outside a courtroom, including
    zealous advocacy accompanied by courtesy, civility and good faith dealings, secures
    the nobility of the profession in which lawyers in this province are privileged
    to practise.  The Appeal Panel concluded that this requirement was breached in
    this case.  This conclusion, in my opinion, was both reasonable and correct.  I
    would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[242]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the
    different standards of review and tests for incivility applied by the Appeal
    Panel and Divisional Court, this appeal engaged issues of significant
    importance to the legal profession and the public.  In my view, guidance from
    this court on the issues raised was both necessary and appropriate.  In the
    circumstances, I would make no order as to the costs of this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[243]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not wish to
    conclude these reasons without expressing the court’s appreciation to all

    submissions advanced by counsel.</p>

    They told Mr. Groia to cut it out and smarten up. He listened, and he did.

    at para. 119:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Civility is not merely aspirational.  It is a codified duty of
    professional conduct enshrined in the Conduct Rules and, as repeatedly
    confirmed by the courts, an essential pillar of the effective functioning of
    the administration of justice.  In Ontario, at least, its necessity and
    importance in our legal system is now settled law.</p>

    and particular burdens and stakes of the trial,” including the reaction of the
    trial judge to the member’s conduct, the analysis actually conducted by the
    Appeal Panel failed to take into account, in any meaningful way, how the trial
    judge ruled on the complaints by the OSC about Mr. Groia’s conduct and how Mr.
    Groia responded to the trial judge’s rulings on those complaints. In brief, the
    Appeal Panel examined Mr. Groia’s conduct as if only two people were present in
    the courtroom – Mr. Groia and the prosecutor. The Appeal Panel ignored the
    third person – the trial judge – and failed to give any meaningful
    consideration to his rulings about Mr. Groia’s conduct in its assessment of
    whether that conduct amounted to professional misconduct. That, in my view,
    rendered the Conduct Decision both incorrect and unreasonable.</span></p>

    Groia had committed professional misconduct for statements he made in court
    should be reviewed on the correctness standard. My proposition is a simple one.
    Under our Constitution it is the independent judiciary that controls what takes
    place in a courtroom. In the context of a regulator’s inquiry into a
    barrister’s in-court conduct, that principle translates into the application of
    a correctness standard of review. By employing a correctness standard, the
    judiciary maintains its ultimate control over the courtroom by having the “last
    word”, so to speak, on whether a barrister’s in-court conduct merits
    professional misconduct sanction.</span></p>

    SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para. 42. As my colleague notes, the Divisional
    Court applied the correctness standard to review the Appeal Panel’s formulation
    of the test for professional misconduct and the reasonableness standard to the
    Appeal Panel’s application of the test to the facts. In my view, because the
    barrister’s conduct at issue took place during a court proceeding, the
    correctness standard applies to both the review of the test and to its

    regulator was inquiring into conduct that took place within a courtroom, the
    preserve of an independent branch of our government – the judiciary: </span><em>Ocean
    Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia (General Manager, Liquor Control and
    Licensing Branch)</em><span style='line-height:200%;background:white'>, 2001
    SCC 52, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 781, at paras. 23 and 30. Here, the regulator was not
    considering where a pipeline should run, or whether entitlement to social
    benefits had been established. Instead, the regulator was examining conduct
    that occurred within the daily workplace of the judiciary.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>It should not be difficult in the course of judicial review to
    identify legal questions requiring disposition by a judge.&nbsp; There are
    three basic legal limits on the allocation of administrative discretion.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Firstly, the Constitution restricts the legislator’s ability to
    allocate issues to administrative bodies which&nbsp;<span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>s. 96</span>&nbsp;of the <i><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Constitution Act, 1867</span></i> has allocated to the courts.&nbsp; The logic of the constitutional limitation
    is obvious.&nbsp; If the limitation did not exist, the government could
    transfer the work of the courts to administrative bodies that are not
    independent of the executive and by statute immunize the decisions of these
    bodies from effective judicial review.&nbsp; The country would still possess an
    independent judiciary, but the courts would not be available to citizens whose
    rights or interests are trapped in the administration.</p>

    argue that the Law Society lacks the jurisdiction to review what barristers do
    in courtrooms, except where (i) the barrister has been subject to a contempt
    finding, (ii) both the trial judge’s and barrister’s conduct are subject to
    disciplinary review, or (iii) the trial judge has severely criticized the

    the Law Society the power to determine whether a licensee has breached that
    proscription: ss. 33, 34 and 49.3. Some licensees practise as barristers. Part
    of their professional work occurs in the courtroom. On the face of the statute,
    the Law Society has the jurisdiction to investigate a barrister’s in-court
    conduct, and Mr. Groia has not challenged the constitutionality of that
    statutory scheme.</span></p>

    judiciary. That distinctive fact means the standard of review analysis in the
    present case cannot be driven by the typical quest to ascertain the

    review analysis involves ascertaining whether the legislature has limited the
    scope of review of a tribunal’s decision through the inclusion of a privative
    clause in the tribunal’s home statute. A privative clause may evidence “a
    legislature’s intent that an administrative decision maker be given greater
    deference and that interference by reviewing courts be minimized”: </span><em>Dunsmuir</em><span

    symmetrical. The absence of a privative clause may carry less weight than the
    presence of one. In </span><em>Ryan</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, the
    Supreme Court discounted the absence of a privative clause in the New Brunswick
    Law Society’s home statute because “[t]he </span><span style='line-height:200%;

    deference notwithstanding the absence of a privative clause”: at para. 29.</span></p>

    Society Act</em><span style='line-height:200%'> is a hybrid one – any party
    other than the Law Society may appeal a decision of the Appeal Division “on any
    grounds,” but the Law Society may appeal only on a question that is not a
    question of fact alone, except in the case of a cost order: ss. 49.39(1)-(2).
    Although this privative clause suggests a low standard of deference to the
    decisions of the Law Society, </span><em>Ryan</em><span style='line-height:

    degree of deference.</span></p>

    misconduct. Adopting the correctness standard of review for in-court conduct
    does not oust the jurisdiction of the Law Society to entertain and decide
    complaints about a member’s in-court conduct.  A correctness standard, however,
    gives the courts the final word on whether a barrister’s in-court conduct
    amounts to professional misconduct. If the reviewing court disagrees with the
    discipline tribunal's conclusion, it would be free to substitute its own
    opinion.  In other words, under the correctness standard, the courts remain the
    final umpires of the propriety of what barristers do in courtrooms.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>It is the role of criminal defence counsel, frequently a most
    difficult role, to fully and fervently represent those persons accused of
    criminal offences, recognizing that their efforts will often place them at odds

  <p class=DSubquote>Defence counsel run the risk of unpopularity or

    By its nature, a professional discipline proceeding is an exercise in the
    retrospective examination of counsel’s conduct by those who were not present
    when the conduct occurred and who lack the ability to re-create, with precision
    and certainty, exactly what took place. A discipline review is largely
    transcript-based, restricting the reviewer’s ability to understand the sense
    and nuance of the moment. Retrospective transcript-based reviews contain
    inherent limitations which can produce an artificial understanding of what took

    conduct of a barrister, as well as in the interests they seek to protect, a
    risk does exist that a regulator’s review of in-court conduct could end up
    second-guessing how the presiding judge responded to the barrister’s conduct. A
    regulatory discipline review that second-guesses how a judge managed a court
    proceeding would impermissibly step over the constitutional boundary between

    pass, and in order to respect the primacy of judicial control over what goes on
    in the courtroom, the Law Society, when considering whether a barrister’s
    in-court conduct falls to the level of professional misconduct, must pay
    careful attention to and give deference to any rulings the presiding judge made
    concerning the misconduct alleged, together with the barrister’s response to

    the Law Society must consider how the presiding judge responds to the
    barrister’s conduct. First, when a barrister walks into a courtroom, the
    barrister reasonably expects that he or she can look to the presiding judge for
    direction as to what conduct is on-side, and what is off-side. That expectation
    is a reasonable one. If a barrister complies with and satisfies the directions
    given by the presiding judge about how to act during a proceeding, a great
    unfairness could arise if, after the proceeding ends, the barrister is exposed
    to allegations of professional misconduct.</span></p>

    courtroom dynamic and the great difficulty of recreating that dynamic
    after-the-fact, the presiding judge, as the representative of the public
    interest who is “on the scene”, stands in the best position to gauge the
    appropriateness of the conduct of those participating in the proceeding. The
    presiding judge is closest to the facts and best positioned to be alive to the context
    of, and nuances in, the unfolding human drama. </span></p>

    of the Law Society to take into account, in a meaningful way, how the presiding
    judge deals with the barrister’s conduct will, as a practical matter, narrow
    the Law Society’s scope for review of in-court conduct by a member. For
    example, I have difficulty seeing how a regulator’s finding of misconduct could
    meet the correctness or reasonableness standard where it sanctions a barrister
    for conduct which was the subject of complaint to the presiding judge, on which
    the presiding judge ruled, and where the presiding judge was satisfied with
    counsel’s response to the ruling. Perhaps, if the trial judge’s ruling on the
    barrister’s conduct had resulted in an unfair trial, professional misconduct by
    the member would arise. But that would be a most exceptional case. </span></p>

    Before this court, the intervener, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association,
    submits there was no agreement on the appropriate test. The CCLA submits the
    Appeal Panel took an agreement amongst parties with respect to how counsel
    could properly advance allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and then
    wrongly flipped, or re-characterized, that agreement into one governing the
    entire inquiry into whether professional misconduct had occurred.</span></p>

    the CCLA’s submission. The parties certainly agreed on how to approach one
    issue – “the extent to which zealous defence counsel may impugn the integrity
    of opposing counsel, and make allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.” The
    Appeal Panel recorded, at para. 234, that the parties and interveners “agreed that
    it is wrong to make allegations of prosecutorial misconduct that impugn the
    integrity of opposing counsel unless those allegations are made in good faith

    Appeal Panel’s reasons that the parties disagreed on whether a finding of
    professional misconduct required the presence of other factors. For example,
    the Appeal Panel specifically rejected, at paras. 222 and 224, Mr. Groia’s
    submission that the Law Society should not discipline a lawyer for conduct in
    open court unless the lawyer had been found in contempt, the judge had referred
    the lawyer’s conduct to the Law Society, or the behaviour of the lawyer and
    judge is so egregious that both are subjected to discipline. The Appeal Panel
    also rejected, at paras. 227-28, the submission that disciplinary action was
    only appropriate where there existed “egregious or continuous conduct that
    serves to threaten or undermine the integrity of the administration of
    justice”, or is “reasonably likely to cause a miscarriage of justice.”</span></p>

    conduct that it is rude, unnecessarily abrasive, sarcastic, demeaning, abusive

    a good faith basis for the attack, or the individual counsel has a good faith

    complained about it and asked the trial judge to rule on the defence’s
    allegation. The prosecution’s complaints started on Day 54, when Mr. Groia
    began raising the issue of prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecution made the
    following submission to the trial judge:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>I have been accused of
    professional misconduct. Mr. Smith has been accused of professional misconduct.
    The prosecution has been alleged to have advanced a prosecution in violation of
    its responsibilities as a prosecutor and its duties of fairness to the accused.</p>

    maligning what it is we seek to do and the way we go about seeking to do it.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>I have sat and I have listened. 
    Sometimes I have got up, Your Honour, and tried to respond to these issues.
    What I will do is I will let the record speak for itself.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It is our respectful submission
    that we have done absolutely nothing improper, that we have conducted ourselves
    in a manner entirely in accord with our duties, that the examination in-chief
    of Mr. Francisco, as the record will reflect, and as Your Honour presiding over
    that cross - examination in-chief rather, was conducted in a manner entirely in
    accordance with law. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We obviously take fundamental
    objection to what Mr. Groia has to say. What we will do is let the record speak
    for itself. I'm quite happy to do that. But if Your Honour - if Your Honour
    should agree with what Mr. Groia has had to say, then I would invite you to
    stay these proceedings because, in my submission, there is no basis to proceed
    if the Crown is doing so in an abusive manner.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We fundamentally, fundamentally,
    resist any suggestion that anything that has been done with respect to the
    conduct of the Crown in this case has been inappropriate.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>…</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Well, it's something that's been
    brought in which allegations of prosecutorial misconduct have been brought to
    Your Honour's attention and I am asking that Your Honour rule on that, because
    if you are of the view that the Crown is proceeding in an abusive manner, then
    I invite you to stay these proceedings. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>…</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>We fundamentally, fundamentally,
    are opposed to those accusations, fundamentally reject those accusations. I'm
    not going to respond. I'm not going to go and get into a personal attack on Mr.
    Groia and things of that nature, the way he has been personally attacking us.
    But if you think there is merit to what he is saying, Your Honour, there is
    little point in proceeding with this prosecution and, with the greatest of
    respect, in my respectful submission, Mr. Groia's submissions are neither
    founded in fact, nor founded in law and I ask that they be rejected and I ask
    that Your Honour suggest that we simply try to conduct the trial in a manner
    that accords with law and fairness. </p>

    exchanges between prosecution counsel and the trial judge:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[OSC Prosecutor]: … I haven't
    resiled from anything and I take fundamental issue with that suggestion. And
    again, if he is going to keep making those submissions, Your Honour is either
    going to have to say, you are right, Mr. Groia, the Crown has done something
    wrong, or Your Honour is going to have to say, there is no purpose in making
    those submissions any longer, Mr. Groia, because they are not accurate.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Court: Well I think the
    question is, if all these documents are authentic and relevant, if that's the
    Crown's position they are all authentic and relevant and Mr. Groia wants to put
    it in, then what else does he have to prove before he can put it in?</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>…</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[OSC Prosecutor]: It's simply not
    right for counsel to be standing up on a constant basis and making accusations
    against the prosecution in that manner. Not appropriate, in my respectful
    submission. If there is something to it, then we should address it. If there is
    nothing to it, then he should be told to stop making those submissions.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Court: I'll ask you the
    question. If the documents there are relevant and authentic ---</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[OSC Prosecutor]: They are not
    admissible. That doesn't make them admissible.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>…</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[OSC Prosecutor]: Okay. I am going
    to stop, Your Honour. I am just going to sit there and accept that he is going
    to malign us and to suggest that we are trying to mislead you. I was quite
    happy to put all of the trading of everyone involved in this company before
    Your Honour. And again, this is where we are headed. If we are going to be
    maligned in this way, I am not going to sit here and let my friend do that
    without taking fundamental objection to those submissions.</p>

    should raise the issue of prosecutorial misconduct in the future. The trial
    judge stated:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Court: Maybe the way we can
    handle this. I don't have an application before me and Mr. Groia says he is not
    applying now for me to make any ruling and that I don't even have the
    evidentiary basis to do it and that at the end of the day he may never make the
    application. But if he has -- Mr. Groia, perhaps if you think that we have come
    to a point where the Crown has done something which at the end of the day will
    be part of your argument to me that there has been prosecutorial misconduct <u>you
    can just say here is another instance, Your Honour, and follow with one line
    and leave it at that. And you can stand up and you can say you object</u><em>.</em> But if --- </p>

    all the records. I am not being asked to resolve this at this time. Really I
    don’t think I should be hearing these arguments because there is a lot of
    repetition in the arguments that I am hearing. <u>So I think we could narrow
    them down to just the way Mr. Groia would stand up when you were putting in a

    doesn't have anything to do with the document ---</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Court: <u>Look, you have your

    Court. I take fundamental objection to those submissions being made, those
    suggestions being made. He also during the course of his submissions alluded to
    the suggestion that the Court cannot rely on what the Crown has said and I
    guess this is an allusion to having reneged on something. And once again I

    effort to move the trial along by directing defence counsel to make a “standard
    complaint” as the basis for the admissibility of a document broke down as soon
    as it was used. On Day 61, Mr. Groia invoked the “standard complaint” for the
    first time in respect of a document. The prosecution was not content with that
    approach, and again objected to the trial judge:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[OSC Prosecutor]: I also wanted to
    indicate again that to the extent that my friend's suggestion regarding the
    standard objection, the standard complaint as he describes it, is an allegation
    of prosecutorial misconduct and I ask that Your Honour rule upon that if he is

    the trial judge modified his approach, giving the following directions:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Court: I am not asking for any

    bring this application at the end of the day and you have put Mr. Naster on
    notice. <u>So unless there is a factual distinction between what your complaint
    is now and there may be some other basis for that complaint that you want to
    put us on notice on, it may be that we don't need to hear it. </u></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Mr. Groia: That was a proposal I

    counsel immediately apologized. During the course of his ruling, the trial
    judge summarized how he had tried to manage the defence’s allegations of
    prosecutorial misconduct in respect of the documents:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As conceded by the defence, there
    was no evidentiary basis for me to make findings of prosecutorial misconduct, <u>and

    ignore the prosecution’s complaints that Mr. Groia was making improper and
    unfounded allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. In its reasons the Appeal
    Panel stated, at para. 86: “<span style='background:white'>At various points,
    [the OSC prosecutor] objected and asked for a ruling on the question of
    prosecutorial misconduct. Justice Hryn repeatedly declined to deal with that
    issue and instead attempted to address the admissibility issues.”</span> With
    respect, that is not a fair statement of the matter. True, the trial judge did
    not accede to the prosecution’s request that he rule on the defence’s abuse of
    process allegations at that time; he deferred that issue until later in the
    trial. Instead, the trial judge adopted a different trial management technique,
    issuing a series of rulings directing how the defence could place those
    allegations before the court. </span></p>

    trial judge’s direction on Day 61 that since Mr. Groia had put the prosecution
    and the court on notice about his intention to bring an abuse of process
    application, “</span><span style='line-height:200%'>unless there is a factual
    distinction between what your complaint is now and there may be some other
    basis for that complaint that you want to put us on notice on, it may be that
    we don’t need to hear it.” </span><span style='line-height:200%'>On Day 65, the
    trial judge stopped Mr. Groia when he started to revisit the allegation,
    stating: “I don’t want to hear that argument.” In his Day 68 ruling, the trial
    judge reminded the parties that he had </span><span style='line-height:200%'>“asked
    the defence to restrict their allegations.” In sum, the trial judge did deal
    with the prosecution’s complaints about Mr. Groia’s allegations, but in his own

    in </span><em>Felderhof</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, at paras. 77, 85
    and 90:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='background:white'>[The

    certain documents. He was not wrong to attempt to move the case along, pending
    the abuse of process and omnibus document motions, by attempting to have
    counsel provide lists of documents that they wish to tender to upcoming witnesses.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='background:white'>…</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='background:white'>The
    application judge has catalogued the attempts that the trial judge did make to
    keep the trial and defence counsel on track. <u>The prosecution says he did not
    do enough but I think it difficult at this stage to second-guess a trial judge

  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='background:white'>…</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='background:white'>I
    agree with the application judge that this is not a case where a trial judge
    did nothing. The trial judge did intervene on several occasions to attempt to
    limit the nature of defence counsel's complaints. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    defence counsel ignored directions given by the trial judge. Quite the
    contrary. The trial record shows that Mr. Groia complied with the trial judge’s
    directions. This is a most material fact in the professional misconduct
    analysis.</span></p>

    Felderhof trial was not a case in which the trial judge was unaware of the need

    response to the </span><span style='line-height:200%'>prosecution’s request for

    reminded counsel to refrain from using sarcasm. On Day 58, during the course of
    submissions by the prosecution, the trial judge stated:</span></p>

    para. 280, that the making of incorrect legal submissions by a barrister
    cannot, in and of itself, constitute a basis for finding professional
    misconduct. The Appeal Panel concluded, however, that it was improper for Mr.
    Groia to use incorrect legal submissions as a “platform” to attack the
    prosecutors and impugn their integrity without a reasonable basis to do so. It
    found that Mr. Groia made allegations of deliberate prosecutorial misconduct
    that were unfounded and lacked a reasonable basis: at paras. 295 and 328. The
    Appeal Panel stated that during the course of making those allegations Mr.
    Groia impugned the integrity of prosecutors without any factual foundation,
    including by alleging that they could not be relied on to keep their word, were
    lazy and were incompetent: at para. 285.</span></p>

    the Appeal Panel, with one exception. Having reviewed the transcripts from Day
    52 to Day 70, I do not understand how the Appeal Panel could conclude, at para.
    286, that Mr. Groia’s use of the term “Government” to describe the prosecution
    and the prosecutors amounted to the use of sarcasm to cast aspersions on
    opposing counsel. Mr. Groia did not resort to the term “Government” only
    occasionally; it was his term of choice for describing the prosecution. The
    trial judge once admonished the OSC prosecutor for the use of sarcasm, but Mr.
    Groia’s use of “Government” drew no admonition from the trial judge. Nor did it
    draw any objection from the prosecution. Moreover, the term “Government”
    accurately describes the status of the OSC as prosecutor. I think the Appeal
    Panel’s conclusion on the use of the word “Government” illustrates the
    difficulties and dangers of after-the-fact transcript reviews of a barrister’s
    in-court conduct. In any event, this is a minor point.</span></p>

    with those conclusions of the Appeal Panel lies in the reasons of this court in</span><em> Felderhof</em><span style='line-height:200%'>. A distinctive feature of this
    case is that partway through the trial, the prosecution sought relief from more
    senior courts to stop the trial and replace the trial judge, in part because of
    how the trial judge was responding to Mr. Groia’s conduct. Although the
    prosecution did not obtain a new trial, it did secure comments from this court
    about what had transpired to that point in the trial, as well as directions
    about how the trial should move forward.</span></p>

    assessing whether Mr. Groia’s in-court conduct amounted to professional
    misconduct. The comments did not amount to “findings of fact” made against Mr.
    Groia which might preclude or in some way limit his ability to defend a charge
    of professional misconduct. However, this court’s comments identified conduct
    that Mr. Groia should not continue during the balance of the trial. In effect,
    this court told Mr. Groia to “cut it out” and change his ways; he did. As well,
    this court gave specific directions to the trial judge about how to manage

    office imposes on the presiding judge a duty not only to keep his or her
    emotions in check during a hearing, but also those of the participants,
    especially counsel. Charged as they are with the task of fearlessly defending

    at para. 83. These words are true and wise. But, courtrooms are not populated
    by saints; they are populated by flawed human beings who enter them each day to
    argue and adjudicate cases. As put by the intervener, The Advocates’ Society,
    “advocates are not infallible and may occasionally falter.” The same can be
    said about judges. To hold either counsel or judges to a standard of perfection

    zealous advocacy from impermissible courtroom conduct. No person stands in a
    better position than the presiding judge to assess what a barrister says or

    six trial days, the trial judge went from the position that he would not

    standard form of complaint, Mr. Groia complied. When Mr. Groia first employed
    the standard complaint – eliciting a prosecution objection in response – he
    agreed to comply with the trial judge’s further direction that since defence
    counsel already had given sufficient notice of his allegation, it need not be
    repeated unless there was some other basis for the complaint. When, on Day 65,
    Mr. Groia began to backslide into making an allegation of prosecutorial
    misconduct, the trial judge cut him off, stating he did not need to hear that

    to take into account the entirety of the member’s conduct, not just what
    happened at a particular slice of time. A barrister who persists in improper

    not expressly include a similar factor in its analysis, the Divisional Court

    Panel committed two errors in this area of its analysis. First, the Appeal

    In </span><em>Felderhof</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, this court found

    the prosecution’s objections to the defence’s abuse of process allegations; the

    Court erred in accepting, at para. 96, the Appeal Panel’s conclusion that Mr.

    impermissible second-guessing on the part of the Appeal Panel and the
    Divisional Court to disregard this court’s findings on the issue of trial

    Appeal Panel’s finding, at para. 351, that Mr. Groia’s conduct caused “a
    serious adverse impact” to the prosecution’s first witness, Mr. Francisco. The
    trial record discloses that the prosecution’s examination-in-chief of Mr.
    Francisco consumed 20 days of trial time. By the time Phase One adjourned, the
    defence’s cross-examination of Mr. Francisco had taken about 10 days. No rule
    of criminal or civil procedure establishes some limit in the ratio between the
    times for cross-examination and examination-in-chief beyond which counsel
    cannot tread without fear of sanction for professional misconduct. If the
    Appeal Panel intended to signal that when defence counsel’s cross-examination
    of a witness exceeds 50% of the length of the prosecution’s
    examination-in-chief counsel then is straying into the area of professional
    misconduct, that bright line is transgressed every week in the civil and
    criminal trial courts of this province. With respect, I think the Appeal
    Panel’s finding on this point was incorrect and unreasonable.</span></p>

    trial judge to ensure that witnesses are treated fairly. The transcripts of the
    trial disclose that the trial judge was alive to the need to ensure that Mr.
    Francisco was treated fairly by both counsel. From Day 52 to Day 68, the record
    shows that the trial judge was faced with opposing counsel who were incapable
    of making brief submissions on any point. His frustration with both counsel was
    palpable on the face of the transcripts. His frustration was based, in part,
    upon the effect that the incessant bickering by <u>both</u> counsel was having
    on the progress of the evidence. Ultimately, the trial judge made rulings which
    foreclosed further submissions on certain points by both counsel and required
    them to focus on calling evidence.</span></p>

    Mr. Groia to stop making allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Mr. Groia
    complied with the trial judge’s rulings. This court then gave strong directions
    to both the trial judge and Mr. Groia about how to deal with the disputed

    the Law Society Tribunal, consisting of the Law Society Hearing and Appeal
    Divisions: <em>Modernizing Regulation of the Legal Profession Act, 2013</em><em><span

    Professional Conduct</em>, modelled on the Federation of Law Societies of
    Canada’s <em>Model Code of Professional Conduct</em>.  Because the current
    rules, which are virtually identical in material part to the relevant 2000
    Rules, post-date Mr. Groia’s impugned conduct, they are inapplicable in this
    case.</p>

    oversight regulators, has clear statutory authority to proceed in this
    fashion.  Once the Law Society receives information that suggests a lawyer has
    engaged in professional misconduct, it can start an investigation.  The
    information need not come in the form of a third-party complaint: see s. 49.3
    of the Act.</p>

    Appeal Panel misunderstood his position on the appropriate test and that he did
    not agree that the test described by the Appeal Panel was conclusive, one way
    or the other, on the matter of professional misconduct.</p>

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> As the evidence relevant to those acts of professional misconduct was the same
    as that relied on by the Law Society for its misconduct allegations regarding
    Mr. Groia’s communications with the court, the Appeal Panel ruled that it was
    unnecessary to address the latter allegations.  This ruling is not challenged
    on appeal.</p>
