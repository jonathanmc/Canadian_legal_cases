  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Special rules govern discharge hearings in
    income tax-driven personal bankruptcies. Section 172.1 of the <em>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “<em>BIA</em>”), provides
    that where the bankrupt has $200,000 or more of personal income tax debt and
    that personal income tax debt represents 75% or more of the bankrupt’s total
    unsecured proven claims, the timing of the discharge hearing, the discharge
    orders available to the court to make, and the factors the court must take into
    account in deciding the discharge application differ from those applied in a standard
    bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the time of his discharge hearing, the
    respondent bankrupt, Paul Schnier, had unpaid income tax assessments totaling
    approximately $4.478 million. About $4.424 million of that amount was subject
    to outstanding appeals he had filed in the Tax Court of Canada. If the full
    assessed amount was considered part of his personal income tax debt, s. 172.1
    of the </span><em>BIA</em><span lang=EN-US> would apply to his bankruptcy; if
    the appealed amounts were excluded, s. 172.1 would not apply.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The Registrar in Bankruptcy held that s. 172.1
    of the <em>BIA</em> did not apply to Mr. Schnier’s application for discharge.
    Her order of July 18, 2014 (the “Discharge Order”) discharged Mr. Schnier,
    subject to the condition that he remit to the trustee the remaining surplus
    income payable, up to a maximum of $10,000. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By order dated December 8, 2014 (the “Appeal
    Order”), the motion judge dismissed the Attorney General’s motion by way of
    appeal from the Discharge Order. The Attorney General now appeals to this court.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the Attorney General asks that the
    Appeal Order be set aside, if it is, the Attorney General does not seek to vary
    the conditions of the Discharge Order made by the Registrar. The relief sought
    by the Attorney General on this appeal is limited to a determination that s.
    172.1 of the <em>BIA</em> applied to Mr. Schnier’s discharge hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue, then, on this appeal is a narrow one:
    In calculating Mr. Schnier’s personal income tax debt under <em>BIA</em> s.
    172.1(1), should the assessed amounts of personal income tax that were under
    appeal at the time of his discharge hearing be included?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons set out below, I conclude the
    answer is “no”, and I would dismiss the appeal. Both the motion judge and the
    Registrar correctly concluded that until the Tax Court of Canada had disposed
    of Mr. Schnier’s appeals of the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) assessments, the
    portion of the CRA’s claim for the assessed amounts under appeal was a
    contingent one that the trustee could refuse to admit as a proven claim.
    Accordingly, the motion judge and the Registrar correctly held that s. 172.1 of
    the <em>BIA</em> did not apply to Mr. Schnier’s discharge hearing. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Schnier is a tax lawyer. His bankruptcy was
    driven by investments he made in two types of tax shelters. Between 1985 and
    1991, Mr. Schnier invested in two yacht tax shelters. In the 1990s and early
    2000s, he invested in four computer software tax shelters. Mr. Schnier claimed
    deductions from his income on those investments for either interest expenses or
    business losses. At the time Mr. Schnier made these investments, he believed
    that the tax shelters were permitted under the <em>Income Tax Act </em></span>(“<em><span
lang=EN-US>ITA</span></em>”)<span lang=EN-US>; he had made the investments
    after receiving opinions from independent tax lawyers and accountants.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Beginning in 1989, Mr. Schnier received notices
    of reassessment in relation to the yacht tax shelters going back to the 1985
    taxation year. He immediately served on the Minister of National Revenue
    notices of objection to all of the CRA reassessments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 165(3) of the <em>ITA</em> provides that
    upon receipt of a notice of objection, the Minister “shall, with all due
    dispatch, reconsider the assessment and vacate, confirm or vary the assessment
    or reassess”. That did not occur in this case. Inexplicably, the Minister
    allowed Mr. Schnier’s objections to languish for over two decades. During that
    time, Mr. Schnier repeatedly asked the CRA to deal with his file, to no avail. It
    was not until October 2011 that the Minister confirmed the reassessments for
    the yacht tax shelters. Mr. Schnier promptly filed notices of appeal to the Tax
    Court of Canada in November 2011.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The following month, Mr. Schnier made a proposal
    to his creditors under the <em>BIA</em>. At that time, he had been assessed
    $1,278,519.62 in income tax, plus penalties and interest, for a total of
    $4,478,703.19. Although Mr. Schnier increased the amount of his proposal to
    creditors over the course of the following creditors’ meetings, the CRA
    rejected the proposal, resulting in his deemed assignment into bankruptcy on
    January 19, 2012. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 1, 2012, the CRA filed a proof of
    claim in the bankruptcy in the amount of $4,478,703.19 (the “Claim”). The CRA
    disclosed that of the amount claimed, $4,424,558.19 was under appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January 2013, the Minister confirmed the
    assessments for the computer software tax shelters. Mr. Schnier filed appeals
    from those assessments in April 2013.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its February 4, 2014 Report on the Bankrupt’s
    Application for Discharge, the trustee noted that the Tax Court had not yet
    determined Mr. Schnier’s appeals of the CRA assessments. As a result, the
    trustee reported that it was “unable to value the claim and has not admitted
    CRA’s claim for the assessed amounts under appeal as it is contingent.”  Consequently,
    the trustee’s July 9, 2014 Claims Register admitted only $71,170.40 of the
    Claim, and recorded the remaining $4.424 million of the Claim as a contingent
    claim which was not admitted by the trustee. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The CRA opposed Mr. Schnier’s application to be
    discharged from bankruptcy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Registrar was required to consider whether
    the rules governing tax-driven personal bankruptcies set out in <em>BIA</em> s.
    172.1 applied to Mr. Schnier’s bankruptcy. The reason is that important
    differences exist in the discharge procedures for individual bankrupts who fall
    within s. 172.1 and those who do not:</span></p>

    circumstances of the bankrupt at the time the personal income tax debt was

    tax debt; whether the bankrupt made payments in respect of other debts while

    bankrupt’s financial prospects.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her July 18, 2014 reasons, the Registrar considered
    that the CRA was a proven creditor to the extent of the claims admitted by the
    trustee – about $71,170.  The balance of the CRA’s claim consisted of assessed
    amounts of tax that were subject to appeals pending in the Tax Court of Canada
    and constituted a contingent claim.  The Registrar concluded that “at present,
    the CRA has a contingent liability that cannot support the applicability of s.
    172.1 of the <em>BIA</em>.” On appeal, the motion judge agreed with the
    Registrar.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>ISSUE ON THE APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At issue on this appeal is whether s. 172.1(1)
    of the <em>BIA</em></span> applied to Mr. Schnier’s discharge hearing.  The
    section <span lang=EN-US>provides that the special income tax-driven bankruptcy
    discharge rules apply “[i]n </span><span lang=EN>the case of a bankrupt who has
    $200,000 or more of personal income tax debt and whose personal income tax debt
    represents 75% or more of the bankrupt’s total unsecured proven claims”.</span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties offer competing interpretations of
    what constitutes “personal income tax debt” for purposes of s. 172.1. The
    Attorney General argues that “personal income tax debt” includes unpaid
    assessed tax, notwithstanding any right the taxpayer has to file an objection
    or appeal. The Attorney General submits that in this case, all of the $4.4
    million CRA claimed in its proof of claim were amounts payable as of the dates
    of assessment, and remained payable under the </span><em>ITA </em><span
lang=EN-US>notwithstanding Mr. Schnier’s subsequent appeals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Attorney General submits that its

lang=EN-US>provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>158. Where the Minister mails a
    notice of assessment of any amount payable by a taxpayer, that part of the

    Attorney General, when combined together these two characteristics of an unpaid
    assessed personal income tax debt are determinative of the analysis in this
    appeal. Even if a taxpayer appeals an assessment, the character of the tax debt
    remains one that is “payable forthwith” (s. 158) and “valid and binding” (s.
    152(8)): in effect, a liquidated claim. As a result, the Attorney General
    submits, “personal income tax debt” within the meaning of <em>BIA</em> s.

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Usually, where an amount is payable under the <em>ITA</em>,
    s. 223(2) authorizes the Minister to certify an amount payable that has not

    payable under <em>ITA</em> s. 223(2) can be registered in the Federal Court
    and, when registered, has the same effect as if the certificate were a judgment
    obtained in the Federal Court against the tax debtor. Sections 223 through 225
    then describe the different enforcement steps available to the Minister to
    collect the amount payable: commencing legal proceedings in court; certifying
    the amount due under s. 223; using statutory garnishment remedies; and seizing

    enforcement steps until 90 days after the Minister has sent his notice of
    confirmation to the taxpayer (s. 225.1(2)). Similarly, if a taxpayer has
    appealed from an assessment to the Tax Court of Canada, the Minister cannot

    narrow an approach to what constitutes an “amount payable” under </span><em>ITA</em><span
lang=EN-US> s. 223(1), and therefore “personal income tax debt” in </span><em>BIA</em><span
lang=EN-US> s. 172.1.  The Attorney General’s submission focuses on only some
    of the characteristics of an assessed income tax debt – “payable forthwith” and
    “valid and binding notwithstanding any error, defect, or omission”. It ignores
    the critical effect of sections 152(8), 225.1 and 248(2) of the </span><em>ITA</em><span
lang=EN-US> that enable a taxpayer to appeal an assessment and limit the
    collectability of that tax debt by the Minister until the courts dispose of the
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the provisions of the </span><em>ITA</em><span
lang=EN-US> are considered as a whole, the meaning of “amount payable” as used
    in <em>ITA</em> s. 223(1) and <em>BIA</em> s. 172.1(8), must take into account
    that where a taxpayer has appealed an assessment to the Tax Court of Canada,
    the actual amount of tax that the Minister can compel the taxpayer to pay will
    not be known until the occurrence of a future event – i.e. the determination of
    the taxpayer’s appeal from the assessment. This is a hallmark of a contingent
    claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, a creditor’s inability to enforce a
    claim bears directly on the creditor’s ability to prove its claim under the <em>BIA.</em> In order to be a provable claim within the meaning of <em>BIA</em> s. 121, a
    claim must be one recoverable by legal process: <em>Re Central Capital Corp.</em> (1996), 27 O.R. (3d) 494 (C.A.), at pp. 532-533. The restraints placed by </span><em>ITA</em><span
lang=EN-US> s. 225.1 on the enforceability of an assessed amount of tax that is
    under appeal are strong indicators that a claim based on those amounts would
    not be provable in a bankruptcy.</span></p>

    assessed against an individual bankrupt taxpayer remain under appeal at the

    unprovable one.</span></p>

    (C.A.); and (ii) the British Columbia and Quebec courts were wrong to conclude in </span><em>Re </em><em><span lang=EN-US>Port Chevrolet</span></em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The Attorney General submits that <em>Re Norris</em> stands for the principle that in carrying out its duties under the <em>BIA</em>,
    a trustee cannot ignore what Parliament has legislated with respect to tax
    debts. Applying that principle to the present case, the Attorney General argues
    that the trustee must give full recognition to assessed amounts under appeal
    because under the <em>ITA</em> a taxpayer becomes liable for an unpaid portion
    of an assessment when the notice of assessment is sent. That liability
    continues to exist until the assessment is varied or vacated on an objection or
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the principle in <em>Re Norris</em> does not extend as far as the Attorney General submits. That case involved the
    bankruptcy of an individual against whom an assessment had been issued under
    the <em>ITA</em>. Critically, unlike in the present case, the bankrupt had not
    filed a notice of objection to the assessment. The Crown filed a proof of claim
    in the bankruptcy for the assessed amount and provided the trustee with the
    notice of assessment. The trustee disallowed the claim. This court held, at p.
    287, that the trustee’s request for evidence to support the proof of claim was
    fully answered by the notice of assessment, and if the trustee in bankruptcy
    wished to question the validity of an assessment against the bankrupt, it was
    required to seek its remedy within the <em>ITA</em> by filing a notice of

    behind the notice of assessment in order to ascertain the amount of Mr.
    Schnier’s personal income tax debt. Instead, the trustee gave effect to the
    appeal and enforcement provisions of the <em>ITA</em>. Whether the tax debt was
    liquidated or contingent for purposes of the <em>BIA</em> depended upon whether
    the taxpayer had exercised the appeal rights granted by the <em>ITA</em> and,
    if he had, whether s. 225.1 of the <em>ITA</em> restrained the Minister from
    taking steps to enforce and collect the assessed amount. The trustee took into
    account that no final determination of Mr. Schnier’s appeal had been made under
    the <em>ITA</em>, with the result that it was unable to value the CRA’s claim. </span></p>

    (“CCRA”) had issued an assessment under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em></span>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15,<span lang=EN-US> to Port Chevrolet for about $16.4
    million. The company filed a notice of intention to make a proposal under the <em>BIA</em>.
    The company also filed a notice of objection to the assessment. The CCRA filed
    a proof of claim in the amount of about $15.8 million the day before the
    meeting of creditors to vote on the company’s proposal. The trustee disallowed
    CCRA’s claim and valued it at nil, taking the view that it was unproven because
    it was based on an unresolved appeal and notice of objection. Relying on the
    trustee’s disallowance, the chair of the creditors’ meeting concluded that the
    CCRA claim was contingent and valued it at nil for voting purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The CCRA appealed the trustee’s disallowance of
    its claim and the chair’s decision that it had no right to vote at the meeting.
    The chambers judge dismissed the appeal on two grounds. First, the CCRA had
    failed to file a proof of claim in proper form: at para. 25. Second, the court
    rejected the CCRA’s argument that provisions in the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> analogous to ss. 152(8) and 158 of the <em>ITA</em> created a valid and binding
    debt due from the moment of assessment regardless of the pending objection and
    appeal process: at paras. 35-36. The court stated, at para. 43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[I]</span>f CCRA wishes to participate in
    concurrent proceedings under the&nbsp;<i><span

    with respect to proving its claim, and that compliance includes recognition of
    the trustee's powers to determine a claim is contingent and value it
    accordingly. I do not read&nbsp;<em>Re Norris</em>&nbsp;as precluding a trustee

lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The British Columbia Court of Appeal affirmed
    the decision, but only in respect of the finding that the CCRA had failed to

lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A similar issue arose in a Quebec case involving
    a proposal made by 2713250 Canada Inc. under the <em>BIA</em>. The Agence du
    revenue du Québec (“ARQ”) had issued two notices of assessment to the debtor
    company for which the company had filed notices of objection. The ARQ filed
    proofs of claim in the proposal proceedings based upon the full amount of the
    assessments. At two meetings of creditors, the proposal trustee held that the
    ARQ’s claims were contingent and impossible to value because of the pending
    appeal of the notices of assessment. Therefore, the ARQ was ineligible to vote.
    The ARQ appealed the trustee’s decisions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Gascon J., as he then was, dismissed the appeal,
    applying the reasoning of the chambers judge in the </span><em>Re </em><em><span
lang=EN-US>Port Chevrolet</span></em><span lang=EN-US> case. He held that in
    exercising the power conferred on it by <em>BIA</em> s. 108(1), the trustee
    could conclude that the ARQ’s claims were in fact contingent, unliquidated, and
    not provable claims, due to the impossibility of valuing them with any
    certainty: at para. 86. Gascon J. then considered, and rejected, the ARQ’s
    argument about the validity and binding nature of its notices of assessment, at
    paras. 88 through 94:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Contrary to what the ARQ argues, the Court
    believes that in exercising the power ascribed to it by section 108(1), the
    Trustee was not legally bound to consider as valid, regardless of the
    situation, the notices of assessment on which the disputed proofs of claims are
    based.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>On the one hand, if the relevant tax laws
    establish a presumption of validity of those notices of assessment, that
    presumption is not irrebuttable. The objection process such tax laws authorize
    surely demonstrates this.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, the presumptions of
    validity established by tax laws are not incompatible with the exercise of the
    jurisdiction which the <em>BIA</em> confers on the Trustee pursuant to sections
    108, 121 or 135 of the BIA.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>As the Court of Appeal for British Columbia
    points out in its analysis of the problem in <em>Port Chevrolet</em>, there are
    two possible solutions under such circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The first is that in terms of a proof of claim
    filed under the <em>BIA</em>, one must give, without reservation, full faith
    and credit to any notice of assessment by the tax authorities, regardless
    whether it may eventually be set aside.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The second is that we can reconcile the </span><em>BIA</em><span
lang=EN-US> and tax laws by drawing a distinction between, on the one hand,
    business judgment and a trustee’s practice in exercising its powers under the <em>BIA </em>and, on the other hand, the “rebuttable” presumptions of validity of tax
    laws which subsist notwithstanding the prescribed objection and appeal processes.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>For its part, the Court prefers the second
    solution, which is much more respectful of the objectives of the </span><em>BIA</em><span
lang=EN-US>. [Translation from French.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the </span><em>Re </em><em><span
lang=EN-US>Port Chevrolet</span></em><span lang=EN-US> and </span><em>Re </em><em><span
lang=EN-US>2713250 Canada</span></em><span lang=EN-US> </span><em>Inc</em><span
lang=EN-US>. cases both involved the exercise by trustees of their discretion
    in the context of admitting or rejecting proofs of claim for the purposes of
    voting under <em>BIA</em> s. 108(1), in my view the reasoning in </span><em>Re </em><em><span
lang=EN-US>Port Chevrolet</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, as adopted by </span><em>Re </em><em><span lang=EN-US>2713250 Canada Inc.</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, applies
    equally to the exercise of the trustee’s general power to determine whether a
    contingent claim is a provable claim under ss. 121 and 135 of the </span><em>BIA</em><span
lang=EN-US>. Where a bankrupt taxpayer has appealed assessed amounts of income
    tax, it is open to a trustee to characterize a CRA proof of claim based on
    those assessments as a contingent claim. If the claim cannot be valued with any
    certainty prior to the disposition of the appeal, the trustee may treat the
    contingent claim as not provable in the bankruptcy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Such a result gives full recognition to the provisions of the </span><em>ITA</em><span
lang=EN-US> discussed earlier dealing with the calculation and enforcement of
    assessed amounts of income tax, while treating a proof of claim based on an
    appealed assessment in a manner harmonious with the general scheme of the <em>BIA</em> concerning creditors’ proofs of claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Such an interpretation is also consistent with the language of s.
    172.1(1) of the <em>BIA</em></span>,<span lang=EN-US> which provides that the
    special discharge rules for tax-driven personal bankruptcies apply “in </span><span
lang=EN>the case of a bankrupt who has $200,000 or more of personal income tax
    debt and whose personal income tax debt </span><span class=Underline>represents</span><span
lang=EN> 75% or more of the bankrupt’s total unsecured proven claims” (emphasis
    added). The use of the word “represents” signifies that in order for “personal
    income tax debt” to be capable of representing 75% of a bankrupt’s unsecured
    “proven claims”, the “personal income tax debt” must possess the
    characteristics of a provable claim in bankruptcy. Put another way, to qualify
    as “personal income tax debt” within the meaning of s. 172.1(1), the tax debt
    must be a proven claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To hold otherwise would give unfair,
    preferential treatment to CRA proofs of claim based on assessed income tax
    amounts that remain under appeal at the time of a discharge hearing. If the
    full amount of the assessed amount under appeal was recognized as a claim
    provable in the bankruptcy, and the taxpayer’s appeal of the assessment was
    later allowed and the assessed amount reduced or eliminated, the CRA would have
    obtained an unjustified advantage over other creditors in the bankruptcy
    proceeding.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Against that conclusion, the Attorney General
    argues that to treat CRA claims for unpaid assessed income tax under appeal as
    contingent ones that may not be provable would render meaningless s. 172.1 of
    the </span><em>BIA</em><span lang=EN-US>. A taxpayer who was subject to
    significant income tax assessments could abuse the bankruptcy process by
    appealing his assessment, then make an assignment in bankruptcy and fail to
    expedite the hearing of his tax appeal. That would allow a bankrupt to avoid
    the special discharge rules created by s. 172.1 for tax-driven bankruptcies. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge correctly addressed
    this argument when he held that “an adjournment could have been sought before
    the [Registrar] so the appeal could be heard and no attempt was made in this
    case.” Indeed, had the CRA sought a brief adjournment of Mr. Schnier’s
    discharge hearing, no dispute could have arisen about the applicability of s.
    172.1 to his bankruptcy, as the following chronology of events discloses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 225.1(5) of the <em>ITA</em> states that
    where a taxpayer who has appealed to the Tax Court of Canada has agreed to
    delay his appeal until the court has decided related test cases, then the
    Minister may take actions to enforce the assessments against the taxpayer at
    any time after the Minister gives written notice to the taxpayer that the
    decision of the Tax Court of Canada in the test case has been mailed to the
    Minister. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In February 2012, Mr. Schnier had filed with the
    Tax Court of Canada his agreement to be bound in the lead test cases before
    that court concerning the deductibility of expenses relating to the yacht tax
    shelters. The Tax Court of Canada confirmed that it would hold his appeal in
    abeyance pending the resolution of the three lead test cases. The lead cases
    concerning the yacht tax shelters were dismissed on January 7, 2014 and an
    appeal from that dismissal to the Federal Court of Appeal was withdrawn on
    March 19, 2014. Both those events took place before Mr. Schnier’s bankruptcy
    hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, the Tax Court of Canada did not
    formally dismiss Mr. Schnier’s appeal from the yacht tax shelter assessments
    until August 18, 2014, slightly more than a month after his discharge hearing was
    held. The record does not explain when the Tax Court of Canada mailed the
    Minister the decision dismissing the lead test appeals concerning the yacht tax
    shelters or why the Minister did not send a written notice of the decision to
    Mr. Schnier prior to his discharge hearing. From the transcript of the
    discharge hearing, it is apparent that the parties were aware the test cases
    had been resolved in favour of the CRA: Appeal Book, p. 56. Why, given those
    circumstances, the CRA did not ask for a short adjournment of the discharge
    hearing pending formal notice to Mr. Schnier of the dismissal of the lead test
    appeals pursuant to </span><em>ITA </em><span lang=EN-US>s. 225.1(5) was not
    explained in the record before us. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, in her factum, the Attorney General
    argued that the trustee had failed to determine whether or not the CRA’s Claim
    was provable. I disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the appeal record did not contain a
    notice of disallowance issued by the trustee under <em>BIA</em> s. 135(3) in
    respect of the Claim, appellant’s counsel candidly conceded that there was no
    evidence before the court about what, if anything, the trustee did under s.
    135. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, the evidence showed that the CRA
    was aware well before the discharge hearing that the trustee had disallowed
    that part of its Claim covering the assessed amounts under appeal. The
    trustee’s Report under s. 170(1) on the bankrupt’s application for discharge
    was dated February 4, 2014, some five months prior to the discharge hearing,
    and was signed by the inspectors, including one of the inspectors who was an
    employee of the CRA. The Report clearly stated that the trustee was unable to
    value most of the CRA’s Claim and had not admitted the portion concerning the
    assessed amounts under appeal as it was contingent. The Trustee’s July 9, 2014
    Claims Register also recorded that $4.385 million of the CRA Claim had been
    classified as contingent and had not been admitted for dividend. Accordingly,
    the evidence before the Registrar at the time of the discharge hearing was that
    the trustee had determined that only $71,170 of the CRA Claim was provable in
    the bankruptcy.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons set out above, I conclude that
    both the motion judge and the Registrar were correct in concluding that until
    the Tax Court of Canada disposed of Mr. Schnier’s appeals of the CRA’s
    assessments, the CRA’s claim in the bankruptcy for the assessed amount under
    appeal was a contingent one which the trustee could refuse to admit as a proven
    claim. Consequently, the motion judge and the Registrar correctly concluded
    that s. 172.1 of the <em>BIA</em> did not apply to Mr. Schnier’s discharge
    hearing. </span></p>
