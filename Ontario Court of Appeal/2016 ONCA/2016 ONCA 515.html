    proceed in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In November 2011, an Israeli newspaper, Haaretz,
    published an article criticizing the management practices of Mitchell Goldhar, the
    owner of the Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club, a soccer team based in Tel Aviv,
    that plays in the Israeli Premier League. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Goldhar is a prominent Canadian businessman and
    lives in Toronto. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition to being published in print, the
    article was available on the newspapers Hebrew and English-language websites.
    It came to the attention of some Canadian readers through the English-language
    website.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The article asserted that Goldhar imported his
    management model from his main business interest  a partnership with Walmart to
    operate shopping centers in Canada  and that he runs his club down to every
    detail. It also included a suggestion that his managerial culture is based on
    overconcentration bordering on megalomania and questioned whether his penny
    pinching and lack of long term planning [could] doom the [soccer] team. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In December 2011, Goldhar launched an action in
    Ontario, claiming damages for libel against Haaretz, its sports editor and the
    reporter who wrote the article (collectively Haaretz).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Haaretz moved to stay the action, arguing that
    Ontario courts lack jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em> or, alternatively, that
    Israel is a clearly more appropriate forum. In the further alternative, Haaretz
    sought to stay the action as an abuse of process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When Haaretzs motion was heard, Goldhars
    counsel claimed he wishes a jury trial, a mode of trial not available in
    Israel. They also provided oral undertakings not to seek damages at the trial
    of this action for reputational harm suffered in Israel or anywhere else
    outside of Canada and to pay for Haaretzs witnesses to travel to Ontario for
    purposes of the action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge dismissed Haaretzs motion. He found
    that the article came to the attention of many of the 200 people in Goldhars
    Toronto office and that it is likely that 200-300 people in Canada read the
    article online. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Haaretz did not dispute that Ontario readership established
    a tort committed in Ontario  one of the presumptive connecting factors under
    the real and substantial connection test for determining jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em> set out in <em>Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</em>, 2012 SCC 17, [2012] 1
    S.C.R. 572. However, Haaretz argued that, under the second step of the <em>Van
    Breda</em> test, the presumption of jurisdiction was rebutted. The motion judge
    rejected this argument. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the motion judge held that Israel was
    not a clearly more appropriate forum. He weighed the factors raised by Haaretz
    and concluded that convenience and expense to the parties</span> favours<span
lang=EN-US> Israel, and that convenience and expense to witnesses slightly</span> favours<span lang=EN-US> Israel. However, he found that choice of law, loss of
    juridical advantage, and fairness to the parties favour Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the motion judge rejected Haaretzs
    claim that the action is an abuse of process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the result, the motion judge dismissed
    Haaretzs motion but directed that, if the action proceeds in Ontario, Goldhars
    claim is limited to damages for reputational harm suffered in Canada and that Goldhar
    shall pay for the travel and accommodation expenses for Haaretzs witnesses at
    the rates provided in the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194<i>.</i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Haaretz raises three main issues on appeal:</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, if Ontario has jurisdiction, did the motion judge err
    in failing to find that Israel is a clearly more appropriate forum and, in
    particular, did he err in his findings concerning convenience and expense to witnesses,

  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The Article</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Haaretz is Israels oldest daily newspaper  but
    also has the smallest circulation of the five daily Hebrew-language newspapers
    in Israel, with a market share of about seven per cent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The article was published in print in Israel, with
    a distribution of about 70,000 copies. While print copies were also distributed
    outside of Israel, no print copies were distributed in Canada. However, the
    article was posted online  in Hebrew on Haaretz.co.il and in English on
    Haaretz.com  and thus was available via the internet in Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    of these reasons. I set out below the portions of the article the motion judge
    reproduced in the body of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Though he spends most of his time in Canada, Maccabi Tel Aviv
    owner Mitch Goldhar runs his club down to every detail. But could his penny
    pinching and lack of long term planning doom the team.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crises are par for the course at Maccabi Tel Aviv, even when
    the club appears to be on an even keel. Most of the crises dont make it onto
    the publics radar, but they have one thing in common: their connection to the way
    that Canadian owner Mitch Goldhar runs the club.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mitchs game plan is to wear down anybody who he wants to get
    rid of, until theyve had enough and decide to leave of their own accord, one
    club insider told Haaretz this week.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Goldhars management model was imported directly from his main
    business interest - a partnership with Wal-Mart to operate shopping centers in
    Canada. He even spelled out his managerial vision in a leaflet distributed to
    fans ahead of Sunday nights derby against Hapoel Tel Aviv.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>By dealing with disciplinary matters, commitment and the right
    approach, he wrote, we are now at the dawn of a cultural revolution - a process
    of building a new sporting culture.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Within the club, however, there are those who believe that
    Goldhars managerial culture is based on overconcentration bordering on
    megalomania, penny-pinching and a lack of long-term planning.</p>

    claims both general and punitive damages against Haaretz for libel. He alleges that
    the article was published in Hebrew and in English on the internet and
    distributed throughout Ontario and Canada, as well as internationally.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Among other things, Goldhar pleads that the

    tort where only a relatively minor element of the tort has occurred in the

    connecting factor would point only to a weak relationship between the forum

    absence of the substantial publication  in Ontario was not viewed as rebutting
    the presumption that the chosen forum has a real and substantial connection

    evidence of harm to Goldhars reputation in Ontario, the motion judge said, at
    para. 25, that proof of harm to reputation is not an element of the tort of
    defamation and thus is an irrelevant consideration for purposes of
    determining whether a minor element of the tort occurred in Ontario. The
    motion judge added that even if proof of harm to reputation was relevant to
    determining whether a minor element of the tort occurred in Ontario, Haaretz

    number of readers. Far more people read the article in Israel. Significantly,
    the subject matter of the article  the soccer team  is located in Israel. And,
    the people involved in and affected by the article are located in Israel.
    Moreover, Goldhar is a prominent figure in Israel  and that is where he would
    have suffered reputational harm. </span></p>

    the subject matter of the litigation was connected to Ontario because the book

    relying on the fact that the presumption of harm to Goldhars reputation in
    Ontario had not been rebutted, because damage sustained in the jurisdiction is
    not a presumptive connecting factor that must be rebutted. In any event, Haaretz
    argues that it was unreasonable to require it to demonstrate that Goldhar had

    matter of the article is not confined to a discussion of Goldhars business
    dealings in Israel or of the operation of Maccabi Tel Aviv. Rather, the article
    puts Goldhars Canadian connection front and center by acknowledging that he is
    a long distance operator and spends most of his time in Canada and by asserting
    that he imported his management model for Maccabi Tel Aviv from his <em>main</em> business interest, his Canadian shopping center partnership.</span></p>

    that he displays characteristics of a mental disorder, makes irrational
    business decisions, treats employees in an offensive manner, and is
    irrationally thrifty concerning benefits to employees. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What is important is that the alleged sting of
    the article is very much related to how Goldhar conducts business in Canada
    because the article draws a link between Goldhars management model and his
    Canadian business. Although the main subject of the article may be the
    management of an Israeli soccer team, the article makes Goldhars management
    model  and its Canadian origins  an integral part of that subject. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is not a case of libel tourism. On the
    motion judges findings, Goldhar lives in Ontario and has operated a business
    here for at least 17 years. Moreover, the subject matter of the litigation is
    connected to Ontario largely because of the link drawn between the article and
    Goldhars Canadian business. As the motion judge observed when addressing <em>forum
    non conveniens</em>, it should not have come as a surprise to Haaretz that Goldhar
    would seek to vindicate his reputation here. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, I do not accept Haaretzs claim that the
    connection between the tort and Ontario is weak because the article was
    published more extensively in Israel. At the rebuttal stage of the jurisdiction <em>simpliciter </em>analysis, the question is whether, objectively speaking,
    Ontario has a real and substantial connection to the subject matter of the
    action, not whether there is another forum that could also take jurisdiction
    over the action. See, for example, <em>Muscutt v. Courcelles</em> (2002), 60
    O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.), at p. 36, where Sharpe J.A. observed, the real and

    statements that, in a defamation action, damage is presumed and that Haaretz
    did not adduce evidence to rebut that presumption. In making these statements,
    the motion judge was not suggesting that damage is a presumptive connecting
    factor. Rather, he was responding to Haaretzs argument that the fact that Goldhar
    had adduced no evidence of harm in Ontario supported its position that only a
    minor element of the tort was committed in Ontario. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge rejected this argument. In

    in <em>Van Breda</em>, at para. 109, and the factors Haaretz relied on to claim

    Israel, and that the motion judge committed several errors in his analysis
    that, individually or collectively, render his conclusion unreasonable. In

    judges reasons, three factors drove his analysis: first, the availability of
    videoconferencing to obtain the testimony of witnesses unwilling or unable to
    come to Ontario; second, Goldhars undertaking to fund travel and accommodation
    expenses for Haaretzs witnesses; and third, the lack of evidence concerning
    the likely testimony of Haaretzs proposed witnesses.<b> </b></span></p>

lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Contrary to Haaretzs arguments, in my view, the
    motion judge was entitled to accept that reluctant foreign witnesses could be
    compelled to provide evidence in Israel through the use of letters of request
    and that videoconferencing was a potential means of obtaining the evidence of
    any witnesses unwilling to come to Ontario. </span></p>

    undermine Goldhars submissions that these methods would be available in this case.
    Haaretz bore the burden of demonstrating that Israel is the clearly more
    appropriate forum. On this record, it was not unreasonable for the motion judge
    to accept that Ontario letters of request would be honoured by Israel and that
    videoconferencing would be available in that jurisdiction.</span></p>

    judicial commentary, the use of technology and interpreters cannot be viewed as
    undermining the fairness of a civil trial. We live in an age of international
    communication and commerce. Multi-jurisdictional parties  and witnesses who do
    not speak either of Canadas official languages  are to be expected. Courtroom
    procedures must accommodate testimony by videoconferencing. Interpreters have
    long been a common feature of the Canadian judicial system. The motion judges
    implicit conclusion that using these procedures would not undermine the
    fairness of the trial was not unreasonable.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge carefully qualified
    the effect of Goldhars offer to fund the travel and accommodation expenses of
    the foreign witnesses when he noted that the offer did not address the
    inconvenience of proceeding in Ontario.</span></p>

    motion judge was unreasonably skeptical about Haaretzs proposed witnesses and
    their evidence. The Israeli lawyer and Mr. Barzel made conflicting claims about
    whether various of the proposed witnesses had been contacted by Haaretz. In
    both instances, their information was second hand. While many of Haaretzs
    proposed witnesses could have information about relevant matters, the record
    contains scant information about what particular witnesses are actually likely
    to say. Importantly, Mr. Marouani, the reporter who wrote the article, did not
    provide an affidavit on the motion. Nor did Haaretz produce any witness
    statements or even any notes of conversations with the proposed witnesses. In
    these circumstances, the motion judge was entitled to treat Haaretzs proposed
    witness list with caution.</span></p>

    broad publication in Israel to argue there was no evidence in the record of
    loss of reputation in Ontario. Given that the article was published much more
    widely in Israel, Haaretz argues the motion judge should have inferred that Goldhar
    would have suffered greater harm to his reputation there. Haaretz also points
    to articles published in Israel about Goldhars personal life as evidence that
    he is a public figure in Israel and accordingly that he has a significant
    reputation to protect there.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, Haaretzs reliance on the extensive
    publication in Israel as evidencing harm to Goldhars reputation there is
    misplaced. Relying on the extent of publication as a decisive factor in
    assessing where a plaintiff has suffered the most substantial harm to his or
    her reputation does little more than turn the most substantial harm approach
    into a proxy for the substantial publication rule, which the Supreme Court
    rejected in <em>Banro</em>, at para. 55. In any event, even assuming that Goldhar
    has some form of celebrity status in Israel, as the motion judge recognized,
    that does not address the nature of his reputation in Israel. Nor does it automatically
    follow that he would suffer more substantial reputational harm in Israel as
    compared to Ontario, where he lives and initially established both his business

    disparity in readership and of Haaretzs arguments concerning the subject
    matter of the article and Haaretzs connections to Israel. At the end of the
    day, what the motion judge considered important was that Goldhar lives and
    works in Ontario and that Haaretz chose to write an article about him impugning
    his management of an Israeli soccer team in a manner that implicated his
    Canadian business practices and integrity as a Canadian businessman. In these
    circumstances, the motion judge concluded it was no surprise  and not unfair 
    that Goldhar would choose to vindicate his reputation in Ontario. I see no

    in <em>Jameel</em>, only five people had accessed an internet news article,

    article in this case. Second, the plaintiff in <em>Jameel</em> had no
    connection to England, where the action was brought. The motion judge concluded,

    publishes an English language print edition of the paper.  Haaretz.co.il and
    Haaretz.com publish the newspaper online in Hebrew and in English

    Israel.  The article was published in print and on the Haaretz websites in
    Hebrew and in English and was estimated to have been read by approximately
    70,000 people in Israel.  The focus of the article was Goldhars management of
    the Maccabi Club.  While reference is made to Canada and the respondents
    Canadian business, the suggestion that the article places emphasis on this is,
    with respect, misplaced.  At its heart, the article is about one of the most
    popular soccer teams in Tel Aviv and how it is being managed by its owner.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge commenced his discussion of jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em> with a consideration of <em>Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</em>, 2012 SCC 17,
    [2012] 1 S.C.R. 572 and the four established presumptive connecting factors. 
    There was no suggestion that the appellants were domiciled or resident in
    Ontario or that they carried on business in Ontario.  Nor was any contract
    engaged.  Rather, because the article was read in Ontario, that is,
    communicated to at least one person other than the respondent, the tort was
    committed in Ontario.  As such, the appellants conceded that a tort was committed
    in Ontario and the existence of a presumptive connecting factor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge then considered whether the appellants had rebutted
    the presumption and concluded that they had not.  He anchored his conclusion on
    two bases: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:150%'>(i)    In <em>Éditions Écosociété Inc.
    v.</em> <em>Banro Corp.</em>, 2012 SCC 18, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 636, the Supreme
    Court did not view the absence of substantial publication in Ontario as having
    rebutted the presumption.  In that case, only 15 of the 5,000 published copies
    of a book containing libellous material (including 93 copies that had been sent
    to stores in Ontario) were in public libraries in Ontario and only one copy of
    the book had been checked out.: at paras. 22-24.</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:150%'>(ii)    Proof of harm to reputation is
    not an element of the tort of defamation and therefore is an irrelevant
    consideration.  In any event, if relevant, harm to the plaintiffs reputation
    was presumed and that presumption had not been rebutted: at para. 25.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>My colleague agrees with the motion judges conclusion that the
    presumption of jurisdiction had not been rebutted and that jurisdiction had
    been established over the foreign appellants.  In doing so, she quotes with
    approval Sharpe J.A.s observation in <em>Muscutt v. Courcelles</em> (2002), 60
    O.R. (3d) 20 (C.A.), at para. 44:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The real and substantial connection test requires only a real

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>To succeed in an action for defamation, the plaintiff must prove on
    a balance of probabilities that the defamatory words were communicated to at
    least one person other than the plaintiff: see <em>Crookes v. Newton</em>, 2011
    SCC 47, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 269, at para. 1.  As well, at the jurisdiction stage of
    the proceedings, the plaintiffs pleadings are accepted as true unless
    contradicted by evidence adduced by the defendants: see <em>Banro</em>, at
    para. 38.  Accordingly, all that is needed for the presumptive connecting
    factor to be found is for the plaintiff to plead that the alleged defamatory
    material was communicated to at least one person in Ontario other than the
    plaintiff.  While this is easy to establish in any defamation case, it is
    virtually automatic in a case of defamation on the Internet, where online
    publications are readily shared and accessed by users across the world.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>The tort of defamation presents an interesting challenge for
    the principles underlying the assumption of jurisdiction.  At common law, the

    alternative forum is clearly more appropriate.  A party must establish that:
    (i) a plaintiff should be denied the benefits of his or her decision to select
    a forum that is appropriate under the conflicts rules; (ii) it would be fairer
    to select the alternative forum; and (iii) it would be more efficient to select
    the alternative forum.  In <em>Van Breda</em>, he wrote, at para. 109 that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Forum non conveniens</em> may play an important role in
    identifying a forum that is clearly more appropriate for disposing of the
    litigation and thus ensuring fairness to the parties and a more efficient

  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-US>As noted by Professor Joost Blom, in
    <em>New Ground Rules for Jurisdictional Disputes: the Van Breda Quartet</em>;

    clear distinction between the role to be played by the jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em> analysis and that of <em>forum non conveniens</em>: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Another outcome of the new approach, again expressly desired by
    the court, is to separate jurisdiction <em>simpliciter</em>, which is now going
    to depend on specific rules, more clearly from the <em>forum non conveniens</em> discretion, which is inherently a matter of balancing both factual and
    policy-oriented factors.</p>

lang=EN-US>In contrast, in this case, my colleague identified a number of

    erred in accepting that the plaintiff would suffer a loss of juridical

lang=EN-US>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge considered some of the factors identified in <em>Breeden</em>. 
    On the first factor considered, comparative convenience and expense for the
    parties, the motion judge concluded that this factor favoured Israel.  This was
    understandable given that, among other things:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote style='line-height:
150%'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>all of the appellants are based in Israel;</p>

    among other things, expense, convenience, or any need to vindicate any
    reputation;</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:
150%'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the respondent is a billionaire, has a private jet and maintains a
    residence in Israel; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:
150%'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the submissions noted by the motion judge, at paras. 33-34, that:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote style='line-height:200%'>[A] lengthy libel trial thousands
    of miles from Israel would place a huge strain on the [appellants] who could
    not reasonably expect to be sued over the article in Canada.  The [appellants]
    also stated that a trial would be a massive commitment of time taking staff
    away from their function of gathering news.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote style='line-height:200%'>In addition, the [appellants]
    submit that the trial may need to be conducted in Hebrew with interpreters. 
    The [respondent] submits that interpreters may not be required as the
    cross-examinations of the three affiants from Israel on this motion were
    conducted in English.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge correctly found that this first factor favoured a
    trial in Israel.  Given the lack of evidence on any inconvenience or undue
    expense for the respondent associated with a trial in Israel, the first factor
    clearly and overwhelmingly supported a trial in Israel.  </span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Comparative Convenience and Expense for the Witnesses</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On the second factor, comparative convenience and expense for the
    witnesses, the motion judge concluded that this factor also favoured Israel,
    albeit slightly.  In my view, the motion judge erred in characterizing the
    distinction as slight.  My conclusion is not based on a mere difference of
    opinion but on the faulty basis of his reasoning.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judges analysis of the second factor rested on two
    bases. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, he relied on  his incorrect assessment of the availability of
    letters rogatory, an error acknowledged by my colleague, to compel the
    attendance of Israeli witnesses in Ontario.  It was undisputed that many of the
    witnesses from Israel will not testify voluntarily.  Subpoenas can be issued in
    Israel requiring the Israeli witnesses to attend at trial in Israel.  The same
    cannot be said with respect to a trial in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>On this issue, my colleague states at para. 70 of her reasons that
    the appellants led no evidence to undermine the respondents submissions on the
    availability of methods to deal with witnesses outside the jurisdiction.  She
    goes on to say that it was not unreasonable for the motion judge to accept that
    Ontario letters of request would be honoured by Israel and that
    videoconferencing would be available in that jurisdiction.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I have two difficulties with my colleagues argument.  First, there
    was no such acceptance by the motion judge.  He made no findings on these
    points.  Indeed, he did not even use the words letters of request or make a
    finding with respect to videoconferencing.  Second, with respect, typically evidence
    is filed in response to evidence, not to submissions.  The appellants cannot be
    faulted for failing to provide an evidentiary response to an issue raised in
    oral submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judges second finding which grounded his analysis was
    that the respondent undertook to fund the travel and accommodation costs of the
    appellants foreign witnesses in accordance with the rates provided in the <em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, Tariff A. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I make two observations.  First, a plaintiff ought not, due to his
    or her financial heft, be permitted to buy passage to a forum.  Second, as far
    as expenses are concerned, the only travel and accommodation rates in the <i>Rules</i> are contained in Tariff A of the <i>Rules</i>.  They bear little resemblance to
    the actual cost of accommodation.  For instance, $75 is allocated for overnight
    accommodation and meal allowance, an inadequate amount in Toronto by any measure.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge ignored this reality when he accepted that
    Goldhars undertaking addressed the issue of additional expense.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In addition, the motion judge ignored his own finding that the
    respondent filed no evidence identifying any witness he would call.  Indeed,
    there was no evidence before the motion judge that Goldhar himself would even
    be called as a witness.  In contrast to the non-existent witness list of the
    respondent, the appellants filed evidence anticipating and identifying 22 people
    who could be called to testify, 18 of whom reside in Israel.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>My colleague makes much of the fact that the author of the article,
    Marouani, did not file an affidavit and states that this was important. 
    However, I note that he is one of numerous appellants, is no longer employed by
    any of the corporate appellants, has no assets in Canada, and unlike Goldhar,
    who of course filed no affidavit, he does not have independent control of the
    proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While I accept that we live in an age of international communications
    and commerce, on the basis of the record before him, there were potentially 22
    witnesses to be called by the defence and none for the plaintiff.  There was no
    comparison to be made.  To use sports, if not soccer parlance, the respondent
    was scoreless. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judges error on letters rogatory, his
    failure to consider the purport of the Tariff, and his disregard of his finding
    on the absence of any witnesses identified by the respondent, in comparison to
    the appellants identification, all served to cause him to incorrectly conclude
    that the distinction between Ontario and Israel was slight.  His description,
    findings and conclusion were unreasonable and his decision is therefore not
    entitled to deference in this regard.  Rather, this factor overwhelmingly
    favoured Israel as the clearly more appropriate forum.</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Choice of Law</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Turning to the third factor, the motion judge concluded that choice
    of law favoured Ontario.  He stated that the <em>lex loci delicti</em> <a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[4]</span></span></span></a> of the tort of defamation
    was Ontario and that the most substantial harm to the respondents reputation
    was in Ontario.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In his amended statement of claim, Goldhar claimed general damages
    of $600,000 and punitive damages of $100,000.  He pleaded that he suffered
    damage to his reputation in his business and personal life.  He pleaded that he
    will continue to suffer damage, and in particular, financial loss, and that he
    conducts business in Israel, Canada and the United States, and will continue
    to suffer damages in these countries and elsewhere.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>When the stay motion was argued before the motion judge, in oral
    submissions made by his counsel, Goldhar undertook not to seek at the trial of
    this action to recover damages for reputational harm in Israel or anywhere else
    outside of Canada. In reaching his decision on substantial harm, the motion
    judge stated, at para. 50, that the damages undertaking provided by the
    [respondent] is a very significant factor.  In so finding, he relied on the
    Supreme Courts apparent acceptance of Lord Blacks undertaking in <em>Breeden</em> as being a significant factor in the analysis of the most substantial harm to
    reputation.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I will first address Goldhars undertaking and then will discuss <em>lex
    loci delicti</em> and substantial harm to reputation.</span></p>
  <h4><em><span style='line-height:
200%;font-weight:normal'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em>Undertaking</em></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>First, Goldhars undertaking, while similar to that of Lord Blacks
    in some respects, is materially different.  Lord Black undertook not to bring
    any libel action <u>in any other jurisdiction</u>, and has limited his claim to
    damages to his reputation in Ontario.  This is in contrast to Goldhars
    undertaking, which merely stated that he would limit his damages to those in
    Ontario <u>at the trial of this action</u>.  Goldhars undertaking does not
    preclude legal proceedings in other jurisdictions, whereas Lord Black
    relinquished such a right.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This omission in Goldhars undertaking detracts from one of the
    relevant factors for <em>forum non conveniens</em> enumerated in <em>Breeden</em>:
    the avoidance of a multiplicity of legal proceedings and conflicting
    decisions.  Goldhars undertaking does not prevent him from bringing an action
    in Israel where, based on the evidence of the expert witness filed, the
    limitation period for defamation actions is seven years.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, in relying on the Supreme Courts acceptance of Lord Blacks
    undertaking in <em>Breeden</em>, the motion judge failed to recognize that the
    court did not rely on that undertaking in isolation.  Rather, the court
    emphasized the evidence establishing Lord Blacks reputation in Ontario as
    being significant.  That evidence was detailed and extensive.  Lord Black also
    led evidence of the importance to him of his reputation in Ontario and his
    desire to vindicate it here.  LeBel J. wrote: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Lord Blacks undertaking and the evidence of his reputation in
    Ontario therefore suggests that, under the most substantial harm to
    reputation approach discussed in <em>Éditions Écosociété</em>, Ontario law
    should be applied to the libel actions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In fairness, LeBel J. also noted that the tort of defamation was
    committed in Ontario under <em>lex loci delicti</em> and Ontario law would
    apply on that basis.  In that regard, however, unlike this case, there had been
    massive republication of the impugned statements in three newspapers in
    Ontario.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Lastly, in <em>Banro</em>, it would appear that LeBel J. considered
    the most substantial harm test at least in part so as to discourage forum
    shopping in defamation cases.  That objective would be defeated if the mere
    fact of a late breaking undertaking could control the choice of law analysis. 
    In my view, his commentary in this regard should not be interpreted as
    permitting a damages limitation undertaking as being enough on its own to
    dictate the governing law.  The motion judge treated the respondents
    undertaking in essence as determinative of his choice of law analysis and in my
    view, erred in this regard.  </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The current choice of law rule for torts is derived from <em>Tolofson
    v. Jensen</em>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022.  There the Supreme Court enunciated a new
    rule for conflicts of laws stating at p. 1050 that at least as a general rule,
    the law to be applied in torts is the law of the place where the activity
    occurred, <em>i.e.</em> the <em>lex loci delicti</em>.  However, La Forest J.
    recognized that <em>lex loci delicti</em> may not be an appropriate rule for
    all torts.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In <em>Banro</em>, LeBel J. observed that there were arguments for
    changing the governing choice of law rules for cases of multi-jurisdictional
    defamation stating at para. 56:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although I need not decide the question in this case, I note
    that one possible alternative to the <em>lex loci delicti</em> in defamation
    cases, which has gained some significant support, may be the place of most
    substantial harm to reputation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It would appear from LeBel J.s commentary on defamation that some
    support has been given to the place of most substantial harm to reputation as
    being the yardstick on which choice of law should be based.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    curb forum shopping as there would be little strategic advantage to forum
    shopping if the conflicts rules were to require application of the same law
    regardless of where the matter were tried.  He referred to Professor
    Jean-Gabriel Castels opinion that rules of jurisdiction and of choice of law
    address different concerns and  the test of place of publication should not
    always be used for both purposes.: J.-G. Castel, <em><span style='font-style:

lang=EN-US>The Internet makes information easily accessible across
    jurisdictional lines.  In the newspaper world, as a matter of practical
    reality, it is not easy for a publisher to restrict the availability of its
    published materials.  The application of <em>lex loci delicti</em> to Internet
    communication cases frequently exposes people who engage in speech or
    expression in one jurisdiction to civil liability in another.  See Daniel
    Taylor, <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Libel Tourism: Protecting Authors

    observes, ours is a world without informational borders.  The willingness of a
    foreign court to exercise jurisdiction for defamation actions based on where
    the defamatory content is accessed rather than where it is produced exposes foreign
    newspapers and foreign journalists to legal actions in countries around the

    further heightened by the prospect of libel tourism.  Even more daunting than
    the idea of facing a defamation lawsuit at home is that of facing such a suit
    in a foreign jurisdiction that may offer less protection to academic freedom
    and impose more severe sanctions.</p>

  <p class=CQuote>At a time when critical scholarship is increasingly

  <p class=CQuote>In order to establish <em>jurisdiction</em> <em>simpliciter</em>,
    Canadian common law courts should continue to assume jurisdiction on the basis
    of the place of tort.  This rule would not promote libel tourism as it is kept
    in check by the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens</em> and also by a choice
    of law rule which would apply the law of the place of most substantial harm to
    the plaintiffs reputation, rather than the law of the place of publication. 
    This choice of law rule maintains a proper balance between the reputational
    interests of the plaintiff and the freedom of speech concerns of the defendant
    in addition to respecting comity as the organizing principle of the conflict of

lang=EN-US>The motion judge relied on both <i>lex loci delicti</i> and
    substantial harm to reputation in concluding that the applicable law was that
    of Ontario.  In my view, the motion judge erred in his analysis of choice of
    law. I have already addressed the issue of the undertaking.  In discussing
    choice of law, the motion judge also did not consider that, as pleaded, the
    tort occurred in both Ontario and in Israel. Secondly, while harm may be
    presumed, there was no evidence of substantial harm to Goldhars reputation in
    Ontario.  Thirdly, the motion judge did not consider the principle of comity. 
    Although on a different point, in <em>Kaynes v. BP</em>, 2014 ONCA 580, 122
    O.R. (3d) 162, Sharpe J.A. found that the motion judge in that case had
    properly concluded that Ontario had jurisdiction but had erred in her <em>forum
    non conveniens</em> analysis by failing to consider the principle of comity. 
    As such, this court reversed the motion judges decision and imposed a stay of
    proceedings.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Given the motion judges errors, identification of the applicable
    law falls to be decided by this court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As I have stated, in <em>Banro</em>, LeBel J. said that in that
    case, nothing turned on the question of whether <i>lex loci delicti</i> ought
    to be abandoned as the choice of law rule in multijurisdictional defamation
    cases and that therefore it was prudent to leave this issue for another day. 
    However, he did observe that the most substantial harm test may be more
    appropriate than the <em>lex loci delicti </em>test in cases of
    multi-jurisdictional defamation.  To repeat, at para. 56, he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he question of whether the <em>lex loci delicti</em> represents the proper rule for choice of law in defamation remains.  Although I
    need not decide the question in this case, I note that one possible alternative
    to the <em>lex loci delicti</em> in defamation cases, which has gained some
    significant support, may be the place of most substantial harm to reputation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As discussed, in an Internet age, in my view, <i>lex loci delicti</i> is too thin a strand on which to anchor choice of law in an Internet defamation
    case such as this one. Using a most substantial harm test incorporates considerations
    of freedom of speech, comity and reputation.  Accordingly, I propose to apply
    such a test.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>  As no Canadian court has formally adopted the most substantial
    harm rule, there is no clear guidance on how it should be applied.  In <em>Banro</em> at para. 59, LeBel J. referred to factors adopted in Australia to address the
    most substantial harm test.  These factors provide a useful guide in this
    case.  They are:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the place at the time of publication where the plaintiff was ordinarily
    resident or, in the case of a corporation, the place where the corporation had
    its principal place of business at that time;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the extent of publication in each relevant jurisdiction;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the extent of harm sustained by the plaintiff in each relevant
    jurisdiction; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>any other matter that the court considers relevant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While I note that obviously Goldhar is engaged in the business of
    soccer in Israel, indeed he pleads in his statement of claim that he conducts
    business there, the first factor favours the law of Ontario, as the respondent
    is ordinarily resident in Ontario.  However, the remaining three factors all
    favour applying the law of Israel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>There is no question that the extent of publication in Ontario is
    dwarfed by the extent of publication in Israel.  This factor favours the law of
    Israel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Second, the plaintiff led no evidence to establish a significant
    reputation in Ontario.  The allegations in his pleadings do not establish a
    reputation.  Further, the evidence led by the respondent is from two of his
    employees who claim that the article did not lessen their (or their
    colleagues) opinion of Goldhar.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In contrast, there is evidence from the appellants that the
    respondent has celebrity status in Israel and is often discussed in the
    Israeli media.  In his amended statement of claim, the respondent pleaded that
    he continues to suffer damages in Israel, Canada and the United States.  Taken
    together, the facts support the conclusion that any harm suffered in Israel was
    much more significant than any allegedly suffered in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Finally, the article was written in Israel about an Israeli soccer
    team and aimed at an Israeli audience.  While Goldhar may be habitually
    resident in Ontario, he has chosen to buy one of the most popular soccer clubs
    in Israel and to become involved in a very public and high-profile enterprise
    in that country.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>A consideration of these factors leads me to conclude that under the
    most substantial harm test, the law of Israel should govern the parties
    dispute and is therefore the applicable law.</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juridical Advantage</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Although not mentioned in either <em>Van Breda</em> or <em>Breeden</em>,
    the fourth factor relied upon by the motion judge was juridical advantage.  He
    concluded that this factor favoured a trial in Ontario.  He divided his
    discussion on this issue into two categories: the appellants submissions on
    Israels law of defamation and the respondents submissions.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The respondent advanced two juridical advantages associated with
    having the action tried in Ontario: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the respondents counsels advice that the respondent would serve a jury
    notice; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the availability of a public figure defence in Israel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge stated that he could not draw the conclusion sought
    by either party on the issue of the availability of a public figure defence in
    Israel.  Given his reluctance to rely on this factor and in the absence of
    identification of any other factor, the motion judge must be taken to have
    relied solely on the availability of a jury trial in Ontario to conclude that
    the loss of juridical advantage favoured a trial in Ontario.  Again to repeat,
    I agree with my colleague that the motion judge erred in accepting that the
    respondent would suffer a loss of juridical advantage in this regard. 
    Accordingly, there was nothing to anchor the motion judges finding that this
    fourth factor favoured Ontario.  Consequently, at most, this factor is neutral.</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fairness</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The last factor considered by the motion judge was fairness.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In reaching his conclusion that fairness favoured a trial in
    Ontario, the motion judge focused on vindication of reputation in the place
    where the respondent lives and works as the key determinant.  No mention was
    made of the huge financial strain and financial pressures on the appellants and
    the juxtaposition of the respondents circumstances.  No mention was made on the
    ability to disseminate in Ontario, through Google Alerts and otherwise, the
    outcome of any trial in Israel so as to achieve a vindication of reputation. 
    No mention was made of the range of monetary awards available to the respondent
    if successful in Ontario and their minimal nature relative to the respondents
    circumstances.  No mention was made of the competing theory that this lawsuit
    was instituted in Ontario with a view not to protect a reputation, but to
    burden a foreign newspaper and individuals, no longer employed by the corporate
    parties, with the expense and attendant time away from work implicit with an
    order for trial in Ontario, or to use the appellants terminology, to muzzle
    the newspaper from commentary on the respondents actions in Israel.  The on
    the fly undertakings made at the hearing of the motion itself offer some
    confirmation of that theory.  These omissions, coupled with my earlier
    comments, undermine the motion judges conclusion on fairness.  When one
    considers these factors, fairness clearly favours Israel.</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='page-break-after:
avoid'>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enforcement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Lastly, I note that although the motion judge enumerated the factors
    considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Breeden</em>, he neglected to address
    all of them.  Most notably, he said nothing about enforcement.  The only evidence
    before him on that issue was that the appellants had no assets in Ontario
    whereas one may readily infer from the evidence that the respondent does have
    assets in Israel.  Based on the record before him, this factor therefore would
    also favour Israel.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>Summary</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>To summarize, given the low threshold that permits jurisdiction in a
    defamation case to be taken by an Ontario court, a robust and carefully
    scrutinized review must be undertaken by a motion judge on a stay motion based
    on <em>forum non conveniens</em>.  Here, such a review was not undertaken. 
    Furthermore, and in any event, given the errors, the decision is not entitled
    to deference.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>When the issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i> is considered anew,
    the relevant factors lead to the inevitable conclusion that the appellants have
    established that Israel is clearly the more appropriate forum.  Additionally,
    such an outcome is in the interests of justice.</span></p>

  <p style='text-align:justify'>Though he spends most of his time
    in Canada, Maccabi Tel Aviv owner Mitch Goldhar runs his club down to every
    detail. But could his penny pinching and lack of long term planning doom the
    team.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>by David Marouani</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Crises are par for the course at
    Maccabi Tel Aviv, even when the club appears to be on an even keel. Most of the
    crises dont make it onto the publics radar, but they have one thing in
    common: their connection to way that Canadian owner Mitch Goldhar runs the
    club.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Just over a year ago, Goldhars
    representative in Israel, Jack Angelides, complained about the job that Clarice
    Zadikov, the long-time CFO of the team, was doing. Goldhars immediate response
    was to suggest appointing someone to do an identical job, with a slightly
    different title  but reporting back to the owner. So Tomer Shmuel was
    appointed commercial manager and Zadikovs authority was slowly eroded. Two
    months ago, the policy had the desired effect and Zadikov reached an agreement
    with Angelides over her retirement.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Mitchs game plan is to wear
    down anybody who he wants to get rid of, until theyve had enough and decide to
    leave of their own accord, one club insider told Haaretz this week.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The departure of CEO Uzi Shaya,
    following the gradual erosion of his powers, is a case in point. The dismissal
    of Avi Nimni is the exception that proves the rule, the same insider said. For
    the most part, [Goldhar is] supremely patient. One could even say hes cold and
    calculated.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Goldhar is also playing with time
    in the battle between coach Moti Ivanir and star striker Barak Yitzhaki. Goldhar
    landed in Israel on Friday, but he opted not to address the spat until Monday
    evening.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>According to club sources, the
    owner is currently observing the situation and has not yet decided how he will
    handle this latest crisis.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Whatever happens, one source
    said, he will be remembered as the knight in shining armor who came in and
    saved the day.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Goldhars management model was
    imported directly from his main business interest  a partnership with Wal-Mart
    to operate shopping centers in Canada. He even spelled out his managerial
    vision in a leaflet distributed to fans ahead of Sunday nights derby against
    Hapoel Tel Aviv.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>By dealing with disciplinary
    matters, commitment and the right approach, he wrote, we are now at the dawn
    of a cultural revolution  a process of building a new sporting culture.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Within the club, however, there
    are those who believe that Goldhars managerial culture is based on overconcentration
    bordering on megalomania, penny-pinching and a lack of long-term planning.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>With all due respect to cultural
    revolutions, the gap between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Maccabi Haifa is getting
    wider since he arrived, said one team insider.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>And with all due respect to
    Angelides, everyone at Maccabi knows that its a one-man show. Anything that
    Goldhars Cypriot lieutenant says to the players or to the coaching staff is
    prefixed by the words Mitch says</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When Ivanir read the riot act to
    his players at a meeting in Caesarea last week, almost every sentenced included
    the phrase, the owner told me that</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Despite running the club from
    afar, decisions are only made once Goldhar has given them the green light. He
    was even involved in the minute details of the search for a location for the
    clubs new souvenir shop.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>I want to invest in branding the
    store, he told his employees over a year ago. For months, he was presented
    with dozens of potential locations for the store in north Tel Aviv, but
    rejected them all. In the end, he decided to renovate the mobile home in the
    south of the city where the store is currently located.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>Do as your boss says</b></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Goldhar boasts to his business
    contacts in Toronto that he is not only the owner of Maccabi Tel Aviv but also
    its soccer director. The last time he was in Israel, he brought Ivanir into his
    office and tried to tell him how the team should be playing. [Haris]
    Medunjanin should be playing in the same position that he plays for the
    [Bosnian] national team, Goldhar reportedly told his coach. In fact, it was at
    Goldhars suggestion that Medunjanin was returned to the starting line-up at
    the expense of Gal Alberman. Ivanir doesnt know how to respond in these
    situations, says a club source. But he believes that he really should do as
    his boss suggested  even if that boss knows nothing about soccer.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This week, too, in the aftermath
    of the defeat in Sundays derby match, Goldhar got involved.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>You showed that youve got the
    ability, he told the players, but you seem to have misplaced the character
    that you showed at the start of the season. I am convinced that you still have
    that character and nows the time that you have to show it.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Goldhar has invested hundreds of millions
    of shekels in Maccabi since he arrived on scene some two and a half years ago,
    but club sources say that he borders on the frugal when it comes to the
    managerial side of the club. When Angelides was first offered a job, for
    example, Goldhar did not see fit to offer him a company car. Angelides
    complained bitterly but silently about this, until he eventually persuaded one
    of the teams sponsors to provide him with a vehicle  without Goldhars
    knowledge.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In an interview with Yedioth
    Ahronoths Nahum Barnea, Goldhar spoke about how much he values the work done
    behind the scenes by the clubs equipment manager, David Zachi, who earns a
    fraction of the salary of the players. What he failed to point out, however, is
    that he has steadfastly refused to raise Zachis measly pay by just a few
    hundred shekels. To Goldhars credit, it should be noted that, when it comes to
    frugality, he practices what he preaches: he rented a dingy apartment for
    himself in Tel Aviv and he drives nothing more fancy than a Hundai Getz.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Goldhar, according to club
    insiders, thrives on the media attention that Maccabi brings him. Despite the
    fact that he planned his latest visit to Israel well in advance, for example,
    and the crew aboard his private jet was briefed a week in advance, he made sure
    that the media were kept in the dark, in order to create an aura of
    expectation.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>When Maccabi played against
    Panathinaikos earlier this season, he read everything that was written about
    him [<em>sic</em>] the Greek press and even cut out a cartoon of him that
    appeared in one [<i>sic</i>] the paper, asking all his employees whether it was
    flattering. He also has articles in which his name appears translated into
    English.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Despite his many statements,
    Goldhar does not have a long-term plan for the team. The only plan he has
    presented so far has been to upgrade the clubs training facilities, but that
    still hasnt happened. The only changes he has made have been to the youth team
    set-up, and he often boasts about that teams accomplishments.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>This has become a sore point with
    former owner Alex Shnaider, who complained that Goldhar was taking credit for a
    five-year plan that was implemented before he even arrived at the club. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>As for his long-term future,
    Goldhar says that hes here to stay. He is so keen to prove to everybody that
    his business model can work that he wont leave until hes won at least a
    league championship, according to one of his close associates.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>There are those, however, who see
    things differently. Goldhar plays soccer at least once a week in Toronto with
    Ilan Saadi, a former professional player and close friend. One of the people
    who plays with them says that, between the lines, there are clear signs that
    Goldhar is getting frustrated with Maccabi.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Hes very distressed at the way
    the team is playing, the source says. If I understand him correctly, he will
    give the team until the end of this season to win the championship and then hell
    start looking for someone to take Maccabi off his hands.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>Goldhar declined to comment for
