  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Simmons
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Levinter &amp; Levinter LLP, acted as counsel for the plaintiffs
    (the “personal respondents”) in this personal injury action for many years.
    After their solicitor-client relationship broke down, the appellant somehow obtained
    a judgment in the personal injury action against their former clients, the
    personal respondents, for $206,000, for legal fees and disbursements. A
    different law firm, Himelfarb Proszanski LLP (the “respondent law firm”), took
    over conduct of the personal injury action for the personal respondents and
    participated in the proceeding by which the $206,000 judgment was obtained.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties to the personal injury action later moved under rule 7.08 of
    the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, for approval of a
    proposed settlement of the action. Court approval was required because two of
    the personal respondents were under a disability. Under the terms of the
    proposed settlement, the appellant was to receive $206,000 on account of its
    legal fees and disbursements in accordance with the $206,000 judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The settlement approval judge did not approve the proposed settlement. Among
    other things, he recommended in an endorsement that the appellant receive $102,500
    in satisfaction of its account. In addition, he stipulated that if all parties
    and law firms were not prepared to resolve matters as he suggested, “the
    settlement is not approved” and all issues would have to be resolved “in an
    active litigation process with independent representation for [the injured
    personal respondent].”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not consent to the settlement approval judge’s recommendation.
    Nonetheless, the respondent law firm advised the appellant that it intended to
    obtain a judgment implementing the settlement approval judge’s recommendations.
    In due course, the respondent law firm obtained a “partial judgment” signed by
    the settlement approval judge, which provided, in part, that the appellant
    would receive $102,500 in satisfaction of its outstanding account.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About a year after the partial judgment was issued, the appellant moved
    for an order under rule&nbsp;59.06(2)(c) to “carry into operation” the $206,000
    judgment by varying the partial judgment to accord with the $206,000 judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on s. 34(2) of the <em>Solicitors Act</em>, R.SO. 1990, c. S.15,
    the appellant also requested an order declaring that the respondent law firm is
    jointly and severally liable for the balance owing to the appellant under the
    $206,000 judgment because the respondent law firm disbursed all funds payable
    under the partial judgment in the face of the $206,000 judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed the appellant’s motion, holding that rule&nbsp;59.06(2)(c)
    does not authorize a Superior Court judge to determine which of two subsisting
    Superior Court orders is correct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals from the motion judge’s order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The main issue on appeal is the proper interpretation
    of rule</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>59.06(2)(c).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In oral submissions on appeal, the appellant also asked
    that its motion be amended, if necessary, to claim relief under rule 37.14 and
    that relief be granted under that rule. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The personal
    injury action</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 1992, the personal respondent Zahira Sheikh (“Ms. Sheikh”) suffered
    serious injuries in a car-pedestrian accident. She and the other personal
    respondents retained the appellant and, in December 1993, commenced this action
    for damages arising from the accident. At the time the action was commenced,
    the personal respondent Yasmeen Sheikh was a minor. In 1998, Ms. Sheikh was
    declared incapable of managing her personal and financial affairs and two of
    the personal respondents, Ahmed Hussein Sheikh and Lubna Sheikh, were appointed
    as joint guardians of her person and property. </p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    solicitor-client relationship breaks down</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant acted as counsel for the personal respondents for many years
    both in relation to the personal injury action and in relation to a no-fault
    benefits claim that was settled in 1998.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2007, the solicitor-client relationship between the appellant and the
    personal respondents broke down and the respondent law firm took over the
    conduct of the action for the personal respondents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, at a case conference held in February 2007,
    the defendants in the action indicated they would be alleging impropriety on
    the part of Ms. Sheikh’s family members in relation to the use of accident
    benefits funds. Ultimately, the Public Guardian and Trustee began an
    investigation into the family members’ guardianship. The appellant asserts that,
    at a March 2007 pre-trial, Ms. Sheikh’s family members provided instructions to
    settle her claim but then later disputed that such instructions had been
    provided. According to the appellant, the solicitor-client relationship broke
    down after these events. </p>
  <h3 style='text-align:justify'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The appellant obtains a charging order and judgment for its legal fees</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the respondent law firm assumed carriage of the action, the appellant
    and the respondent law firm were unable to agree on how to address the
    appellant’s outstanding account. In September 2008, the appellant obtained a
    charging order with the consent of the respondent law firm. The charging order
    provides that the appellant “is entitled to a first charge in the amount of
    $485,868.05, plus interest, or in the alternative, an amount to be determined
    by an Assessment Officer, in respect of the within action for [its] legal fees,
    costs, charges and disbursements incurred in the within action.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>According to the appellant’s account, the </span>$485,868.05
    comprised <span lang=EN-US>$269,305.50 for fees, $54,140.04 for disbursements,
    $18,570.98 for taxes and $143,851.53 for unpaid invoices from third-party
    suppliers, including $64,941.66 for outside counsel.</span><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charging order also required the appellant to forward its file to
    the respondent law firm within 10 days.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the charging order being made, the respondent law firm had commenced
    an assessment proceeding on behalf of the personal respondents concerning the
    appellant’s outstanding account. On June 11, 2011, the appellant and the respondent
    law firm agreed that the appellant’s outstanding account would be settled for
    $150,000 on account of fees and $56,000 on account of disbursements, for a
    total of $206,000. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No certificate of assessment was taken out arising from the June 2011
    settlement of the assessment proceeding. Instead, the appellant brought a
    motion in the personal injury action “for enforcement of the settlement of
    [its] account.” On April 27, 2012, a judgment was issued in this action which provides
    that the personal respondents shall pay to the appellant a total of $206,000 on
    account of fees and disbursements together with post-judgment interest of 3 per
    cent per annum from June 13, 2011. The appeal record does not include the
    motion record that led to the $206,000 judgment. However, the motion judge’s
    reasons relating to the $206,000 judgment recite the settlement and describe
    the contested issue on the motion as relating to interest. The formal judgment
    describes the relief sought on the motion. However, the appeal record includes
    no explanation of the basis on which this relief was, or could be, obtained in the
    personal injury action. </p>
  <h3>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The settlement
    approval process</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the appellant, at some point it learned from the respondent
    law firm that it was preparing material for court approval of a settlement the
    parties to the personal injury action had reached and that the appellant’s account
    would be included in the settlement approval material in accordance with the $206,000
    judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 22, 2013, the settlement approval judge, who also conducted the
    February 2007 case conference and March 2007 pre-trial, issued an endorsement
    in which he was critical of the appellant’s account and described the $206,000
    judgment several times as a “purported judgment.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his endorsement, the settlement approval judge observed that “[a]ll
    of the problems with the care for Ms. Sheikh and misuse of her money arose on
    [the appellant’s] watch.” He said that as Ms. Sheikh was under a disability and
    Yasmeen Sheikh was recited as a minor, court approval of the fees settlement
    was required. He said that “[w]hat purports to be a Judgment” was issued as the
    result of the appellant’s motion for enforcement of the settlement and noted
    that the appellant was not a party to this action and that no new action, nor
    any application to enforce a private contract, had been started. Nor had Ms.
    Sheikh been provided with separate representation despite the conflict between
    her guardians in their personal capacity and their representative capacity. He
    expressed concern that fees and disbursements from the accident benefits file
    had “crept into this action”, that the $206,000 judgment was based on a
    contract entered into by a guardian with a conflict of interest, and that no
    determination had been made under rule 7<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> as to Ms. Sheikh’s liability for the fees and disbursements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The settlement approval judge was also critical of the account from
    outside counsel, which he appears to have mistakenly described as $143,851.53
    (as opposed to <span lang=EN-US>$64,941.66 disclosed in the appellant’s
    account) and which he said had been settled for $89,274.23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The settlement approval judge proposed that Ms. Sheikh’s liability to
    the appellant be fixed at $102,500 and that her liability to outside counsel be
    fixed at $41,000. He concluded his endorsement by stating that if all parties
    and law firms did not agree to his proposal, the settlement was not approved: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the parties and law firms are not prepared to resolve
    matters as suggested, the settlement is not approved and all issues among all
    parties will have to be resolved in an active litigation process with independent
    representation for Ms. Sheikh….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal record does not include the material
    filed with the settlement approval judge nor does the affidavit filed by the
    representative of the respondent law firm who had carriage of the file (the “lawyer
    with carriage”) (not Mr. Quance or Mr. Waldman) disclose whether he or anyone
    else appeared before the settlement approval judge prior to the April 22, 2013
    endorsement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, in a letter dated April 23, 2013 from
    the lawyer with carriage to all interested counsel, which was appended to the

    a solution under which the appellant would receive an additional $76,000,
    consisting of $41,000 allocated by the settlement approval judge to pay outside

    jurisdiction to give directions or make an order to carry an order into
    operation.” Further, in </span><em>Phillips Estate</em><span lang=EN-US>, the
    court stated the subrule extends to any situation “where a party seeks to
    remove a perceived impediment to the operation of an order, thereby allowing it
    to reflect the true intention of the court which granted the order.” According
    to the appellant, no case law supports the proposition that rule 59.06(2)(c)
    cannot remove an impediment to the operation of an order just because the
    impediment is contained in a subsequent order. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>, at para. 81, where the Supreme Court of Canada referred
    specifically to rule 59.06(2)(c) before observing that “the practice of
    providing further direction on remedies in support of a decision is known to
    our courts, and does not undermine the availability of appeal.”</span></p>

    afford a remedy, the appellant should be permitted to amend its motion on

    person affected by an order obtained without notice to move to vary or set
    aside the order. Although the rule provides that the person should move
    forthwith, delay is not a bar to relief being granted. It makes sense for this
    court to deal with the matter on the merits under rule 37.14 because the issues
    for the court are essentially the same as the issues raised on the appellant’s
    motion under rule 59.06(2)(c) as is the record.</span></p>

    construed to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive
    determination of every civil proceeding on the merits” and that, where matters

    interpretive principles support reading authority into rule 59.06(2)(c) to
    grant the relief requested so that para.&nbsp;7 of the partial judgment would
    read that the appellant shall receive $206,000, instead of $102,500, in
    satisfaction of its account. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where the rules contemplate that an existing

    (emphasis added) where it was obtained on a motion without notice, or where a
    party fails to appear on a motion through accident, mistake or insufficient
    notice. Rule 59.06(1) provides that an order “</span><em>may be amended</em>”<i> </i><span lang=EN-US>(emphasis added) where it contains an error arising from
    an accidental slip or omission or where it “requires amendment in any
    particular on which the court did not adjudicate.” And rule 59.06(2)(a) permits
    a party to move to “have an order<i> </i></span><em>set aside or varied</em><span

    was made” (emphasis added). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unlike these rules, rule 59.06(2)(c) does not

lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, contrary to the appellant’s attempts to
    characterize its request as nothing more than carrying the $206,000 judgment
    into operation, l agree with the motion judge that to do so, the motion judge
    would have had to choose between conflicting orders of the Superior Court and
    would have to invalidate a subsisting order of the Superior Court. Rule
    59.06(2)(c) does not provide a Superior Court judge with authority to do so. I
    also agree with the motion judge, for the reasons he gave, that none of the
    authorities on which the appellant relied before the motion judge supported
    granting the relief requested.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, rule 59.06(2) specifies that “a party”
    may make a motion in the proceeding for enumerated relief. As the appellant is

    the order, by a notice of motion that is served forthwith after the order comes
    to the person’s attention and names the first available hearing date that is at
    least three days after service of the notice of motion.” Rule 37.14(2) provides
    that “[o]n a motion under subrule (1), the court may set aside or vary the
    order on such terms as are just.”</span></p>

    the requirements of the rule make it clear that a party or other person
    affected by an order who seeks relief must proceed with dispatch and that any
    significant delay could militate against granting relief. Particularly in a
    case involving a final order, the requirement to move promptly serves not only to
    avoid prejudice, but also to preserve the important value of finality in civil
    litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, the appellant’s lengthy delay in taking
    steps to challenge the partial judgment together with its failure to advance
    any real explanation for much of that delay tells strongly against granting
    relief. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant received the partial judgment on
    July 5, 2013 but took no steps to challenge it until almost a year later on June
    28, 2014. The only explanations provided for this lengthy delay are that the
    instructing partner was ill and out of the office through to the beginning of 2014
    and that following his return he sought advice from counsel. </span></p>

    to protect its own interests simply because a senior partner was ill. But even
    if the delay while the instructing partner was ill was reasonable, the further
    delay of six months to determine a course of action is not. Timelines for
    taking steps are an integral part of the </span><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><span

lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, the appeal record does not
    disclose how the partial judgment was obtained in the absence of the appellant’s
    consent to the reduction of its legal fees or whether the lawyer with carriage
    advised the settlement approval judge of the lack of consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The settlement approval judge said in his April
    22, 2013 endorsement that if the parties and law firms did not accept his
    suggested resolution, the proposed settlement was not approved and “all issues
    among all parties [would] have to be resolved in an active litigation process
    with independent representation for Ms. Sheikh.” Considering the endorsement as
    a whole, the settlement approval judge was contemplating not only that the
    personal injury action would continue, but also that the $206,000 judgment
    would be challenged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the face of this endorsement, it is difficult

lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, based on this endorsement, in the
    absence of the appellant’s consent, advising the settlement approval judge that
    the appellant was not consenting to a reduction of its legal fees was not
    optional, it was mandatory. To the extent that the respondent law firm may be
    relying on its advice to the appellant that it intended to obtain the partial
    judgment as a justification for not informing the settlement approval judge
    that the appellant was not consenting, such reliance is ill-conceived. In the
    face of the settlement approval judge’s endorsement, the lawyer with carriage
    had an overriding duty to advise the court the appellant was not consenting,
    lest the court be misled. That is because the settlement approval judge had
    said the settlement was not approved unless all parties and law firms agreed
    with his proposal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If the lawyer with carriage did not advise the
    settlement approval judge that the appellant was not consenting, that omission,
    although possibly well-intentioned, could amount to serious misconduct that
    could potentially, of itself, justify an order setting aside the partial
    judgment, either in whole or in part, despite the appellant’s delay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In oral argument, the respondents did not dispute
    that a possible inference arising from the appeal record is that the lawyer
    with carriage did not advise the settlement approval judge that the appellant
    was not consenting to the settlement approval judge’s proposal. Another
    possible inference may be that the settlement approval judge changed his mind.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That said, had the appellant moved under rule 37.14
    to set aside all or part of the partial judgment, as it was entitled to do, the
    rule 37.14 motion record would properly have included all the material that was
    before the settlement approval judge both when he issued his April 22, 2013
    endorsement and when he signed the partial judgment. That material was not
    included in the rule 59.06(2)(c) motion record. Nor, apparently, did the
    appellant cross-examine the lawyer with carriage on his affidavit filed on the rule
    59.06(2)(c) motion to determine how he obtained the partial judgment in the
    face of the settlement approval judge’s April 22, 2013 endorsement and in the
    absence of the appellant’s consent. In the result, the appeal record does not
    include important evidence that would have been before the court on a rule
    37.14 motion concerning how the partial judgment was obtained. Responsibility
    for this omission lies squarely at the feet of the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Taking account of all the circumstances, I would
    not permit the appellant to amend its motion on appeal. The strongest argument
    favouring the appellant’s entitlement to relief under rule 37.14 on appeal lies
    in the possible inference that the lawyer with carriage did not advise the
    settlement approval judge that the appellant was not consenting to the
    reduction of its legal fees. But had the appellant moved under rule 37.14, that
    question would have been squarely before the court and could have been
    determined based on proper material. In the absence of a proper record, I
    conclude that it would be unfair to the respondents to permit the appellant to
    amend its motion on appeal to claim relief under rule 37.14. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, assuming the appellant may be
    entitled to relief under rule 37.14, it seems possible to me that the only proper
    remedy may be to set aside the partial judgment in its entirety. If that is the
    case, it would be necessary that the appellant also serve the defendants to the
    action with its notice of motion. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss
    the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for costs, I would address the issue in two parts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the first part, I would decline to award costs of the appeal to the
    respondent law firm relating to the issue of its joint and several liability
    for the balance claimed by the appellant under the $206,000 judgment. The
    question of how the lawyer with carriage obtained the partial judgment without
    the appellant’s consent in the face of the settlement approval judge’s
    endorsement cried out for an explanation to the court. The respondent law firm
    failed to provide that explanation. I would not therefore make an order for
    costs of the appeal relating to the joint and several liability issue in favour
    of the respondent law firm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the second part, unless the respondent law firm has, or proposes to,
    waive its fees and disbursements to the personal respondents in connection with
    the underlying motion and the appeal, I would direct the respondent law firm to
    deliver brief written submissions within 14 days following the release of this
    endorsement concerning whether an order should be made under rule 57.07(1)(a)
    disallowing any costs of the appeal or the motion below as between the
    respondent law firm and the personal respondents and requiring the respondent
    law firm to reimburse the personal respondents for any such costs already paid,
    if any. The submissions should disclose the costs incurred for the motion and
    the appeal and should identify the costs attributable to the rule 59.06 issue
    and those attributable to the joint and several liability issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The genesis of the underlying motion was the conduct of the lawyer with
    carriage in obtaining the partial judgment, apparently without the appellant’s
    consent. The personal respondents are innocent victims in the legal quagmire
    that has ensued.  Moreover, if the partial judgment was obtained without
    advising the settlement approval judge that the appellant was not consenting, it
    is difficult to understand why the personal respondents should bear any
    responsibility for the costs of proceedings arising from that omission. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the respondent law firm’s failure to explain how the partial
    judgment was apparently obtained without the appellant’s consent, the
    respondent should explain why the personal respondents should bear any of the
    costs of the appeal and the motion below. Depending on whether a rule
    57.07(1)(a) order is made, the court will also require information necessary to
    make an order for costs of the appeal in favour of the personal respondents
    against the appellant in relation to the rule 59.06 motion but excluding any
    costs for the joint and several liability issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, even if a rule 57.07(1)(a) order is made in favour of the
    personal respondents, I would not consider making a rule 57.07(1)(c) order in
    favour of the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was unsuccessful on the appeal. Further, the explanation
    provided for failing to take some steps on its own to make submissions to the
    settlement approval judge demonstrates a lack of diligence and initiative. The
    appellant also failed to cross-examine the lawyer with carriage on his
    affidavit filed on the rule 59.06 motion to determine how he obtained the
    partial judgment without the appellant’s consent in the face of the settlement
    approval judge’s endorsement. The appellant thus bears some responsibility for
    the partial judgment being taken out without its consent and significant
    responsibility for the inadequate record that is before the court.</p>
