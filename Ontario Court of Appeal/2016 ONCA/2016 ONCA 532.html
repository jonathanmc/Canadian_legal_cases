  <p class=Heard>Heard: June 22, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered and sentence
    imposed on December 3, 2014 by Justice Lesley M. Baldwin of the Ontario Court
    of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>BROWN J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, Gina DaFonte, a lawyer, appeals
    from the trial judge’s finding that she was guilty of criminal contempt of
    court and the sentence imposed of a $500.00 fine. The appellant is a sole
    practitioner. She was called to the bar in 2005. The finding of contempt arose
    from the appellant’s failure to attend a court hearing made peremptory to her
    client, Ms. Tracy Fleming.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would uphold the finding of contempt. However,
    I conclude the trial judge erred by failing to afford the appellant an
    opportunity to make submissions on sentence. As a result, I would set aside the
    conviction and the sentence of a fine and would substitute, by way of sanction
    for the finding of contempt, an absolute discharge, coupled with the referral
    of the appellant to the Law Society of Upper Canada for practice mentoring.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Chronology of Events</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January 2013, Ms. Fleming had entered guilty
    pleas to charges of assault against her husband and failure to comply with
    recognizance. When Ms. Fleming retained the appellant in July 2013, she was
    awaiting sentencing. Once retained, the appellant advised the Crown that an
    application to set aside the guilty pleas might be sought.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Fleming was represented by different counsel
    in matrimonial proceedings which involved custody issues. Following the
    appellant’s retainer, the matrimonial proceedings were adjourned to await the
    outcome of the application to set aside the guilty pleas.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That application initially was scheduled to be
    heard on October 4, 2013. It was adjourned to January 28, 2014 to enable the
    appellant to obtain the necessary transcripts. In December 2013, the appellant
    filed an application record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On January 28, the appellant informed Crown
    counsel she could not attend due to illness. As matters transpired, the presiding
    judge also was ill. The application to set aside was adjourned to February 4.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not attend court on February 4,
    nor did she inform her client or Crown counsel that she would not be attending.
    The application was put over to February 20.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 6, the Crown served and filed an
    application to secure case managements orders, with the application returnable on
    February 10.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s application was brought on before
    the trial judge on February 10. The appellant did not appear. The trial judge
    adjourned the matter to the following day. The appellant did appear at that
    time. The trial judge put over to Monday, March 10 the application to strike
    the pleas, and made the matter peremptory.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 10, Ms. Fleming appeared in court; the
    appellant did not. Court staff called the appellant’s contact number and spoke
    to her answering service. The service advised that the appellant was not
    answering her phone; the court staff left a message with the service for the
    appellant to call. The trial judge thereupon cited the appellant for contempt,
    and proceeded to dispose of the application to set aside the guilty pleas in
    the absence of the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant called court staff at 3:35 p.m.
    and asked staff to convey her apologies to the court for not appearing.
    According to the record of that call prepared by court staff, the appellant
    advised that “she has been extremely ill lately and has been bedridden and due
    to her illness misread her diary and did not realize that she was required for court
    today.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When her husband came home from work, the
    appellant went to a clinic where she was prescribed an antibiotic. In a few
    days, she was feeling better.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeared before the trial judge on
    March 17 and apologized for her absence the previous week. The trial judge set
    a date for the contempt hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held the contempt hearing on
    August 20, 2014. The appellant appeared and testified, as did her husband.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified that she had not been
    feeling well over the weekend before the hearing. On the morning of March 10,
    she felt fuzzy, confused, and disoriented. She did not realize it was Monday.
    It was only after she got out of bed in the afternoon and checked her cell
    phone did she see the messages that had been left by court staff and by Ms.
    Fleming’s family law counsel who informed the appellant that the trial judge
    had cited her for contempt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant again offered her apology to the
    court, and said she had taken steps to ensure she would not miss a court attendance
    again.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Reasons of the trial judge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge correctly identified the
    applicable test for criminal contempt of court as that set out by this court in <em>R. v. Glasner</em> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.). In <em>Glasner</em>,
    this court stated, at p. 242, that the <em>actus reus</em> of criminal contempt
    is conduct which seriously interferes with or obstructs the administration of
    justice or which causes a serious risk of interference or obstruction. The
    fault requirement “calls for deliberate or intentional conduct, or conduct
    which demonstrates indifference… akin to recklessness”: p. 244.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the appellant’s
    failure to attend the March 10 hearing had seriously interfered with the
    administration of justice, delaying not only the application to strike the
    pleas, but also the related family court proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge accepted the appellant had
    not deliberately failed to attend court, she concluded the appellant’s conduct
    demonstrated reckless indifference to her obligations to the court and her
    client. The trial judge held that the appellant’s conduct “went far beyond mere
    discourtesy or inconvenience” and interfered with the court’s authority and its
    ability to administer justice. She found the appellant guilty of criminal
    contempt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found the appellant’s apology
    did not purge her contempt, but was a mitigating factor concerning sanction. She
    fined the appellant $500 for her contempt. The trial judge also wrote that she
    would refer the matter to the Law Society “for any supervision or other action
    they deem appropriate.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Appellant’s counsel advised that the Law Society
    has opened a file on the matter, but he was not aware of the details, save that
    the Law Society’s investigation was in abeyance pending the disposition of this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Issues on the appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant advances several grounds of
    appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge erred in concluding the <em>mens
    rea</em> for contempt had been established because the reason for her failure
    to attend was an honest mistake;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge misapprehended the evidence
    about the availability of the appellant’s telephone records;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge erred in holding the appellant’s
    apology could not purge her contempt; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge erred in determining sentence
    without allowing the appellant an opportunity to make submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Analysis: Appeal from the contempt finding </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first three grounds of appeal relate to the
    issue of whether the trial judge erred in finding that the <em>mens rea</em> for criminal contempt had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant submits her illness caused
    her to make an honest mistake about the date of the court hearing and an honest
    mistake is incompatible with the subjective knowledge required for
    recklessness. The appellant contends the trial judge never rejected her
    evidence that she had not realized she was supposed to be in court on the
    Monday.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept this submission. When the trial
    judge’s reasons are read in their entirety, it is clear she considered and
    rejected the appellant’s explanation of an honest mistake. The trial judge did
    not believe the appellant’s explanation that flu medication had so disoriented
    and confused her that she did not know what day of the week it was. The trial
    judge emphasized the “strong prior warnings” given by the court to the
    appellant about the need to bring the strike plea matter to a final conclusion
    and the peremptory nature of the March 10 hearing. She also held that the
    appellant’s evidence about her illness and attendance at the doctor late on the
    Monday afternoon did not explain her failure to check her schedule and attend
    to her obligations. The trial judge found the appellant’s excuse for
    non-attendance in court to be part of “a pattern of unreasonable excuses”. The
    appellant does not contend the trial judge made any palpable and overriding
    error in making those findings of fact. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I also do not accept the appellant’s submission
    that the trial judge’s unfavourable view of her credibility was informed, in
    part, by a misapprehension of the evidence about the availability of her
    telephone records and the cell phone used at the time by the appellant’s
    husband. The trial judge clearly understood the appellant’s critical evidence
    that on March 10, 2014 she did not see the messages on her cell phone from her
    answering service, the court staff, and Ms. Fleming’s family law counsel until
    mid-afternoon because she did not check her phone that day until that time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the appellant argues the trial judge
    erred in holding that her apology could not purge her contempt, contrary to the
    decision of this court in <em>R. v. Martin</em> (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 248
    (Ont. C.A.), at p. 253, that a sincere apology can purge contempt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept this submission. A court hearing
    a contempt charge must consider the accused’s explanation, including any

    made out beyond a reasonable doubt: <em>Glasner</em>, at p. 244; <em>R. v.
    Devost</em>, 2010 ONCA 459, 256 C.C.C. (3d) 374, at para. 45. However, a judge
    is not obliged to accept an explanation or an apology: </span><em>Devost</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 45. In the present case, the trial judge did not take the
    position that a sincere apology could not purge contempt. Instead, having
    rejected the appellant’s explanation that an illness prevented her from
    attending to her court obligations, the trial judge was not prepared to accept
    that an apology based on the appellant’s explanation that she was ill raised a
    reasonable doubt. That conclusion was open to the trial judge on the evidence
    before her.</span></p>

    parties did not make any submissions about sentence. The record of the hearing
    discloses counsel proceeded on the basis that the only issue at the hearing was
    whether the appellant had committed criminal contempt. However, in her reasons
    for judgment, the trial judge immediately proceeded from making a finding of
    contempt to imposing the sanction of a fine. The trial judge then requested
    submissions from counsel on the amount of the fine.</span></p>

    submissions from the parties.</span></p>

    in exceptional circumstances where an <em>instanter</em> summary proceeding is
    justified, the summary procedure for contempt is subject to the requirements of
    natural justice, which include affording the parties an opportunity to make
    representations about an appropriate sentence following a finding of contempt: <em>R.
    v. Arradi</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2003 SCC 23, [2003] 1
    S.C.R. 280</span></em>, at para. 30. The trial judge erred by failing to give
    the appellant such an opportunity. In light of that error, it falls to this
    court to consider what sanction is fit in the circumstances.</span></p>

    to provide further submissions on sentence. Counsel filed a joint letter
    stating that in the event the court dismissed the appeal against conviction,
    there is a basis to conclude that an absolute discharge is in the appellant’s
    best interests and not contrary to the public interest. The Crown does not
    oppose a discharge. Counsel also advised that should the court grant a
    discharge, the Crown would be content if the court simply mentioned the trial judge’s
    referral to the Law Society in its decision and allow the Law Society
    investigation to take its course.</span></p>
