  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on October 20, 2008

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In 2008, the appellant, Erich Chemama, was
    convicted of counseling the complainant, Andria Pacheco, to commit the
    indictable offence of perjury and attempting to obstruct the course of justice
    by offering her money to change her testimony at one of his trials. His
    sentence of five years’ imprisonment was reduced on appeal to time served: 2009
    ONCA 249.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The appellant now appeals his conviction. The
    appellant was self-represented during much, but not all, of his trial. On
    appeal, the appellant chose not to make any submissions, but the court has
    received the benefit of very helpful submissions from </span><em><span

line-height:150%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'> contends the trial judge
    erred in refusing to discharge appellant’s second counsel notwithstanding a
    complete break-down in the solicitor-client relationship. Both errors, </span><em><span

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> submits, resulted in an unfair trial.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>I would grant the appeal, set aside the
    conviction, and direct a new trial. Although I do not accept the submission that
    the trial judge failed to provide reasonable assistance to the appellant on the
    five matters identified by </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;

    judge erred in forcing counsel on an unwilling accused, resulting in an unfair
    trial. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The complainant had been a passenger in a car
    driven by the appellant when it was stopped by the police. The appellant was on
    bail at the time, with a house arrest condition. The appellant maintained he
    was on the way to the hospital, an exception to his house arrest condition. He
    was charged with failure to comply.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>According to the complainant, who was to be a
    Crown witness at the appellant’s trial on the failure to comply charge, prior
    to trial she received two phone calls from the appellant, and a third from the
    appellant and a female, offering her money to lie to the police about the
    purpose of the car trip.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>At the trial on the subject charges, the
    appellant tried to advance the defence the call to the complainant never occurred
    because he was in custody at the time, the institution at which he was
    incarcerated only allowed inmates to make collect calls, and the complainant
    testified she did not accept collect calls.</span></p>

    fairness to Mr. Morton, his working file for the trial, including his trial
    notes and research, had been removed from his office without permission. As
    well, as he emphasized several times to the trial judge, he had not been able
    to obtain instructions from the appellant about his defence. Although Mr.
    Morton faced challenging circumstances, he discharged the duties imposed on him
    by the trial judge in a highly professional manner. Mr. Morton acted in the
    finest traditions of the Bar.</span></p>

    trial judge had heard the appellant advance his defence theory of lack of
    opportunity as early as the complainant’s evidence, yet the trial judge made no
    reference to it whatsoever in his reasons convicting the appellant. The trial
    judge simply concluded: “[The complainant’s] answers rang true. In my view Mr.
    Chemama is outright lying when he denies the fateful phone call he made.” The
    trial judge failed to address the defence theory the appellant had been
    developing throughout the trial.</span></p>

    file as it neared its end, had limited opportunity to come up to speed, and informed
    the court he had not been able to obtain instructions from the appellant about
    his defence. </span></p>

    the alternative to discharging counsel was not the prospect envisioned by the
    trial judge when, during the course of submissions on Mr. Morton’s motion to
    step down, the trial judge queried: “My question is, assuming that [counsel is
    discharged], where do we go from here? More adjournments, and adjournments, and
    adjournments, is that what we are doing?” When Mr. Morton moved to get off the
    record, the trial had long passed the point where the trial judge was required
    to accommodate further adjournment requests by the appellant. By that point in
    time, the trial judge was entitled to require the appellant to present his own defence,
    if that was his election, adduce only relevant evidence in his defence, and
    limit his closing submissions to relevant matters. The trial judge possessed
    the necessary trial management powers to keep the appellant’s evidence and
    submissions within proper bounds and time limits. Trial judges are not
    powerless in the face of difficult self-represented accused, even ones like the
    appellant whose courtroom misconduct lies at an extreme end of the spectrum.</span></p>

    it in his reasons.</span></p>
