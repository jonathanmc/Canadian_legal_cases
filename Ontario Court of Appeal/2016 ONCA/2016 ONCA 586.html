  <p>On appeal from the order of Justice Paul U. Rivard of the
    Superior Court of Justice, dated April 7, 2015.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Epstein J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The respondent, Rob
    Szalas, owns a Doberman Pinscher. The dog bit people on a number of occasions.
    After the fourth bite incident, Dr. Jim Chirico, Medical Health Officer, North
    Bay Parry Sound District Health Unit, ordered Mr. Szalas to relinquish the dog
    to the North Bay Humane Society (the “Humane Society”) to be euthanized (the “Euthanasia
    Order”). Mr. Szalas appealed the order and sought a stay. On consent, an
    interim order was made, (the “Consent Interim Order”) allowing Mr. Szalas to
    keep the dog with him pending the appeal. The order was subject to certain
    conditions designed to keep the public safe from the dog’s aggression. Mr.
    Szalas was alleged to have breached the more serious of these conditions and,
    pursuant to the provisions of the Consent Interim Order, was required to turn
    the dog over to the Humane Society. Mr. Szalas refused to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A further interim
    order (the “Interim Order”) was made, giving Mr. Szalas a deadline for the
    return of the dog and providing that failure to comply with the deadline would
    result in the dismissal of his appeal. Mr. Szalas failed to comply with the
    deadline. His appeal of the Euthanasia Order was dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>A representative of
    the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (the “SPCA”) came to Mr.
    Szalas’ residence to retrieve the dog to put it down. Mr. Szalas again refused
    to relinquish the dog. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The appellant brought
    a motion for contempt of the Euthanasia Order. The motion judge held that the
    evidence did not support a finding that Mr. Szalas failed to comply with the
    specific term relating to his obligation to relinquish the dog to the Humane
    Society, and dismissed the motion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>On appeal, Dr.
    Chirico submits that the motion judge erred by taking a formalistic approach to
    the issue of whether Mr. Szalas complied with the terms of the Euthanasia
    Order. Dr. Chirico argues that Mr. Szalas should be found in contempt for
    failure to comply with the intent of the order when he refused to turn the dog
    over to the SPCA. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Mr. Szalas moves to
    quash the appeal on the basis that the order dismissing the motion for contempt
    is interlocutory and accordingly this court lacks jurisdiction. If this court
    finds that it does have jurisdiction, Mr. Szalas submits that, on this record,
    there is no reason to interfere with the motion judge’s conclusion that, given
    the wording of the Euthanasia Order, a finding of contempt is unavailable.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>For the reasons that
    follow, I am of the view that the order under appeal is final and therefore
    this court has jurisdiction. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I am also of the view
    that the motion judge erred by failing to appreciate that an order for contempt
    is available where the evidence supports a finding that the alleged contemnor
    failed to follow the spirit of the order. By not giving up possession of his
    dog to be euthanized, Mr. Szalas did just that. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I would therefore
    allow the appeal, find Mr. Szalas in contempt and remit the matter back to a
    local judge of the Superior Court, other than the motion judge, to permit Mr.
    Szalas to attempt to purge his contempt and then to determine the appropriate
    sanction.</span></p>
  <h4><span style='line-height:200%'>BACKGROUND
    IN BRIEF</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Between February 22,
    2013 and October 14, 2014, the dog bit four individuals. The bites were
    unprovoked. An order relating to each bite incident was served on Mr. Szalas. These
    orders required the dog to be quarantined for a period of time. Mr. Szalas did
    not appeal the orders. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Based on these
    orders, it was determined that the dog was a health hazard within the meaning
    of s. 1(1) of the </span><em>Health Protection and Promotion Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.7
    (the “HPPA”). As a result, on October 30, 2014, Dr. Chirico signed the
    Euthanasia Order under s. 13 of the HPPA. The order required Mr. Szalas to
    “relinquish the [dog] to the [Humane Society] to be euthanized”. On the same
    day Dr. Chirico asked the Humane Society to “seize and destroy” the animal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Mr. Szalas surrendered
    his dog to the Humane Society and appealed the Euthanasia Order. On December
    18, 2014, Mr. Szalas and Dr. Chirico entered into the Consent Interim Order. This
    order provided, among other things, that pending the appeal the dog would be
    released to Mr. Szalas to be kept in his residence at all times except for
    three walks per day during scheduled time periods and during which the dog
    would be on a leash and muzzled. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Paragraph 12 of the
    Consent Interim Order provided that if a minor breach was proven, such as if
    the dog were being walked during an unauthorized time, the dog was to be
    returned to the Humane Society. However, in such circumstances, the appeal from
    the Euthanasia Order would still be heard notwithstanding the breach. The dog
    would be confined pending the hearing before the Board unless the motion
    alleging the breach was dismissed. In such case, the dog would be returned to
    Mr. Szalas pending the Board’s hearing of the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Paragraph 13 of the
    Consent Interim Order dealt with more serious breaches such as the dog being at
    large without a leash and without a muzzle. In the event that such a breach
    were proven, Mr. Szalas’ appeal would be dismissed and the dog would be
    destroyed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The terms of the
    Consent Interim Order were approved by the Health Services Appeal and Review
    Board (the “Board”) and incorporated into an “Order for Stay” dated December
    19, 2014.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>On December 22, 2014,
    the dog was observed with Mr. Szalas in a store in North Bay. The dog was not
    on a leash and was not muzzled. The person who saw the dog took photographs of
    the dog and provided them to Dr. Chirico, together with a sworn affidavit
    detailing what she saw. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Dr. Chirico requested
    the return of the dog pending the determination of whether the Consent Interim
    Order had been breached. Mr. Szalas refused to give up his dog. In fact he had arranged

style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>As a result of Mr.
    Szalas’ failure to turn over the dog, the Board made the Interim Order on
    December 31, 2014 requiring Mr. Szalas to “immediately return and/or surrender
    the dog to the care of the [Humane Society or the SPCA]”. The order provided
    that failure to “surrender the dog by 12:00 noon on January 2, 2015 may result
    in the dismissal of [Mr. Szalas’ appeal]”. At the request of Mr. Szalas’ then
    lawyer, the Interim Order was later amended to require the dog’s return no
    later than noon on January 3, 2015 (the “Amending Order”). </span></p>

    surrender the dog in accordance with the Amending Order. As a result, on
    January 9, 2015, the Board ordered that Mr. Szalas’ appeal be dismissed (the
    “Dismissal Order”). The Dismissal Order was served on Mr. Szalas on January 13,
    2015. Mr. Szalas was also put on notice that failure to return the dog would
    result in the enforcement of the Euthanasia Order and a motion for contempt. </span></p>

    found that he had no doubt that Mr. Szalas “was behaving in a wilful and
    deliberate way when he sent the dog to the States, as he alleges, and he did it
    to – so as to avoid complying with the [Euthanasia Order]”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>However, the motion
    judge found that the order was clear that Mr. Szalas was required “to
    relinquish his dog to the [Humane Society]”. He held that there was “no
    evidence before the Court that [Mr. Szalas] was ever asked by the Humane
    Society to relinquish his dog.” Rather, there “was one approach made to him to
    relinquish his dog, but that was by the [SPCA]”. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>The motion judge
    reasoned that as there had “not been proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.

    in <em>Roblin v. Drake</em> [1938] O.R. 711, we are all of the view that the

    in these proceedings; in other words, to use the language of Mr. Justice Middleton
    in the Hendrickson case, &quot;the very subject matter of the litigation&quot;.
    It does not deal with a collateral matter as that term is used in cases. <u>The
    order is not one which might be said to be a decision made during the course of
    proceedings but rather is one which finally disposes of the rights of the
    appellant to enforce the award which it claims to be entitled to enforce</u> and we have come to that conclusion without taking into account what other

    effectually dispose of the question. Moreover the facts of the case plainly
    show that the order is final and not interlocutory. The respondents are not
    parties to the action; <u>no proceedings are taken against them except one to
    stop their interfering with the plaintiff's business</u>; the order appealed

style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>, 2014 ONCA 656, at
    para. 8. That party cannot be permitted to “hide behind a restrictive and

style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I will first deal
    with Mr. Szalas’ argument that he complied with the Euthanasia Order by
    relinquishing the dog to the Humane Society prior to entering into the Consent
    Interim Order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>It is true that Mr.
    Szalas did initially comply with the Euthanasia Order by turning the dog over
    to the Humane Society. However, that compliance does not immunize Mr. Szalas
    from the consequences of breaches of subsequent interim orders. Those breaches
    had the effect of reinstating Mr. Szalas’ obligations under the Euthanasia
    Order. This required Mr. Szalas to relinquish the dog. His failure to do so was
    properly the subject of Dr. Chirico’s motion for contempt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I will next deal with
    the broader question of Mr. Szalas’ compliance with the letter and spirit of
    the Euthanasia Order.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>With respect, I am of
    the view that the motion judge erred in approaching the motion for contempt in
    the narrow fashion that he did. As set out above, this court has rejected such
    a formalistic approach. Simply put, the days are long gone when someone subject
    to a court order can get away with circumventing it by relying on a benign
    technicality. To allow that to happen would be disrespectful of the order and
    of the administration of justice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'> The Euthanasia Order
    was clear. Mr. Szalas had to give up his dog to be put down.  The precise
    modality – either by the Humane Society or the SPCA – was unimportant.  Despite
    the clarity of the intent of the order, Mr. Szalas did not bring the dog to the
    Humane Society to have it euthanized. He did not relinquish the dog to the SPCA
    when they attended at his home. As Dr. Chirico put it – under any
    interpretation of the order, Mr. Szalas failed to comply with it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>In my view the motion
    judge erred by not finding contempt despite concluding that Mr. Szalas’ intent
    was to frustrate the intent of the Euthanasia Order, which was to arrange for
    the dog to be destroyed in order to protect the public. Mr. Szalas did in fact
    frustrate the order by having the dog moved out of the country. And Mr. Szalas’
    conduct throughout, including his secreting the dog out of the reach of the
    authorities and then relying on a literal and narrow interpretation to avoid
    being held to account, displayed an utter disregard for the intent of the
    Euthanasia Order. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>I would add that
    while Dr. Chirico only relied on the Euthanasia Order in support of his motion
    for contempt, in my view Mr. Szalas demonstrated blatant contempt for the administration
    of justice by ignoring repeated orders and demands to surrender the dog. </span></p>

    would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the motion judge. I would
    find Mr. Szalas in contempt and remit the matter back to a local judge of the
    Superior Court to allow him to attempt to purge his contempt and to determine
    the appropriate sanction.</span></p>

    Columbia Court of Appeal in argument; however, the approach in British Columbia
    differs from that in Ontario. In my opinion, this province’s jurisprudence is
    sufficient to establish that the order in question is final.</p>
