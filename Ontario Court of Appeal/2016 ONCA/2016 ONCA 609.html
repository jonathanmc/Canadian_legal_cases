    ONSC 4264, 51 C.C.L.I. (5th) 231, allowing an appeal from the award of
    Arbitrator Kenneth J. Bialkowski, dated October 16, 2014, with reasons reported
    at (2014), 40 C.C.L.I. (5th) 323.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=FR-CA>H.S. LaForme J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Either the appellant, </span>Allstate Insurance
    Company of Canada (“Allstate”), or the respondent, Intact Insurance Company
    (“Intact”), is responsible for statutory accident benefits owed to Paula
    Chartrand and<span lang=EN-US> her two daughters (the “Claimants”) after they
    were injured in an accident on August 21, 2010. Who bears that responsibility depends
    on the answer to the central question in these proceedings: were the Claimants
    principally dependent for financial support on Kyle Houghton at the time of the
    accident?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties submitted their “priority dispute”
    to an arbitrator, who decided that the Claimants were not principally dependent
    for financial support on Kyle at the time of the accident. Therefore, Intact
    was responsible for the accident benefits. The arbitrator summarized his
    rationale as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the final analysis I find that it would be inappropriate to
    use the seven week period pre-accident, when the claimants were principally
    dependent on Kyle Houghton for financial support, <span class=Underline>as in
    my view the relationship was not one of permanence</span>. Using the
    traditional 12 month period pre-accident the claimants clearly were not
    principally financially dependent on Kyle Houghton for financial support.<span
lang=EN-US> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Intact appealed. The appeal judge concluded that
    the arbitrator had committed an error of law by importing a permanency
    requirement into the analysis and an error in principle by speculating about
    future events. Because of these errors, the appeal judge reviewed the
    arbitrator’s decision on a correctness standard of review, set aside his
    decision, and concluded that Allstate was responsible for paying the accident
    benefits owed to the Claimants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Allstate sought and obtained leave to appeal to
    this court. It argues that the appeal judge erred by reviewing the arbitrator’s
    decision on a correctness standard and that the arbitrator’s decision should be
    restored because it was reasonable. Intact resists both arguments and submits
    that the appeal judge did not err by setting aside the arbitrator’s decision.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal. Although the appeal judge erred by reviewing the arbitrator’s decision
    on a correctness standard, the arbitrator’s decision was an unreasonable one
    and, therefore, should not be restored. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The relationship between Paula and Kyle forms
    the factual background for this priority dispute. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Until January 2010, Paula was living in Sudbury,
    Ontario, with her husband, Yvan Restoule, and her two daughters, Destiny
    Chartrand and Athena Restoule. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January or February 2010, Paula began working
    at the Triple Play Sports Bar in Sarnia, Ontario. She met and began dating Kyle
    at the same time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Between February and June 2010, Paula would
    spend three weeks of each month in Sarnia. She would spend the remaining week in
    Sudbury with Yvan and her daughters at their apartment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Paula decided to leave Yvan and move to Sarnia
    with her daughters in June 2010. In early July, Paula asked her mother to drive
    her and her daughters from Sudbury to Parry Sound where they met Kyle at a gas
    station. They transferred their belongings to Kyle’s vehicle, including their
    clothes, toys, blankets, and sheets. Kyle brought the Claimants back to his
    house in Sarnia. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence indicated that the move was
    intended to be a permanent one. Yvan testified that his relationship with Paula
    had been deteriorating for a while, and that she told him that she would be
    leaving him and permanently moving to Sarnia with her daughters. Paula’s mother
    said that she thought the move was a permanent one. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Kyle acknowledged, as noted by the arbitrator,
    that he did not know if his relationship with Paula would survive and said that
    “you hope for the best and expect the worst”. Essentially Kyle was
    acknowledging that he could not predict what would happen in the future,
    especially given that his relationship with Paula had started only recently.
    However, on the whole, his evidence also confirmed that the Claimants’ move was
    intended to be a permanent one. According to Kyle, the plan was that Athena and
    Destiny would be enrolled in school in Sarnia in September and that Paula would
    look for a job at that time. There was some discussion of Paula and Kyle
    getting married as well. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After their move to Sarnia, Kyle was responsible
    for most of the Claimants’ expenses as Paula was not contributing to household
    expenses or paying any of the bills. She would occasionally buy some groceries
    or alcohol, or would pay for a dinner. During the seven weeks after the move
    and before the accident, Kyle paid for at least 64 percent of the Claimants’
    financial needs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On August 18, 2010, Paula’s friend drove the
    Claimants to Canada’s Wonderland and then </span><span lang=EN-GB>to Sudbury, to
    visit Paula’s mother and to retrieve the rest of their belongings</span><span
lang=EN-US>. On their way back to Sarnia, on August 21, 2010, they were
    involved in an accident. Paula suffered relatively minor injuries, but Destiny
    and Athena sustained catastrophic injuries.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Claimants applied for and received accident
    benefits from Intact, the insurer of the vehicle they were riding in at the
    time of the accident. However, Intact argued that Allstate, who insured two
    vehicles owned by Kyle, should pay those benefits. Intact took the position
    that Allstate was obligated to pay because the Claimants were dependent on Kyle
    at the time of the accident and, consequently, they were insureds under
    Allstate’s policies with Kyle. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Legal framework</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Section 268 of the </span><em>Insurance Act</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. I-8, deals with statutory accident benefits in motor vehicle
    liability policies. Section 268(1) provides that every such policy “shall be
    deemed to provide for…statutory accident benefits”.  For cases where an
    individual might seek benefits under more than one policy, s. 268(2) sets out
    priority rules. As the Claimants were occupants of a vehicle at the time of the
    accident, the following rules apply: </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(i)      the occupant has
    recourse against the insurer of an automobile in respect of which the occupant
    is an insured;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(ii)      if recovery is
    unavailable under (i), the occupant has recourse against the insurer of the
    automobile in which he or she was an occupant;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(iii)     if recovery is
    unavailable under (i) or (ii), the occupant has recourse against the insurer of
    any other automobile involved in the accident from which the entitlement to
    statutory accident benefits arose; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(iv)     if recovery is
    unavailable under (i), (ii) or (iii), the occupant has recourse against the
    Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Section 2(1)</span><span
lang=EN-US> of the </span><em>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule – Accidents
    on or after November 1, 1996</em><span lang=EN-US>, O. Reg. 403/96 (“</span><em>SABS</em><span
lang=EN-US>”), provides that “any dependant of the named insured” is an
    “insured person” for any motor vehicle policy. Section 2(6) of the same
    regulation provides that a person is dependent on another “</span>if the person
    is principally dependent for financial support…on the other person”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
    relevant for this appeal is <em>Disputes Between Insurers</em>, O. Reg. 283/95
    (the “Regulation”). It provides that all disputes under s. 268 shall be settled
    through arbitration conducted in accordance with the <em>Arbitration Act, 1991</em>,
    S.O. 1991, c. 17. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section<span
lang=EN-US> 45 of the </span><em>Arbitration Act, 1991</em><span lang=EN-US> provides that, presumptively, parties can appeal only on points of law with
    leave. However, the parties can provide for broader rights of appeal in their
    arbitration agreement. In this case, Allstate and Intact agreed that either
    could “appeal the Arbitrator’s decision on a point or points of law or mixed
    fact and law” to a judge of the Superior Court of Justice. </span></p>
  <h1>III.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issues on appeal </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Intact
    argues that the appeal judge erred by (i) reviewing the arbitrator’s decision for
    correctness; and (ii) setting aside the arbitrator’s decision even though it
    was reasonable. As noted, I accept the first argument but not the second. I
    will first address the standard of review. Then I will explain why the
    arbitrator’s decision was unreasonable. </p>
  <h1>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties’ disagreement is founded upon their conflicting characterization of the
    question before the appeal judge. Allstate argues that determining dependency
    for purposes of <em>SABS </em>is a mixed fact and law exercise and, therefore,
    the appeal judge should have applied a deferential standard of review. Intact,
    on the other hand, insists that the arbitrator committed an extricable legal
    error and so his decision was properly reviewed on a correctness standard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    approach this question in a different way than the parties. As the choice of
    standard of review is a question of law, this court is not bound by the
    parties’ positions and must determine the correct standard of review: <em>Monsanto
    Canada Inc. v. Ontario (Superintendent of Financial Services)</em>, 2004 SCC
    54, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 152, at para. 6.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin by considering the framework for choosing the appropriate standard of
    review. Then I will apply that framework to determine the standard of review
    that should be applied by this court and the one that should have been applied
    by the appeal judge.  </p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Framework for Determining the Standard of Review</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are two different frameworks for
    determining the standard of review on an appeal: </span><span lang=EN-GB>(i) </span><span
lang=EN-US>the “appellate” framework articulated in </span><em>Housen v.
    Nikolaisen</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; and (ii) </span>the
    “administrative law” framework associated with <em>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</em>,
    2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190. </p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[a]lthough the selection of the tribunal is

    jurisdiction over the same legal question at the first instance: </span><em>McLean</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Then, turning to the jurisprudence he considered
    relevant, the arbitrator observed that courts and arbitrators have struggled
    when asked to determine financial dependency in cases involving new
    relationships or relationships that have experienced a significant change in
    the recent past. The arbitrator acknowledged that other arbitrators and courts
    had considered a short time frame in some cases. The arbitrator thought that
    there was a rule or principle that he could draw from these cases:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The common theme through these cases where a
    short time frame was considered appears to be that each arbitrator wrestled
    with the question as to whether the relationship existing during that period
    was of permanence and likely to continue into the future or was it
    transitional. The same analysis must be done here.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Then the arbitrator made the following
    conclusion as to the time frame in which to consider whether the Claimants were
    financially dependent on Kyle: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>On the evidence before me Intact has failed to satisfy the onus
    upon it to establish the relationship between [Kyle] and [Paula] was on the
    balance of probability likely to be permanent. As a result I find that a seven
    week time frame for the analysis of financial dependency is inappropriate. Accordingly,
    one must look at the “big picture”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After looking at the “big picture”, the arbitrator
    concluded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>What we have here is a case complicated by
    relationships involving people on the fringe of society, stripping,
    prostitution, addiction, depression, criminality and CAS involvement. There is
    no hallmark of stability. The closest thing to stability is Paula’s on and off
    relationship (mainly on) with [Yvan]. This would encompass a period of several
    years and certainly the better part of the 12-month period pre-accident. In my
    view this better represents the &quot;big picture&quot; and true nature of the
    relationship. Paula and Yvan had separated before but Paula returned. During
    the 12 month period pre-accident that I have chosen as the appropriate
    timeframe for analysis the three claimants were </span><span class=Underline>not</span><span
lang=EN-US> principally dependent for financial support on Kyle. [Emphasis in
    original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I note that the parties disagree on exactly what the arbitrator
    did in this case. Allstate argues that he looked at all of the evidence and
    came to a decision about the appropriate timeframe based on the facts as a
    whole. Intact, on the other hands, submits that he created a permanency
    requirement and that this was the only basis for his decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with Intact’s characterization of the decision. As noted,
    the arbitrator chose the year-long period solely because, in his view, <span
lang=EN-US>“</span>it would be inappropriate to use the seven week period
    pre-accident…as…the relationship was not one of permanence.” Therefore, it is
    that rationale and the resulting outcome that must be reviewed for
    reasonableness. </p>

  <p class=CQuote>The law with respect to dependency cases has evolved over the
    past two decades to recognize the challenges associated with applying the
    dependency principle to real life fact situations. Amongst the most challenging
    situations are those where the recent pre-accident history shows a changing
    environment. The case law calls for us to identify a time period for the
    purpose of evaluating dependency. It is often not useful, or even sometimes
    misleading, to look at circumstances in too narrow a time frame (often referred
    to as a “snapshot”). To arrive at an appropriate determination of dependency
    status, we have to look at the status of a person's needs and resources over a
    time period. Then, within a selected timeframe, we can approach the issue of
    financial needs and resources in order to determine the person's dependency
    status.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>How did the arbitrator respond to this challenge
    in this case? He responded, based on his review of the jurisprudence, by creating
    and applying a “permanence” test. Specifically, the arbitrator concluded that
    he should accept a “short” time frame only in cases where the relationship at
    issue is likely permanent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That approach conflicts with the legal
    principles laid down in the jurisprudence. It is well established that, when
    conducting a dependency analysis, the arbitrator was required to look at the
    relationship between the Claimants and Kyle during a “period of time which
    fairly reflects the status of the parties </span><span class=Underline>at the
    time of the accident</span><span lang=EN-US>” (emphasis added): </span><em>Oxford
    Mutual</em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 26-27; see also </span><em>Dominion of
    Canada</em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 29-31; </span><em>Gore Mutual Insurance
    Co. v. Co-operators General Insurance Co.</em><span lang=EN-US> (2008), 93 O.R.
    (3d) 234 (S.C.), at para. 8. The time period chosen for a dependency analysis must
    reflect the facts of the case: </span><em>Oxford Mutual</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    at para. 26. Simply put, the jurisprudence has rejected a categorical or
    one-size-fits-all approach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In contrast the arbitrator carved out the
    category of “transient” or “recent” relationships and created a permanence
    requirement for all of them. Then the arbitrator relied on his conclusion that
    the relationship between Paula and Kyle was unlikely to succeed when choosing a
    one-year time period over a seven-week time period. Reading the arbitrator’s
    decision, it is clear that this is the only reason why he chose a year-long
    period where the Claimants were not dependent on Kyle over a seven-week period where
    they were. In my view, the arbitrator applied a categorical approach. This
    approach is unreasonable because it is inconsistent with the applicable legal
    principles and is simply too divorced from the actual question: what time
    period accurately reflects the true nature of the particular relationship at
    issue at the time of the accident?</span></p>

    been deteriorating for some time and Paula said she was leaving him in June
    2010. At this time, Paula had been dating Kyle for a few months and spent most
    of her time in Sarnia, with him. In July 2010, she moved her two daughters to
    Sarnia to live with Kyle. All of the witnesses who provided evidence (Kyle,
    Yvan, and Paula’s mother) indicated that this move was intended to be a
    permanent one. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Significantly, the evidence indicates that Kyle
    and Paula believed that they were building a real relationship. They had a plan
    to enroll Athena and Destiny in a school in Sarnia. Paula was supposed to find
    a new job to help support this new household. There was even some talk of Paula
    and Kyle getting married. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During the seven weeks after the move, while

    needs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I read his decision, the arbitrator did not
    question and largely accepted all of that evidence. However, he chose to focus
    on something else. He chose to focus on the permanence of the Paula-Kyle
    relationship. And he concluded that this relationship was unlikely to survive
    based on his conclusion about the kind of person Paula was. He focused on
    Paula’s psyche and the fact that she was a troubled woman, the fact that she
    was not completely honest with Kyle, and his conclusion that the Paula-Yvan
    relationship was a more stable feature of her life. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are at least two problems with such an

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, it is difficult to see how any of these
    facts shed any light on the nature of the Claimants’ relationship with Kyle at
    the time of the accident. The uncontroverted evidence was that the move was
    intended to be a permanent one and that Kyle was contributing the vast majority
    of the expenses of this new household. The odds of Paula and Kyle’s
    relationship surviving into the future has very little to do with whether the
    Claimants were principally dependent for financial support on Kyle at the time
    of the accident. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the arbitrator did not have any evidence
    suggesting that anyone saw Paula and Kyle’s relationship as temporary. The arbitrator’s
    conclusion to the contrary was based on his assessment of Paula’s psyche and
    his conclusion based on what the arbitrator knew about Paula’s past life.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This analysis is simply too speculative and

    mug’s game.” There are simply too many variables at play and it is extremely
    doubtful that any decision maker can predict the future course of a
    relationship in the way the arbitrator purported to. Because that analysis was
