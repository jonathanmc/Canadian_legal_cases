  <p class=Heading><strong>Hourigan J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>Overview</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are two appeals before the court. They
    arise in the context of a putative class action where the representative
    plaintiff, Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology (Fanshawe),
    asserts that it and other members of the proposed class were victims of a price-fixing
    conspiracy in the liquid crystal display (LCD) industry. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the first appeal, the defendant HannStar
    Display Corporation (HannStar) appeals the order of the motion judge
    dismissing its motion for summary judgment (the HannStar Appeal). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the second appeal, Fanshawe appeals the order
    of the motion judge dismissing its motion for leave to amend the statement of
    claim (the Fanshawe Appeal).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    HannStar appeal and grant the Fanshawe Appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Background Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On December 13, 2006, news agencies around the
    world reported that various LCD manufacturers were being investigated regarding
    allegations of price-fixing in their industry. Media coverage of the
    investigations continued throughout 2007. Various class actions in the United
    States followed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first proposed class action in Canada
    alleging price-fixing in the LCD industry was commenced in British Columbia on
    March 6, 2007. AU Optronics Corporation (AU) and HannStar, among others, were
    named as defendants. Both AU and HannStar are Taiwanese corporations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In Ontario, the Siskinds law firm commenced a
    class action on May 2, 2007 (the First Ontario Action). None of the
    defendants in the First Ontario Action was based in Taiwan. However, AU and HannStar,
    among others, were named in the body of the statement of claim as alleged
    co-conspirators. Siskinds says that the Taiwanese companies were not made
    defendants because they did not want to impede the progress of the action while
    service in Taiwan was being effected.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Over two years later, on July 20, 2009, this
    action was commenced against various Taiwanese corporations, with Fanshawe
    serving as the proposed representative plaintiff.  AU and HannStar were named
    as defendants. In this action, Fanshawe asserts a claim in civil conspiracy and
    a claim pursuant to s. 36 of the <em>Competition Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-34, predicated on a breach of s. 45 of the Act, the provision that makes
    conspiracies to fix prices illegal. The conspiracy period was alleged to be
    from January 1, 1998 to December 11, 2006.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>AU and HannStar brought a motion for summary
    judgment, asserting that the action was time-barred pursuant to the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002, c.&nbsp;24, Sched. B, and pursuant to s. 36(4)(a) of
    the <em>Competition Act</em> and was an abuse of process. The parties filed
    affidavit material on the motion. Fanshawe also served a motion to amend its
    claim, including amendments to add MASS Engineered Design Inc. (Mass) as
    another representative plaintiff.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In an affidavit filed on behalf of Fanshawe in
    the summary judgment motion, David Smith, Fanshawes Manager of Retail
    Services, swore that Fanshawe became aware of a potential claim in January 2008
    when a lawyer at Siskinds retained on unrelated matters informed Fanshawe that
    it might have been impacted by the alleged conspiracy. Fanshawe retained
    Siskinds on January 24, 2008 to pursue the litigation on its behalf. However,
    during his cross-examination on his affidavit, Mr. Smith testified that Fanshawe
    first had discussions about this litigation with Siskinds in the spring of 2007,
    more than two years before July 2009 when the action was commenced. After the cross-examination,
    Fanshawe brought a motion to file a supplementary affidavit clarifying the
    timing of the initial discussions with Siskinds.  The motion judge denied that
    motion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion for summary judgment was heard on
    November 13, 2014, and was dismissed in written reasons released on March 31,
    2015. With respect to the civil conspiracy claim, the motion judge ruled that Fanshawes
    evidence demonstrated that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial as to
    whether the presumption of knowledge set forth in s. 5(2) of the <em>Limitations
    Act </em>had been rebutted. He concluded that there was not sufficient clarity
    in the evidence regarding </span><span lang=EN-US>whether Fanshawe knew or
    ought to have known of the elements set forth in s. 5(1)(a) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Limitations Act </span></em><span lang=EN-US>t</span><span
lang=EN-US>o make a dispositive finding </span><span lang=EN-US>based on the
    evidence before him. </span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge also found that
    the discoverability rule applies to the limitation period in s. 36(4)(a) of the <em>Competition Act</em>. Finally, he held that commencing this action more
    than two years after the Ontario Action, an action involving the same putative
    class and alleged co-conspirators, was not an abuse of process.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion for leave to amend the statement of
    claim in this action was heard on February 27, 2015, and was dismissed in
    written reasons dated May 28, 2015. The motion judge denied leave to amend on
    the basis that the amendments constituted an expansion of the claims asserted
    and were statute-barred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fanshawe commenced an appeal in this court. AU
    and HannStar also brought an appeal to this court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In an endorsement dated November 24, 2015, this
    court quashed AU and HannStars appeal on the basis that the order below is
    interlocutory and, therefore, leave must be sought for the appeal to be heard
    by Divisional Court. Fanshawe conceded that nothing in the order dismissing the
    motion for summary judgment, or in the reasons of the motion judge in support
    of that order, precludes AU and HannStar from advancing at trial their
    arguments regarding s.&nbsp;36(4) of the <em>Competition Act </em>or abuse of
    process as substantive defences or otherwise: <em>Fanshawe College of Applied
    Arts and Technology v. AU Optronics Corporation</em>, 2015 ONCA 808, at para.
    1. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>AU and HannStar then brought a motion in writing
    in Divisional Court for leave to appeal the order of the motion judge
    dismissing the summary judgment motion to that court. Rady J. granted leave to
    appeal. As I will discuss below, there is some confusion regarding the scope of
    her order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties then argued two motions in this
    court before Huscroft J.A. AU and HannStar brought a motion to consolidate the
    HannStar Appeal with the Fanshawe Appeal. That motion was granted. Fanshawe
    brought a motion to strike paragraphs in AUs and HannStars factums in the
    Fanshawe Appeal on the basis that the factums raised issues that went beyond
    the scope of the motion judges reasons. That motion was dismissed. However,
    Fanshawe was granted leave to file a reply factum on the additional issue raised
    by the respondents in the Fanshawe Appeal: whether a breach of s. 45 of the <em>Competition
    Act</em> can serve as the unlawful means in a civil conspiracy claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prior to the hearing of the appeals, AU entered
    into a settlement agreement with Fanshawe. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issues raised on these appeals and my conclusions
    on each issue may be summarized as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong>(i) Does this court have the jurisdiction
    to consider the appeal of the motion judges ruling that there is a genuine
    issue for trial regarding whether the limitation period has expired for the civil
    conspiracy claim?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst style='line-height:normal'>No. The
    order was interlocutory. An appeal lay to the Divisional Court with leave. On
    the motion for leave, the motion judge granted leave on the sole issue of
    whether the discoverability principle applied to s. 36(4)(a)(i) of the <i>Competition
    Act</i>. Huscroft J.A. ordered that the Fanshawe Appeal and the HannStar Appeal
    be heard together in this court. He only had jurisdiction to combine the
    Fanshawe Appeal with what was pending in the Divisional Court. Because leave
    had not been granted on the issue of the expiry of the limitation period for
    the conspiracy claim, that issue could not be combined with the Fanshawe Appeal.
    Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the motion judges
    ruling on that issue.</p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong>(ii) Did the motion judge err
    in finding that the discoverability principle applies to the limitation period
    found in s. 36(4)(a)(i) of the Competition Act?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst style='line-height:normal'>No. Subsection
    36(4)(a)(i) is subject to the discoverability principle. A statutory limitation
    period will generally be subject to the discoverability principle when the
    running of the limitation period is linked either to the plaintiffs knowledge
    about an event or to an event related to the plaintiffs cause of action. The
    limitation period in s. 36(4)(a)(i) is triggered by an event related to the
    underlying cause of action  specifically, conduct contrary to Part VI of the <i>Competition
    Act</i>. Therefore, it is subject to discoverability.  </p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong>(iii) Did the trial judge err
    in refusing to grant leave to amend the statement of claim?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle style='line-height:normal'>Yes.
    The motion judge erroneously concluded that the proposed amendments to the
    statement of claim had the effect of broadening the subject matter of the claim
    from LCD products to LCD products and LCD panels. In fact, both items were
    always part of the claim. The motion judge erred, therefore, in refusing to grant
    leave to amend. </p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong>(iv) Is it plain and obvious
    that a breach of s. 45 of the Competition Act cannot serve as the unlawful
    means for a civil conspiracy claim?</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast style='
line-height:normal'>No. Prior to the enactment of what is now s. 36 of the <i>Competition
    Act</i>, a breach of Part VI of the Act could serve as the unlawful means in a
    civil conspiracy. If Parliament intended to take away this existing common law
    right it would have to have done so in the clearest of terms. It did not. The
    weight of appellate authority on the point, including a case from this court, supports
    the view that a breach of Part VI of the <i>Competition Act </i>may serve as
    the unlawful means in a civil conspiracy.</p>

    with counsel for HannStar whether we had jurisdiction to hear his clients
    appeal of the ruling that there was a genuine issue requiring a trial regarding
    whether Fanshawes civil conspiracy claim was statue-barred.  We heard argument
    on both this jurisdictional point and the merits of HannStars appeal on this

    procedural history. AU and HannStar first brought their appeal to this court.
    We found that the appeal was interlocutory. Therefore, the proper appeal route
    was to seek leave to appeal in the Divisional Court. AU and HannStar then
    brought a motion before a single judge of the Divisional Court, Rady J.</span></p>

    of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, she found the
    following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[7]      First however, it is important to note that the
    motions judge made no final determination with respect to the limitation
    issues. Rather, he concluded that he was unable to determine when the plaintiff
    knew of its cause of action on the strength of the record before him.  The
    issues remain live to be fully litigated either at the common issues trial or
    any trial of individual issues.  This, in my view, tends to militate against
    granting leave to appeal. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[8]      However, I am persuaded that leave should be granted
    with respect to whether discoverability applies to the limitation period in the <em>Competition Act</em>. The motions judge concluded that it did</p>

    judges analysis of the issue and the conflicting jurisprudence on the issue,
    concluding, at para. 10, that i</span><span lang=EN-US>t is apparent that
    there is conflicting authority on this issue, which the motions judge
    recognized. She then concluded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[11]    I am persuaded that it is desirable that leave be
    granted. The question of whether s. 36(4) of the <em>Competition Act</em> is
    subject to discoverability is a question of statutory interpretation that is of
    considerable importance to the competition class action bar. It appears to me
    that the law is unsettled on the point. It would therefore be helpful to have
    appellate jurisprudence on the issue. </p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately, when the order was taken out it
    provided only that leave to appeal is granted and did not specify the issue
    for which leave was granted. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The law is clear that an appeal lies from an
    order and not from the trial judges reasons for that order. For example, a
    party may not appeal an unfavourable conclusion drawn by the trial judge in his
    or her reasons that was not part of the order binding the parties:<em> Grand
    River Enterprises v. Burnham</em> (2005), 10 C.P.C. (6th) 136 (Ont. C.A.), at

    the order being appealed from, but the order defining the issues for which
    leave to appeal has been granted. A review of the order in the context of the
    reasons, makes clear that it is incompatible with its underlying rationale.
    Having reviewed the reasons, I conclude that Rady J. intended to grant leave to
    appeal on the discrete issue of whether the discoverability principle applies
    to the limitation period in s. 36(4). </span></p>

    probate or the death of a defendant. In <em>Waschkowski</em>, this court

    cause of action and the plaintiffs knowledge of the event at issue was
    irrelevant to their cause of action: <em>Ryan</em>, at para. 32; <em>Waschkowski</em>,
    at para. 8. In contrast, the conduct mentioned in s.&nbsp;36(4)(a)(i) is not

    limitation period is similar to the one at issue in the present case. There,
    the Supreme Court considered what was s. 206(1) of the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, which provided that any action for damages caused by a
    motor vehicle accident had to be brought within two years from the time when
    the damages were sustained. The court concluded that the discoverability
    principle applied. Major J.s comments, at para. 38, are instructive: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The appellant submitted here that the general rule of
    discoverability was ousted because the legislature used the words damages were
    sustained, rather than the date when the cause of action arose. It is unlikely
    that by using the words damages were sustained, the legislature intended that
    the determination of the starting point of the limitation period should take
    place without regard to the injured partys knowledge. It would require clearer
    language to displace the general rule of discoverability.  The use of the
    phrase damages were sustained rather than cause of action arose, in the
    context of the<em> HTA</em>, is a distinction without a difference. The
    discoverability rule has been applied by this Court even to statutes of
    limitation in which plain construction of the language used would appear to
    exclude the operation of the rule. <em>Kamloops, supra</em>, dealt in part with
    s. 739 of the <em>Municipal Act</em>, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 255, which required
    that notice should be given within two months from and after the date on which
    [the] damage was sustained. However, this Court applied the discoverability
    rule even with respect to this section. [Citation omitted.]</p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsection 36(4)(a)(i) links the limitation
    period to conduct that gives rise to any damage or loss. In that way, it is
    similar to the former s. 206 of the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em>, which linked
    the limitation period to damages caused by a motor vehicle accident. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Also instructive is this courts decision in <em>Grenier </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>in which </span></em>the issue was
    whether the discoverability principle applied to the old s. 258(2) of the <em>Insurance
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, which provided as follows: No action shall be
    brought against an insurer under subsection (1) after the expiration of one
    year from the final determination of the action against the insured, including
    appeals if any. At p. 722, Morden A.C.J.O. concluded that the discoverability
    principle applied: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>With respect, I do not think that the triggering event in s.&nbsp;258(2)
    of the <em>Insurance Act</em>  the final determination of the action against
    the insured  is the same as that in <em>Fehr</em>. It is a constituent element
    of the cause of action which is created by s. 258(1)  a judgment against a
    person insured by a motor vehicle liability policy. Under the discoverability
    rule this triggering event does not come into existence until the plaintiff
    has, or reasonably should have, knowledge not only that he or she has <em>a</em> judgment but, also, that it is a judgment against an insured person. [Emphasis
    in original.] </p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, in this case, the term conduct in
    s. 36(4)(a)(i) of the <em>Competition Act</em> refers to the conduct giving
    rise to damages mentioned in s.&nbsp;36(1) and is, therefore, also a
    constituent element of the cause of action subject to the limitation period. To
    use Bastarache J.s language from <em>Ryan</em>,<em> </em>quoted above, the
    triggering event is related to the accrual of the cause of action. Applying the
    rationale from <em>Grenier</em>, s. 36(4)(a)(i) too is subject to the
    discoverability principle. </span></p>

    J. stated the following: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In balancing the defendants legitimate interest in respecting
    limitations periods and the interest of the plaintiffs, the fundamental
    unfairness of requiring a plaintiff to bring a cause of action before he could reasonably
    have discovered that he had a cause of action is a compelling consideration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>In my view, that applies in the
    present case as well, particularly given that secrecy and deception are invariably
    elements of anti-competition agreements. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I note that s. 36(4)(a)(ii) provides an
    alternative date for the limitation period (i.e. the day on which any criminal
    proceedings relating to the conduct at issue were disposed of). That alternate
    event is arguably not connected to a plaintiffs cause of action or knowledge 
    at the very least it is clearly not a constituent element of the cause of
    action provided in s. 36 of the <em>Competition Act</em>. As such, it imposes a
    limitation period that is probably not subject to discoverability. One could
    argue that this produces an anomalous result in that the discoverability
    principle would apply to s. 36(4)(a)(i) but not to s. 36(4)(a)(ii). However, I
    do not think such an outcome would be anomalous. There is no rule that suggests
    that both limitation periods in s. 36(4)(a) must operate in the same way. </span></p>

    that it was not beyond doubt that the discoverability principle did not apply
    to s.&nbsp;36(4)(a)(i), he noted, at p. 206, that Parliament has hardly
    provided potential defendants with an iron-clad assurance that they may not be

    amendments:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>While LCD <u>Panels are</u> used in a variety of products, such

    stopped there, he would have granted leave to amend because they were cosmetic
    in nature and did not change the substance of the relief sought in the action.
    However, he found that the other proposed amendments went beyond mere cosmetic
    refinements of the existing language and expanded the scope of the action. In
    particular, he pointed to proposed paragraph 8, which stated [d]uring the

    expanded the scope of the action. His reasoning was as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[29]    While the words multiple-display products are not
    defined, the words televisions, computer monitors and/or laptops are not used
    in connection with Mass.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[30]    That appears to explain why the proposed pleading has
    been enlarged to allege that the defendants and others conspired to enhance
    unreasonably the prices of LCD <span class=Underline>Panels </span><em><u>and/or</u></em><u> <span class=Underline>LCD</span></u> Products and to lessen unduly competition
    in the production, manufacture, sale and/or supply of LCD <span
class=Underline>Panels </span><em><u>and/or</u></em><u> <span class=Underline>LCD </span></u>Products in North America. [Italics added]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[31]    It also explains why the proposed pleading alleges that
    Fanshawe and Mass paid more for <span class=Underline>LCD Panels</span> <em>and</em> LCD Products than would have been paid in the absence of the alleged
    conspiracy. &nbsp;[Italics added]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[32]    When read as a whole, the proposed pleading introduces
    substantive changes.&nbsp;Remedies are being sought in relation to a wider
    range of products and on behalf of a larger putative class. LCD Panels are not
    simply a sub-category of LCD Products.&nbsp; Mass is not simply an existing class
    member who is seeking to become a named plaintiff.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[33]    In fact, it does not appear that Mass is a member of
    the class described in the existing statement of claim at all.&nbsp; That means
    Mass was not under the umbrella of s. 28(1) of the [<em>Class Proceedings Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>]</span>.&nbsp; </em>The commencement of this action
    had no effect on the limitation periods relating to Mass claims. &nbsp;Those
    periods have expired.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[34]    In those circumstances, it is not appropriate to add
    Mass as a plaintiff to this action under rule 5.04(2) of the <em>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</em>.&nbsp; Given that decision there is no need for any of the
    consequential amendments. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the motion judge erred in concluding
    that Mass was not a member of the class described in the existing statement of
    claim. That claim contained language in paragraph 1(a) that made clear that the
    action sought relief for direct and indirect purchasers: a declaration that
    the Defendants conspired each with the other to raise, maintain, fix and
    stabilize the price of large panel liquid crystal display (LCD) (i.e. LCD
    panels that are 10 inches or larger, measured diagonally) and televisions,
    computer monitors and laptops containing LCD (collectively LCD Products).  Mass
    was a direct purchaser (i.e. it purchased panels, not finished products
    containing panels). </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The effect of the amendments was not to expand
    the scope of the action to include a new category of class members. Mass was
    part of the class from the outset as an indirect purchaser. Accordingly, it had
    the benefit of s. 28(1) of the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em>. The limitation
    period for its claim was tolled and there was no basis for the motion judge to
    deny the motion for leave to amend the statement of claim.</span></p>

    of the <em>Competition Act</em> provides the only available civil remedy for a

  <p class=CQuote>36&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Any person who has suffered loss or damage as
    a result of</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a)&nbsp;conduct that is contrary to any provision of Part

lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, s. 36 creates a statutory cause of action for
    any person who has suffered loss or damage arising from the breach of any of

    conspiracy (s. 45), bid-rigging (s. 47), misleading advertising (s. 52) and
    deceptive telemarketing (s.&nbsp;52.1). Available damages are restricted to
    recovering an amount equal to the loss or damage proved to have been

    It would, therefore, be contrary to the <em>Competition Act</em> and Parliaments
    intentions to permit a s. 45 breach to serve as the unlawful means in a civil

    at para. 55 of the Courts judgment in<span class=apple-converted-space><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></span><em>Watson</em>, where
    Justice Saunders reframes the question to be asked as whether the<em> Competition Act</em><span class=apple-converted-space><span style='font-size:
13.5pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></span><span class=apple-converted-space><span
style='color:black'>p</span></span>rovides &quot;a new and superior&quot;
    method of remedying a breach of the statute. With respect, the superiority of
    the new statute in providing a remedy for a breach of the statute is not the
    right interpretative question. The proper question is: Based on a reading of
    the whole statute what was Parliaments intent in introducing the statutory
    cause of action? I repeat what Justice Duff stated in <em>Orpen v. Roberts</em>, <em>supra</em> at pp. 369-370</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For the reasons expressed above, Parliaments intent was not
    constrained to replacing the existing common law means of enforcing competition
    law with a new and superior method. Parliament does not have to justify making
    its statutory cause of action the exclusive cause of action by making it
    broader and more generous or superior in some way to the common law cause of
    action. Given the policy pulls of competition law, Parliament was not
    constrained to only introduce pro-plaintiff amendments to the<em> Competition
    Act,</em><span class=apple-converted-space><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
color:black'>&nbsp;</span></span>and, in my opinion, Parliament intended to
    introduce a statutory cause of action that had a briefer limitation period and
    that did not admit of punitive damages but did offer plaintiffs a more
    efficient claim against price-fixers. As Justice Howland, noted in<span
class=apple-converted-space><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></span><em>Stephens
    v. Gulf Oil Canada Ltd.,</em><span class=apple-converted-space><span
style='font-size:13.5pt;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></span><em>supra</em>, the
    scope of the common law may be changed to the extent that Parliament determines
    that regulation is desirable in the public interest.</p>

lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the weight of appellate authority in
    this country is contrary to the position asserted by HannStar and its position
    is wrong in law. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellate authorities cited by the parties
    are, with the exception of <em>Wakelam</em>, entirely consistent with
    Fanshawes position. In <em>Apotex</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> the issue was squarely before this court and the position urged upon us by
    HannStar was rejected.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, in my view, there is no reason to
    depart from the reasoning of this court in <em>Apotex</em>, of the Manitoba
    Court of Appeal in <em>Westfair, </em>and of<em> </em>the Court of Appeal for
    British Columbia in<em> Watson.</em> There is nothing in the language of s. 36 or
    in the debates surrounding its enactment that suggests it was Parliaments
    intention to eliminate the use of a breach of Part VI of the Act as the
    unlawful means in a civil conspiracy claim. To the contrary, it would appear to
    be incongruous with the purpose of the Act, being the elimination of
    anti-competitive behaviour, that Parliament would eliminate a common law cause
    of action that serves to punish such behaviour.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The cases relied upon by HannStar that consider
    the <em>Competition Act</em> are outliers. They are not binding on this court
    and should not be followed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Barely eighteen months after it was issued, the
    application of <em>Wakelam</em> was severely restricted by the same courts
    subsequent decision in <em>Watson</em>. There is good reason for this. In <em>Wakelam</em>,
    the court took the wrong analytical approach. It relied on <em>General Motors</em>,
    which was concerned with whether the enactment of the predecessor to s. 36 was
    constitutionally valid. That was not the issue before the court in <em>Wakelam</em> and it is not the issue before this court. The issue here is whether the
    enactment eliminated an existing cause of action, i.e. civil conspiracy with a
    Part VI breach serving as the unlawful means. The court in <em>Wakelam</em> never
    considered that issue and <em>Westfair </em>and <em>Apotex</em> were not
    referenced.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>Shah</em>, the motion judge determined,
    at para. 193, that his preferred analytical approach was to begin by considering
    the issue as a matter of first principles and then analyze what the case law
    says. That approach, while unusual, is certainly acceptable. He acknowledged,
    at para. 191, that there was existing case law recognizing that a breach of
    the <em>Competition Act</em> was an unlawful act for the purposes of satisfying
    this constituent element of the tort of conspiracy. He then cites <em>Apotex</em>.
    However, in his extensive legal analysis, there is no further reference to the
    case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While it was open to the motion judge in that
    case to distinguish <em>Apotex</em>, what he could not do was ignore the dicta
    from this court. The selective nature of the analysis taints his conclusions
    and leads me to conclude that the case should not be followed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am also of the view that the motion judge in <em>Shah</em> erred in relying upon the <em>Orpen</em> line of case law. It is not applicable
    to the present case because, in those cases, the courts were considering
    statues where the legislature identified the proscribed behaviour and provided
    for a remedy at the same time. Thus, the analysis focused on whether it was the
    intention of the legislature to provide a complete code of redress. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This contrasts with the legislative history of
    the predecessor to the <em>Competition Act</em>, in which Parliament first prohibited
    certain conduct without providing a corresponding civil remedy. As discussed
    above, the common law filled the void by allowing a Part VI violation to serve
    as the unlawful means in a civil conspiracy. It was only after that remedy was
    established that the Act was amended to provide a statutory remedy. In these
    circumstances, the correct analysis is whether Parliament intended to take away
    this established remedy with the enactment of the statutory cause of action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary, I am of the view that the weight of appellate
    authority is contrary to the position espoused by HannStar and that the cases
    relied upon by HannStar are not persuasive. In these circumstances, it can
    hardly be said that the unlawful means conspiracy claim asserted in the present
    case has no chance of success.</span></p>
