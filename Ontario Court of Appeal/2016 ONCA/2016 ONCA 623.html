  <p class=Heard>Heard: March 21, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on March 8, 2013
    and the sentence imposed on October 4, 2013 by Justice C.A. Tucker of the Superior
    Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Epstein J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>On October 4, 2009, the appellant attended the
    birthday party of a three-year-old girl. The appellant carried a loaded concealed
    handgun – for protection. Tyrone Johnston, another guest at the party,
    confronted the appellant in the garage of the home where the celebration was
    taking place. The men indicated to each other that each was carrying a gun.
    Johnston left the party briefly and upon his return threatened to kill the
    appellant (the “garage incident”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span

    onto the street. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>After a short interval, the appellant followed
    Johnston to the street. He testified that he left the garage and went out to
    the street in order to calm things down with Johnston. However, the clash
    between the two men continued. Johnston screamed at the appellant that he would
    kill him and his sister. According to the appellant, Johnston moved his hand
    toward his waist – an action that the appellant interpreted as Johnston’s
    reaching for his gun – and charged at him. The appellant pulled out his gun,
    closed his eyes and fired six shots. Three hit Johnston in the back (the
    “street incident”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Johnston ran to a nearby home and collapsed. He was
    pronounced dead at the scene.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant was charged with first degree murder,
    using a firearm while committing an indictable offence, and possessing a
    prohibited weapon without a lawful excuse. He pleaded guilty to the latter
    charge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>At trial, the Crown’s theory was that when the
    appellant was in the garage he made up his mind to kill Johnston. The appellant
    went out to the street and followed through with this plan by shooting Johnston
    in the back. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant admitted that he killed Johnston. His
    primary defence was that he shot Johnston in self-defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The jury convicted the appellant of second degree
    murder and of using a firearm while committing an indictable offence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant appeals those two convictions and the length
    of his sentence. He argues that the trial judge made a number of mistakes,
    primarily in his instructions to the jury on the issue of self-defence. He also
    says that the sentence is excessive. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons that follow, I
    would allow the appeal from the convictions under appeal, set them aside and
    order a new trial. In the circumstances, I do not reach the sentence appeal. </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><b>THE BACKGROUND FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It is useful to review various
    aspects of the evidence to give context to the issue on which this appeal turns
    – the adequacy of the jury instructions concerning self-defence. Much of this
    evidence came through the testimony of the appellant.</span></p>

    The appellant said “yes”, and Johnston replied, “Well, I’m always good.” The

    problems with Johnston. The appellant felt that leaving the garage, either
    through the front door or by entering Unit 19 and locking the door, and then calling
    the police might solve the immediate issue but would make things worse in the
    long-run since Johnston and his associates would likely retaliate against him
    and his sister. The appellant felt that waiting in the garage was not a

    he left.</span></p>

    closed his eyes and pulled the trigger. He closed his eyes again, took a couple

    his garage window and saw a person running in front of Unit 10 with a gun in

    shot. Bullet holes and ejected casings were found in the vicinity and in the

    at trial was that the appellant was guilty of first degree murder. Following
    the garage incident, the appellant decided to put an end to his dispute with
    Johnston by following Johnston into the street and putting an end to Johnston
    himself. With this specific intent in mind, the appellant cocked his loaded gun,
    put it in his waistband and went out to the street. There, he confronted
    Johnston, pulled out his gun and, as Johnston turned and fled, the appellant
    shot Johnston in the back.</span></p>

    threatened to kill the appellant. The appellant was unsuccessful in his
    attempts to diffuse the situation between him and Johnston and so Decastro took
    Johnston out of the garage and onto the street. The appellant conceded that
    while he was in the garage he had a number of available options to escape
    Johnston’s aggression. However, he rejected them as he had reason to continue
    to try to de-escalate the dispute with Johnston – mainly to protect his sister.
    To this end he went out to the street. </span></p>

    consider the entirety of the sequence of events:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='

    the end of the sequence of events, much as you don’t consider the three
    elements just at the start of the sequence of events. You have to consider the
    three elements throughout the sequence of events. And why is that important?
    It’s important, I respectfully submit to you, because you always have to bear
    in mind that self-defence is a defence of last resort. <u>So that if you, the
    jury, determine when considering the entire sequence of events, that reasonably
    an alternative other than shooting [Johnston] existed for [the appellant], then

    garage:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='
line-height:normal'>I suggested other
    alternatives that I said were available to him <u>while he remained in the
    garage</u>. I suggested he could have used his cell phone to call the police. I

    close the garage door. I suggested that he could have gone into Unit 19 and
    called the police. He could have gone into Unit 19 and out the back door. And I
    suggested that he could have gone out of the garage, the big garage door,
    turned right, and left the complex…. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='

    have another alternative at that point in the sequence. Could he have, acting
    reasonably, turned and left? Could he have acted reasonably, gone over to Unit

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='

    Unit 12, would it be reasonable to turn around, go into Unit 14 and lock the

    defence counsel argued that in the portions of the Crown’s argument noted

    the intent to murder Johnston. That the appellant failed to avail himself of

    Johnston’s actions when Johnston confronted him on the street. In answering
    this question, the jury was entitled to consider the surrounding events,
    including what happened in the garage, as it informed the appellant’s state of
    mind and actions during the street incident. It informed the alternatives
    reasonably available to the appellant at the moment he was on the street facing
    Johnston as Johnston (according to the appellant) moved toward him, threatened
    him and brought his hand to his waistband. </span></p>

    sequence of events, that reasonably an alternative other than shooting
    [Johnston] existed for [the appellant], then [the appellant] [couldn’t] rely on
    self-defence.” And, as set out above, Crown counsel suggested a number of
    alternatives available to the appellant prior to Johnston’s moving toward him,
    including retreat options open to the appellant while he was in the garage. I
    agree with the objection taken by defence counsel that these submissions could
    have left the jury with the impression that the appellant was precluded from
    raising the defence of self-defence because, immediately after the garage
    incident, he had not taken advantage of opportunities to save himself from
    harm. </span></p>

    otherwise save himself from death or grievous bodily harm. Although the meaning

    relevance of the garage incident – significantly of the appellant’s decision to
    follow Johnston to the street rather than leave the party or call the police –
    to the issue of whether the appellant reasonably believed that he could not

    a question from the jury become all the more damaging given that questions tend
    to relate to important parts in the jury’s reasoning: <i>Pétel</i>, at p. 15.
    Indeed, in <i>W. (D.)</i>, the Supreme Court noted that, had the reversal of
    the burden of proof occurred in the course of a response to a question from the

style='line-height:200%'> instruction in her charge to the jury. A <i>Baxter </i>instruction
    was necessary because it was critical for the jury to understand that the
    appellant was not required to engage in detached reflection, as the Crown
    suggested he should have done in the garage, when he was faced with a
    reasonably apprehended attack involving a gun. </span></p>

    whether the charge conveyed the requirement of an honest and reasonable belief
    by the accused that his use of force was necessary. The Crown argues that the
    trial judge, in her instructions, captured the essence of the <i>Baxter </i>instruction
    by telling the jury that the appellant was not required to exactly measure his
    necessary defensive action. The Crown relies on the case of <i>R. v. Krasniqi</i>,
    2012 ONCA 561, 291 C.C.C. (3d) 236, in which this court dismissed an appeal
    involving a jury charge with exactly the same wording as the trial judge’s
    charge. The Crown contends that the jury would have understood from the charge
    as a whole that the appellant only needed to honestly believe that his actions
    were necessary in the circumstances. Alternatively, says the Crown, no
    substantial wrong occurred and the absence of a <i>Baxter </i>instruction was
    mitigated by the rest of the charge. </span></p>

    at para. 95. As this court explained in <em>Krasniqi</em>, at para. 96, it is
    the message in the <em>Baxter</em> instruction which must be brought home to
    the jury rather than a specific incantation. <span style='line-height:200%'>Jurisprudence
    has made it clear that, standing on its own, a failure to give a <i>Baxter</i> instruction is not fatal to a charge on self-defence: see e.g. </span><em>Krasniqi</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    following Crown counsel’s argument that if the jury found that after the garage
    incident the appellant did not avail himself of reasonable opportunities to
    retreat, self-defence was not available to him. The trial judge also failed to
    assist the jury in its obvious confusion about the relevance of the garage
    incident to the defence of self-defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>2. On a number of occasions, including in answer to a

    judge’s role is to limit the evidence to areas properly admitted – objection or
    no objection. The evidence of experts must be confined to the witness’s field

    intent and failed to provide a “rolled-up” charge. In relation to this ground

    provocation, the appellant argues that Johnston provoked the appellant when he
    threatened to kill him and his sister. The sudden reaction was the appellant’s
    pulling the gun and shooting before having an opportunity to cool down. The
    appellant submits that there was an air of reality to provocation and the trial
    judge erred by not leaving it with the jury. Self-defence and provocation are
    not necessarily incompatible. The fact that the appellant denied acting out of
    anger and testified that he was concerned about his safety and therefore went
    for his weapon does not deprive provocation of an air of reality.</span></p>
