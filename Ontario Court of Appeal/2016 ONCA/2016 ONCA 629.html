  <p class=Heading>Huscroft J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ben and Sheila Wise (the “Wises”) owned
    lakefront property. They wanted to sever the land into two lots and gift one of
    the lots to their daughter and son-in-law, Jordanna and Earl Lipson (the
    “Lipsons”). The severance was eventually completed following the death of Ben
    Wise in 2002. The lot gifted to the Lipsons connected with a local road, but the
    lot the Wises retained for themselves did not have road access. The Wises did
    not reserve an easement over the Lipsons’ lot when the gift was completed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent bank, which holds a mortgage over
    the parcel of the land retained by the Wises (and now owned by Sheila Wise), brought
    an application for an order declaring that an easement exists for the benefit
    of the Wise property. Although there is access to the Wise property from the
    lake, the application judge found that water access was “impractical” and, as a
    result, recognized the bank’s claim for an easement of necessity over the
    Lipson property. He directed a trial to determine the location of the easement
    in the event the parties were unable to agree. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the application judge erred in concluding
    that there was an easement of necessity. I would allow the appeal, for the
    reasons that follow.</span></p>
  <p style='line-height:150%'><b><span style='line-height:150%'>Background</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The properties in question are lakefront
    properties on Lake Manitouwabing. The Wises owned a large parcel of land (the
    “combined parcel”). The combined parcel was adjacent to the Inn and Tennis
    Resort lands, which were owned by Ben Wise’s company, MB Investments Limited,
    until 2011. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The combined parcel was severed in 2003. This
    resulted in two lots, Part 1 and Part 2. Sheila Wise retained Part 2, where she
    has a cottage. Part 1 was gifted to the Lipsons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The gift was the culmination of a long process
    begun by Ben Wise some years earlier. Permission to sever the combined parcel
    was denied by planning officials because Part 2 would have become a
    water-access only lot. Although there were water-access only lots on the lake,
    no additional such lots were being approved. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The combined parcel had access to a road, but the
    road connected to the proposed Part 1 rather than Part 2. However, Part 2 was
    accessible through the Inn and Tennis Resort lands. Ben Wise considered adding
    Part 2 to the Inn and Tennis Resort lands in order to take advantage of the
    road access they had. He chose not to pursue that plan because of adverse tax
    consequences. Instead, he decided to enter a restriction under s. 118 of the <em>Land
    Titles Act, </em>R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;L.5, on Part 2, which would have prevented
    it from being sold separately from the Inn and Tennis Resort lands.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That restriction was never registered. Following
    the death of Ben Wise, Part 1 was conveyed to the Lipsons and no easement was
    reserved in favour of Part 2. Part 2 had no legal entitlement to road access across
    the Inn and Tennis Resort lands and so became a water-access only lot, despite
    the absence of prior approval. However, Sheila Wise continued to obtain access
    to her home through the Inn and Tennis Resort lands. These lands were purchased
    by 2276552 Ontario Inc. (“227”) in 2011 through power of sale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sheila Wise is in default on two mortgages on
    Part 2. The respondent bank holds a first mortgage on the property and 1432975
    Ontario Limited holds a second mortgage. Both mortgagors wish to sell the
    property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent bank brought an application for an
    order declaring that an easement of necessity exists over any of the adjacent properties
    in favour of Part&nbsp;2.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The application judge’s decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge determined that an
    easement of necessity is available to both grantors and grantees of land if either
    the land retained or the land granted is rendered inaccessible by severance and
    sale. He stated: “The ultimate objective is that land should be able to be
    used.” The application judge considered that it was unnecessary to direct a
    trial on the question of the Wises’ intentions at the time of the severance and
    gift of Part 1, because easements are “creatures of public policy” and
    “[p]ublic policy must trump the intentions of individual landowners.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge considered that mere
    inconvenience was insufficient to allow the grant of an easement of necessity,
    but found that the common law requirement of absolute or strict necessity had
    developed into a rule of “practical necessity”, citing <em>Hirtle</em> <em>v.
    Ernst</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (1991)</span></em><em>, </em>10
    N.S.R. (2d) 216, [1991] N.S.J. No. 531 (S.C.).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge concluded that water
    access to Part 2 did not preclude an easement of necessity. The test, he said,
    citing <em>Dobson v. Tulloch</em> (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 533, [1994] O.J. No. 531
    (C.J. (Gen. Div.)), aff’d (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 800 (C.A.), is “whether water
    access is sufficient to make unnecessary an easement of necessity that is
    otherwise necessary for the reasonable enjoyment of the property” (para. 55).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge found no evidence that
    Part 2 had ever been accessed by water and accepted the uncontradicted evidence
    of the respondent’s surveyor, Paul Forth, that water access to Part 2 was
    “impractical”. He found, specifically, that water access “does not offer a
    viable, or practical, means of access to and egress from Part 2” (para. 62). He
    concluded that an easement of necessity over Part 1 arose in April 2003, when
    Part 2 became landlocked and the owners had no legal entitlement to cross any
    adjoining lands to get to their property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge ordered a trial to
    determine the most efficacious and least intrusive location of the easement in
    the event the parties were unable to agree.</span></p>

    judge erred in three ways: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by considering

style='line-height:200%'>by determining that easements of necessity are based

lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I begin with a brief review of the principles
    governing easements of necessity, before applying the relevant principles to
    the facts of this case. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The principles governing easements of necessity</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The basic requirements of an easement of
    necessity were described by this court in <em>McClatchie v. Rideau Lake
    (Township)</em>, 2015 ONCA 233, [2015] O.J. No. 1737. As Rouleau J.A.
    explained, easements of necessity are “presumed to have been granted when the
    land that is sold is inaccessible except by passing over adjoining land
    retained by the grantor. The concept arises from the premise that the easement
    is an implied grant allowing the purchaser to access the purchased lot” (para.
    48).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is well established that the necessity of an
    easement of necessity is determined at the time of the grant (para. 49).
    Moreover, an easement of necessity “must be necessary to use or access the
    property; if access without it is merely inconvenient, the easement will not be
    implied” (para. 53).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As the application judge noted, <em>McClatchie</em> addresses the implication of easements of necessity only from the perspective
    of a grantee of land – the person who obtains the land in favour of which an
    easement is required. It is well established, however, that an easement of
    necessity is also available to a grantor of land – the original owner who
    retains part of the land: see <em>Gale on Easements, </em>19th ed. (London:
    Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2012), at p. 178; <em>Depew v. Wilkes</em></span><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;(2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 499 (C.A.), at para. 21</span><span
lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although English authority holds that the test
    for an easement of necessity is more difficult to meet when the easement is
    sought by the grantor rather than the grantee (see <em>Gale on Easements</em>,
    p. 179), <span style='background:white'>it is not necessary to consider the
    matter for the purposes of this case. This case involves a grantor and there is
    no doubt that the test involving grantors is strict necessity. </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='background:white'>The strong test of strict
    necessity ensures that </span><span lang=EN-US>grantors are not permitted to
    derogate from the terms of their grant of land. If they want to reserve an
    easement, they should do so explicitly at the time they make the grant. <span
style='background:white'>An easement of necessity will be found only if it was
    necessary in order for the grantor to be able to use his or her property at the
    time of the grant. </span>Water access to property defeats a claim of
    necessity, regardless of convenience.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court’s decision in <em>Barbour v. Bailey, </em>2016
    ONCA 98, [2016] O.J. No.&nbsp;3261, illustrates these points, albeit in the
    context of a claim by a grantee rather than a grantor. The court held that an easement
    of necessity was not available because the property for which the easement was
    sought – an island sometimes joined to the beach isthmus during periods of low
    water levels – was not <span style='background:white'>inaccessible and hence
    unusable. Access to the island was certainly not convenient: previous owners of
    the island had used a rowboat, either by rowing it to the island or pulling as
    they waded across the water, or they had walked along the shoreline. Nevertheless,
    water access was possible, and that was enough to defeat an easement of
    necessity. The applicant’s preference for a quicker and more convenient means

    is no dispute that there was water access to Part 2 at the time of the grant,

    irrelevant. So too is the fact that water access was, and probably remains,
    inconvenient or impractical. Water access was available, so Part 2 was not rendered
    unusable when the grant to the Lipsons was made.</span></p>

    conclusion that the necessity test had moved from strict necessity to
    “practical necessity”. This is not correct. The necessity test has not been
    reduced to a requirement of “practical necessity”, as the Nova Scotia Supreme
    Court held in <em>Hirtle</em>. The recent decisions of this court in <em>McClatchie </em>and <em>Barbour </em>reaffirm that the test for easements of necessity in

    for the proposition that easements of necessity are creatures of public policy.
    Although there is no doubt that easements of necessity have the salutary effect
    of allowing land to be used, rather than rendered useless, easements of
    necessity flow from the intentions of the parties to a grant, not from public
    policy. Put another way, public policy does not provide an independent basis
    for a court to recognize an easement of necessity regardless of the parties’
    intentions in particular circumstances.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is reflected in <em>McClatchie</em>, which
    describes easements of necessity as arising as a matter of presumption and as
    an implied aspect of the grant. As the English Court of Appeal explained in <em>Nickerson
    v. Barraclough</em>,  [1981] Ch. 426 (C.A.), at p. 447<span style='color:#191919'>:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he law relating to ways of necessity rests not upon a basis
    of public policy but upon the implication to be drawn from the fact that unless
    some way is implied, a parcel of land will be inaccessible. From that fact the
    implication arises that the parties must have intended that some way giving
    access to the land should have been granted. … Public policy may inhibit the
    parties from carrying their intention into effect, but I cannot see how public
    policy can have a bearing upon what their intention was. In my judgment, that
    must be ascertained in accordance with the ordinary principles of construction,
    the language used and relevant admissible evidence of surrounding
    circumstances.</p>

    of water access means that the test of necessity at the time of the grant is
    not met. Finally, the application judge also erred in law in holding that
