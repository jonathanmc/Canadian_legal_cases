  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Helen A. Rady of the
    Superior Court of Justice, dated July 20, 2015.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Hourigan J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>Overview</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal is about the interpretation of s.
    131(1) of the <em>Securities Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5. That subsection
    provides that, in the context of a misrepresentation in a take-over bid
    circular, the security holders of the offeree issuer may sue on account of that
    misrepresentation. Two issues arise. The first is whether the security holder
    must choose between suing the offeror and suing the offerors directors and
    other individuals who signed or approved the take-over bid circular.  The second
    is whether security holders who sold their shares in the secondary market can
    rely on s. 131(1) to assert a claim based on a misrepresentation in a take-over
    bid circular. Both issues are questions of first impression before this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the first issue, the motion
    judge found that a plaintiff who wants to bring an action under s. 131(1) must
    make an election as to whom it will sue. As I will explain below, in my view,
    the motion judge focused too narrowly on the plain meaning of s. 131(1). The
    modern principle of statutory interpretation requires the court to look not only
    to the plain meaning of a particular provision but to the surrounding context
    in which the words of that provision are found. Here, once you pan the
    analytical lens out to view s. 131(1) as part of a larger scheme of civil
    liability for misrepresentation in securities markets, the motion judges
    interpretation cannot be sustained.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the second issue, the motion
    judge found that security holders who transacted in the secondary market cannot
    rely on s. 131(1) to assert a claim. In my view, the motion judge was correct
    in her analysis on this point. The argument that secondary market participants
    have a cause of action under s. 131(1) ignores the legislative scheme and
    history of the <em>Securities Act</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In these reasons, I consider first the
    background facts to put the legal analysis in context. In the analysis section,
    I first review the modern principle of statutory interpretation. I then
    consider the two issues identified above in light of that principle. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants were security holders of the
    respondent, Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation (Baffinland).  On September 22,
    2010, Baffinland was the target of a hostile take-over bid by a group headed by
    the respondent, Jowdat Waheed. Mr. Waheed had previously been hired by
    Baffinland to provide strategic advice to its board.  The respondent,
    ArcelorMittal S.A., first made a friendly bid for Baffinland on its own behalf
    and then ultimately submitted a joint take-over bid with Mr. Waheeds group.
    That joint take-over bid expired in February 2011.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As required by the <em>Securities Act</em>, the
    joint take-over bid included a take-over bid circular, which was sent to all of
    Baffinlands security holders and filed with the Ontario Securities Commission
    (the OSC). Pursuant to their obligations under the Act, the directors and
    officers of Baffinland considered the bid and prepared a directors circular.
    This document was also provided to all of Baffinlands security holders and was
    filed with the OSC.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants commenced a class action alleging
    that the circulars failed to disclose material information and that the
    information that was disclosed in the circulars was materially misleading and
    replete with misrepresentations about the business and affairs of Baffinland.
    They sued the persons and companies who signed and filed the circulars,
    alleging that, as a consequence of the defendants conduct, they received less
    for their Baffinland securities than they otherwise would have.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants rely on s. 131(1) of the <em>Securities</em><i> Act</i>, which provides as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><span lang=EN-US>131. (1)</span></b><span
class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>Where a take-over bid circular sent to
    the security holders of an offeree issuer as required by the regulations
    related to Part XX, or any notice of change or variation in respect of the
    circular, contains a misrepresentation, <span class=Underline>a security holder
    may</span>, without regard to whether the security holder relied on the
    misrepresentation, <span class=Underline>elect to exercise a right of action
    for rescission or damages against the offeror or a right of action for damages
    against</span>,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(a) every person who at the time the circular or notice, as
    the case may be, was signed was a director of the offeror;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b) every person or company whose consent in respect of the
    circular or notice, as the case may be, has been filed pursuant to a
    requirement of the regulations but only with respect to reports, opinions or
    statements that have been made by the person or company; and</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(c) each person who signed a certificate in the circular or
    notice, as the case may be, other than the persons included in clause
    (a).&nbsp;[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents brought various motions to
    strike the appellants statement of claim. Those motions were largely
    unsuccessful. However, there are two rulings on the motions to strike that the
    appellants appeal to this court. First, the ruling that the appellants are
    required under s. 131(1) to elect whether to sue the offerors under the joint
    bid or their respective directors and signatories. Second, the ruling that security
    holders who transacted in the secondary market may not assert a claim pursuant
    to s. 131(1) of the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong>(1)      Modern Principle of Statutory Interpretation</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The starting point in a review of the modern
    principle of statutory interpretation is<i> <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd</em>.
    (Re),</i> [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27. That case provides both general guidance on the
    proper approach to statutory interpretation and specific guidance on how to
    apply that approach where the plain meaning of a provision appears to conflict
    with its underlying statutory purpose. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-US>Rizzo Shoes</span></em><span lang=EN-US> is
    the best known authority for how to approach the task of statutory
    interpretation and has been cited more than 3,000 times by courts at all levels.
    Iacobucci J., writing for the court, endorsed Driedgers modern principle of
    statutory interpretation, at para. 21, quoting the following passage from Elmer
    Driedger, <em>Construction of Statutes</em>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths,
    1983), at p.&nbsp;87:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the
    words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the
    Act, and the intention of Parliament. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>With these words, the Supreme Court
    fully embraced Elmer Driedgers modern principle of statutory interpretation.
    But to fully appreciate the significance of this statement, we have to ask:
    modern compared to what? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ruth Sullivan explains that, in the nineteenth
    and for much of the twentieth centuries, statutory interpretation was dominated
    by the plain meaning rule. That rule held that where the words of a statute
    were clear and unambiguous, the courts applied them as they were written  even
    if legislative intention or practical considerations pointed in another
    direction. At times, courts relied instead on the so-called golden rule, which
    allowed courts to depart from the plain meaning of a statute but only when that
    meaning lead to absurd results.: Ruth Sullivan, <em>Sullivan on the
    Construction of Statutes</em>, 6th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2014),
    at §2.13-2.17. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The modern principle takes a more holistic view.
    As Iacobucci J. explained in <em>Rizzo Shoes</em>, at para. 21, the modern
    principle recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the
    wording of the legislation alone. Sullivan expands on this idea, at §2.18:
    Today, as the modern principle indicates, legislative intent, textual meaning
    and legal norms are all legitimate concerns of interpreters and each has a role
    to play in <span class=Underline>every</span> interpretive effort (emphasis
    added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That is the general guidance that <em>Rizzo
    Shoes</em> provides in all cases involving statutory interpretation. Equally
    important for present purposes is the guidance the case provides in
    circumstances where the plain meaning of a provision appears to conflict with
    its underlying statutory purpose. The issue in <em>Rizzo Shoes</em> was whether
    employees who lost their jobs when their employer went bankrupt were entitled
    to termination and severance pay under the <em>Employment Standards Act</em><i>, <em>1981</em></i>, S.O. 1981, c. 22 (the <em>ESA</em>). That statute provided

    lamenting the popularity of what he regards as the unnecessary legal phrase
    and/or, Garner explains, at pp. 45-46: If you are offered a coffee or tea,
    you may pick either (or in this case, neither), or you may for whatever reason
    order both. This is the ordinary sense of the word, understood by everyone and

    to exercise a right of action for rescission or damages against the offeror)
    should be read exclusively, since rescission and damages are treated as
    alternative causes of action in Part XXIII of the Act. The second or (or a right
    of action for damages against) should be read inclusively  a plaintiff electing
    to sue for damages can sue the offeror, the offerors directors and

  <p class=Heading>(b)      Positions of the Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants note that s. 131(1) refers to
    security holders and is not qualified by any other condition. They argue that,
    had the legislature intended to restrict the s. 131 right of action, it would
    have been a straightforward task to add appropriate limiting language. In their
    view, there is no basis for treating class members who tendered in the
    take-over bid and those whose shares were compulsorily acquired differently
    from those who sold in the secondary market. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants further submit that the Act
    requires that accurate and complete information related to a take-over bid be provided
    to security holders. This disclosure requirement is consistent with the
    issuers on-going disclosure obligations and is not directed solely to security
    holders who are determining whether to tender to a bid. It is the appellants
    position that all sellers who are the victims of misrepresentations in
    circulars should have the right to sue because any distortion of the sale price
    caused by the misrepresentations affects all sellers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents submit that the order striking
    out the s. 131 secondary market claims is consistent with the liability scheme
    under the <em>Securities Act</em>, the content of the forms required by s. 131,
    and the availability of rescission as a remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents position is that Part XXIII.1
    is designed to provide a remedy to security holders who trade in the secondary
    market, whereas s. 131 is restricted to target security holders who tender and
    sell their shares pursuant to a take-over bid. In their submission, the
    appellants attempted reliance on s. 131 in the context of trades in the
    secondary market is nothing more than an attempt to bypass the leave
    requirements, liability caps, and other elements of Part XXIII.1 included by
    the legislature as part of the balance struck in creating statutory secondary
    market liability for misrepresentations. </span></p>
  <h5>(c)      Application of the Modern Principle</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Again, a proper interpretive approach to the
    issue requires the court to consider the words of s. 131(1) in their entire
    context, with regard to their ordinary and grammatical meaning, and in harmony
    with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of the legislature.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The term security holder must be read in the
    context of the surrounding words in the subsection. As the motion judge noted,
    it is significant that rescission is an available remedy under the subsection.
    Obviously, rescission is not available to a security holder who sold in the
    secondary market and is only available to a security holder who transacted
    directly with the offeror by tendering to the take-over bid. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that the availability of a
    rescission option under s.&nbsp;131(1) is not determinative. They point out
    that, while rescission is not an available remedy for secondary market
    participants, that does not by necessary implication preclude the other
    available remedy of damages.  The appellants also observe that there is no
    right of rescission in s. 131(2), which provides for a right of action with
    respect to misrepresentation in a directors circular.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would reject these arguments.  I agree with
    Perell J.s reasoning in <em>Tucci v. Smart Technologies Inc</em><i>.</i>, 2013
    ONSC 802, 114 O.R. (3d) 294, at para. 42, that it would be an anomalous result if
    s. 131(1) provided different remedies depending on whether a security holder
    tendered into the bid or sold into the secondary market. The availability of
    rescission as a remedy is an indication that the legislature designed the
    subsection for the benefit of security holders who could use all of the
    available remedies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Furthermore, the absence of the remedy of
    rescission in s. 131(2) simply reflects the fact that, unlike offerors,
    directors of a take-over bid target have no ability to return shares tendered
    to and taken up pursuant to a bid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Also significant for this part of the analysis is
    the content of the forms required by s. 131. The prescribed forms for the
    take-over bid circular (Form 62-504F1), the issuer bid circular (Form 62-504F2),
    and the directors circular (Form 62-504F3) each impose a catch-all obligation
    to disclose matters that would reasonably be expected to affect the decision
    of the security holders of the offeree issuer to accept or reject the offer.
    This language is consistent with the notion that the focus of s. 131 is a
    security holders decision whether to tender to a bid, not a security holders
    decision whether to trade on the secondary market.  Further support can be
    found in <em>Allen</em>, at para. 5, where Strathy J. states that take-over bid
    rules are designed to provide security holders of the target company with
    sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether to tender to
    a bid. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning now to the ordinary and grammatical
    meaning of the term security holder, I agree with the appellants submission
    that there are no restrictions or qualifiers on the term. I also agree that it
    would have been an easy task for the legislature to add appropriate limiting
    language.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The critical part of the analysis regarding the scheme
    of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of the legislature is the
    interplay between s. 131(1) and Part XXIII.1 of the Act, which provides a
    statutory cause of action for secondary market participants. The parties do not
    agree on whether that cause of action is available in the context of a
    take-over bid.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that they do not have a
    right of action under that part of the Act. They note that, under s. 138.2(c),
    the Part XXIII.1 civil liability regime does not apply to, among other things,
    the acquisition or disposition of an issuers security in connection with or
    pursuant to a take-over bid, except as prescribed by regulation. According to
    the appellants, in connection with would include sellers who sold Baffinland
    securities in the secondary market in the context of a take-over bid.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, the appellants argue that, even if
    the sellers in the secondary market could avail themselves of the Part XXIII.1
    right of action, s. 138.13 explicitly provides that the remedy does not
    derogate from any other rights of action a claimant may have. Their position is
    that there is no reason why a plaintiff who sold in the secondary market could
    not have rights of action under s.&nbsp;131 and Part XXIII.1 in different
    circumstances. In the case of Part XXIII.1, limited by the words in connection
    with in s. 138.2(c), the appellants suggest that a plaintiff might sue under
    Part XXIII.1 after a take-over bid has come to an end.  The appellants suggest
    no such limitations on the application of s. 131.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents submit that the definition of a core
    document in Part XXIII.1 specifically includes a take-over bid circular, an
    issuer bid circular, a directors circular, a notice of change or variation in
    respect of a take-over bid circular, issuer bid circular or directors
    circular. Thus, they argue that the right of action would be available to
    secondary market traders in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the respondents make a compelling
    argument on the availability of Part XXIII.1 in the context of a take-over bid
    and their position should be preferred.  Why would the legislature include circulars
    within the definition of core documents if the intention was not to grant a right
    to sue with respect to those documents? And why would the legislature include
    such a statutory right of action if it already existed under s. 131(1)?  The
    legislature must be presumed to have a created a coherent and consistent
    legislative scheme. It is highly unlikely that the legislature would enact a
    redundant right of action. </span></p>

    suggestion that those who sell their securities on the secondary market are
    able to avail themselves of both remedies. The availability of s. 131 to these
    sellers would render Part XXIII.1 nugatory. If s. 131 provides an unfettered
    right to sue, why would a plaintiff ever chose to sue under Part XXIII.1 and thus
    to be subject to the leave requirement and liability caps imposed by that Part? </span></p>

    [2015] 2 S.C.R. 106. She explained, at para. 27, that legislation aimed at
    secondary market liability grew out of Canada-wide efforts to develop a more
    meaningful and accessible form of recourse for investors. She continued as
    follows, at paras. 27, 29-30:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Historically, Canadian investors in the secondary trading
    market did not have access to a statutory cause of action when they suffered
    losses as a result of breaches of legislated continuous disclosure obligations.
    In common law jurisdictions, investors had to rely on the tort of negligent
    misrepresentation, which required, among other things, that investors prove
    that they had relied on the misinformation or omission of information to their
    detriment. Because it was extremely difficult to prove such reliance when securities
    were purchased in the secondary market, this requirement put meaningful redress
    out of reach for many who were harmed by dubious disclosure practices. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>During the 1990s, following a series of high profile
    misrepresentations and incidents of questionable disclosure practices among
    publicly traded companies in Canada, the Toronto Stock Exchange created the
    Allen Committee to re-examine the regime governing disclosure in the secondary
    market. The Allen Committee concluded that the current sanctions and funding
    available to regulators... are inadequate and the remedies available to
    investors in secondary trading markets who are injured by misleading disclosure
    are so difficult to pursue that they are, as a practical matter, largely
    hypothetical. It recommended the creation of a statutory civil liability
    regime that would help investors sue issuers, directors, and officers who
    violated their statutory disclosure obligations. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Canadian Securities Administrators, an umbrella
    organization of Canada's provincial and territorial securities regulators,
    adopted most of the Committee's recommendations and began developing proposals
    to implement them across Canada. Despite the fact that the Allen Committee had
    not recommended it, and in order to discourage the kind of strike suits that
    had become common in the United States under more investor-friendly regimes,
    the Canadian Securities Administrators recommended that in addition to reducing
    the burden of proof on investors, the new liability regime should include a
    screening mechanism to ensure that only claims with a reasonable chance of
    success would be brought. [Citations omitted.]</p>

    refused, [2012] S.C.C.A. No. 246.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Clearly there was a gap in the legislative
    scheme with respect to secondary market participants. The legislature filled
    that gap. They did so on the basis that there was no statutory right of action
    for secondary market participants. In providing that right of action, the
    legislature headed the advice of Cardozo J. in <em>Ultramares Corporation v.
    Touche</em><span style='background:white'>, 174 N.E. 441 (N.Y. App. Ct. 1931)</span> <span style='background:white'>that the law should not admit &quot;to a
    liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an
    indeterminate class.&quot; It was for this reason that the legislature included
    a leave requirement and capped liability.  I agree with the submission of the
    respondents that the appellants attempted reliance on s.&nbsp;131(1) for
    secondary market participants is an impermissible attempt to avoid the
    restrictions placed on the operation of the statutory cause of action found in
    Part XXIII.1. </span></span></p>

lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, applying the modern principle of
    statutory interpretation to this issue, the appellants cannot succeed. While
    the plain meaning of the term security holder might support the broad
    interpretation they urge upon us, that interpretation is not supported by the
    context in which it appears and is inconsistent with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of the legislature.</span></p>

Given the divided success on the appeal, I would make no order as to costs. </span></p>
