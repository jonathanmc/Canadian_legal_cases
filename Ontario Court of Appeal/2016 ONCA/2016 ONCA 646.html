    Wilton-Siegel of the Superior Court of Justice, dated April 15, 2015, with
    reasons reported at 2014 ONSC 7435, 54 R.P.R. (5th) 48. </p>
  <p class=Judge>Pepall J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal involves the meaning of the term “fair market value of the
    demised lands” in the rent-reset clause of two long-term leases and the
    application of issue estoppel. The provisions governing the resetting of rent have
    been in place since 1961. Since the inception of the leasing relationship, the
    interpretative exercise has resulted in two arbitrations, two appeals from the
    arbitral awards and now this appeal. The focus of the parties’ dispute is
    whether the value of the “demised lands” should take into account a potential
    use – a freehold residential condominium project – that is impossible because the
    lands are subject to a lease.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and the respondents are all parties to two 100-year
    leases (the “Leases”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=MsoPageNumber>At the time of the first reset in 1990, the
    parties could not agree on the rent. Their dispute proceeded to arbitration and
    was ultimately resolved on an appeal to the Divisional Court. That decision
    held that the demised lands should be valued as if vacant but subject to a
    lease. Therefore, the fair market value (“FMV”) of the lands was determined
    without including a hypothetical freehold residential condominium project in
    the valuation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The 2010 reset also resulted in arbitration.<span
class=MsoPageNumber> A majority of the arbitral panel (the “Majority”) valued
    the lands based on development of a mixed-use commercial-retail and freehold
    condominium project. As a result of the Majority’s interpretation, the rent of at
    least one of the respondents was reset at approximately four times the prior amount.
    On appeal, Wilton-Siegel J. (the “Appeal Judge”) held that the Majority had
    erred in law in valuing the lands on the basis of its use for freehold
    condominium development. He set aside the award and remitted the dispute back
    to the same arbitral panel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>All of the parties appeal from
    that decision. The appellant asks that the Majority Award be restored. The
    respondents ask that the reasons of the dissenting arbitrator be adopted or
    that the dispute be remitted to a new arbitral panel. </span></p>

    would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeals. </span></p>
  <h1><span class=MsoPageNumber>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Background</span></h1>

    Victoria University (the “College” or the “Landlord”), is the owner of land
    located on Bloor Street West in Toronto, Ontario. By an agreement dated
    February 20, 1960, the College entered into a ground lease with 141 Bloor West
    Limited for that land. In 1961, that one lease was replaced by the two Leases:
    one for 131 Bloor St. West (“131”) and one for 151 Bloor St. West (“151”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Company Limited (“Revenue Properties”) is the successor in interest to the
    lessee of 131. The respondents GE Canada Real Estate Equity and GE Canada Real
    Estate Equity Holding Company (“GE” and, collectively with Revenue Properties,
    the “Tenants”) are the successors in interest to the lessee of 151. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    fixed for the first 30 years. Then, if the parties could not agree, the new
    rent for the next 20 years would be the greater of (i) the current rent; or
    (ii) six percent of the FMV of the demised lands as determined by arbitration. The
    Leases then provide for rental resets every 20 years following, with a final reset
    for the last 10-year period. Specifically, the Leases stated:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>WITNESSETH that in consideration of the rents, covenant and
    agreements hereinafter reserved and contained on the part of the Lessee to be
    paid, observed and performed, the Lessor has demised and leased, and by these

    land more particularly described in Part I of the Schedule hereto and forming
    part hereof, together with and subject to the rights-of-way described in Part

    the rights-of-way being hereinafter called the “demised lands”.</span></span> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>                                                            …</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>For each of the three succeeding
    periods of twenty years and the last period of ten years during the term of
    this Lease, in the event that the Lessor and Lessee cannot, prior to six (6)
    months before the end of the previous thirty (30), twenty (20), twenty (20) or
    twenty (20) year periods, as the case may be, agree in writing upon a new
    rental, the amount of the new annual rental shall be the greater of the rental
    for the current thirty (30), twenty (20), twenty (20) or twenty (20) year
    period then ending, or the amount fixed after arbitration, as hereinafter stated.
    The provisions of Clause 1 of Paragraph VI … shall apply to the appointment of
    an arbitrator or arbitrators who shall thereupon, within the six (6) months’
    period aforesaid, appraise and determine the fair market value of the demised
    lands. Six percent (6%) of such evaluation of fair market value, or the same
    annual rental as for the current period, whichever is greater, shall be payable
    in equal monthly installments in advance as the annual rental for the next
    succeeding period. </span></p>

    or factual matrix associated with the Leases. That said, we do know that, when
    the lease was entered into in 1960, the land was vacant. In addition, condominiums,
    which are creatures of statute, were not yet in existence in Ontario. That
    changed with the enactment of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-26,
    in 1967. The Act limited condominiums to freehold property and therefore
    condominiums could not be built by a landlord or tenant on lands subject to a
    lease.</span></p>

    as Britannica House, was erected on GE’s lands. Revenue Properties built a 14-storey
    mixed residential and commercial building, known as the Colonnade, on its
    lands. The residential portion consisted of rental apartments. Neither property

    the first arbitral panel and the Divisional Court are described below. </p>

    Revenue Properties’ position was that FMV was to be determined having regard to
    the Leases and taking into consideration Revenue Properties’ use of the lands,
    the buildings and improvements, the economic reasonableness of the ground rent,
    and limitations imposed on potential uses of the lands under various statutes. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-      The basic question was: what is the proper
    construction of the words “[FMV] of the demised lands”?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-      FMV is based on what a seller and buyer, each
    knowledgeable and willing, would pay on the open market. The parties intended
    to value the property’s worth, not its utility for a given purpose.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>This was a net lease with the Tenants
    assuming all financial obligations relating to both land and buildings and it
    could be inferred from the method of calculation that the parties were thinking
    of an interest rate on a capital investment and fluctuations in value of such
    investment; value meant market value, monetary worth or marketable price.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No specific meaning should be given to the word ‘demised’ and ‘demised
    lands’ simply refers to the lands.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>All applicable statutes and laws

  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-      The lands should be valued as if vacant.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-      However, the lands should be valued as encumbered,
    not unencumbered. A lease is an encumbrance if it diminishes the value of the
    land and a lease on favourable terms to the lessor will be an embellishment. The
    value must take into account the fact that the lands are subject to a lease. To
    ignore this would be to ignore the very basis of the landlord and tenant relationship. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-      The </span><em>Condominium Act </em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>was an encumbrance on the lands. While the value of lands
    would generally increase due to that Act, it did not apply to the Landlord’s lands.
    This was because the Act stated that it was not applicable to lands subject to
    leases. The Landlord should not be entitled to the increased value resulting
    from the Act given that the Act did not apply because of the very lease the Landlord
    had entered into.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-      The detrimental effect of the heritage preservation
    and rent review legislation should be borne by the Tenants as those statutes apply
    to structures and not lands. </span></p>

    to capture periodically the capital value of the property but as affected by

  <p class=CQuote><span
class=MsoPageNumber>-      Laws which regulate the use to which the lands may
    be put, as opposed to those applicable because of the structures placed
    thereon, are properly considered in assessing FMV.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>-      Legislation
    which affects FMV as a result of the very nature of the agreement entered into
    by the parties must be considered absent language to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span

  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>Although condominium statutes vary
    from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, all regimes include the following
    ingredients. The developer of the condominium, having taken the appropriate
    planning and financing steps, constructs a building and then registers with
    appropriate officials a physical description of the project and a declaration
    that he intends the land to be governed henceforth by the relevant condominium
    statute. These documents establish the basic nature of the project (for
    example, a high-rise building with 150 units) and define the divisions of
    interest within it. The registration of these documents establishes a
    corporation without share capital which will serve the interests of the units
    owners from time to time. Each unit owner has a voting right in the governance
    of the corporation proportionate to his interest in the property. All of the
    property in the condominium project is divided among the unit owners, either as
    individual units, to which they have sole and exclusive rights, or as common
    areas, which they all hold as tenants in common … Upon purchasing a unit in a
    condominium, the new owners receive a unit deed conveying to them their units
    in fee simple and (tenant) undivided interests in the common areas.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>[It] is like a traditional condominium except that the
    condominium is on land which is leased by the developer as opposed to being
    owned by the developer. The purchaser of the condominium unit therefore buys an
    interest that is limited as to its duration. The <em>Act</em> states that this
    lease cannot be less than 40 years or more than 99 years, plus rights of
    renewal. At the end of the lease the condominium building reverts to the
    lessor. The common expenses include rent payable to the lessor.</p>

    2(2) of the <i>Condominium Act, 1998 </i>still provides that “[a] declaration

    the leases as meaning that the lands should be valued as lands held in fee

    different opinions. McLachlin C.J.C., in dissent, wrote for herself and three
    others who would have upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision. Gonthier J.,
    writing for himself and three others, concluded that the leases required a
    valuation of a hypothetical fee simple on the reserve. Bastarache J. wrote only
    for himself and held that the phrase “current land value” should be interpreted
    as referring to the value of leasehold reserve land. He concurred in the result

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>  Although they disagreed on the
    result, Gonthier J. and McLachlin C.J.C. agreed on many of the key legal
    principles. They both agreed that, unless specified otherwise, “land” means the
    “right to receive a good title in fee simple” and “value” means the “exchange
    value” of the land, i.e. what a knowledgeable and willing buyer would pay for
    the land on the open market: <i>Musqueam</i>, at paras. 9 and 35-38. They both
    agreed that calculating “fair market value” requires determining the “highest
    and best use” for the land that is legally permissible. Legal restrictions on
    the land should be reflected in the FMV but restrictions imposed by the lease
    itself disregarded:  <i>Musqueam</i>, at paras. 13 and 47. Both of them, at
    paras. 10 and 40, approved of Sexton J.A.’s comment that “the rent represents
    the true return negotiated by the parties on the market value of the land” and “reflects
    the fact that the lessor could sell the land at its current land value and
    reinvest the proceeds at market rates of interest, if not subject to a
    long-term lease”.</span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Ultimately, as noted, Gonthier J.
    parted ways with McLachlin C.J.C. and concluded that the term “current land value”
    meant a hypothetical freehold on the reserve. He explained that the value of
    the land had to reflect the legal restrictions on the land and market
    conditions, which may differ between reserve and off-reserve lands. He endorsed
    the view expressed in </span><em>Revenue Properties #1</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> that legal restrictions on use, such as zoning by-laws,
    should be considered. Discounting the land because of its leasehold features was
    an error in law as current land value means freehold and not leasehold value;
    however, </span>this distinction did not significantly affect the market value
    of the land<span class=MsoPageNumber> here as the trial judge accepted the
    appraisers’ shared view that there was no discernible difference between the
    value of a leasehold and a freehold interest at the start of a long-term lease. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, <em>Musqueam</em> establishes that, absent a contrary
    intention in the lease: (a) the word “land” refers to the freehold or fee
    simple interest in the lands at issue; (b) the word “value” means the exchange
    value of the land, calculated by determining the “highest and best use”
    possible; and (c) fair market value should reflect legal restrictions on the
    land but should ignore any particular restrictions imposed by the lease itself. </p>

    of what interest in land should be valued: freehold or leasehold? Only one

    a lease may affect the fair market value of lands where applicable legislation

    Furthermore, even if they were wrong in their narrow reading of </span><em>Revenue

    holds this view only because he is prepared to consider and read in the terms

    Steele J.’s reasons in </span><em>Revenue Properties</em><span

    agreed on a highest and best use for the lands as being mixed use retail with
    residential condominium towers. The approaches of the parties contrasted in
    part because the College used the perspective of a market participant
    attempting to decide whether to make an offer to purchase whereas the Tenants
    extended this perspective to what could be built. On this issue and most of the
    others, the Majority found in favour of the College. Ultimately the Majority
    decided that the FMV of 131 and 151 was $182,700,000 and $37,325,000,

    lands to be valued, the Appeal Judge noted, at para. 117, that the parties
    accepted that, in accordance with <i>Revenue Properties #1</i>, the value of
    the lands “must take into account the fact the lands are subject to a lease”
    but differed on the meaning of this statement. The Tenants argued that, as a
    result of this statement, the leasehold and not the freehold interest was to be
    valued, whereas the Landlord argued that the fee simple unencumbered by the
    leases was to be valued. Alternatively, the Landlord submitted that </span><em>Musqueam </em><span class=MsoPageNumber>overturned </span><em>Revenue Properties #1</em><span

    Lands to be valued for the purposes of the re-set provision was the freehold
    interest, and that the Majority was consistent with the determination in <i>Revenue

    whether the Majority erred by taking the potential for a freehold condominium

    and economically feasible. </span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Appeal Judge struggled with how to
    interpret the holding in <i>Revenue Properties #</i>1. He identified two
    possible interpretations. At para. 34, he noted that “the decision of Steele J.
    may be analyzed as being grounded solely in the practical consideration that
    the Landlord was not in a position to take advantage of the freehold
    condominium development potential presented by the <i>Condominium Act,</i> prior to expiration of the long-term leases granted to the Tenants.”</span><a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a><span
class=MsoPageNumber> However, he favoured the alternative interpretation,
    namely that the Landlord could not benefit from the </span><em>Condominium Act </em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>to the extent that the Tenants could not also do so: para
    106. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>He then turned to the manner in which
    legislation was to be taken into account in the valuation of the freehold
    interest. The Majority had concluded that any applicable statutes, including
    the </span><em>Condominium Act, 1998</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, that
    affect the use of the lands because of the existence of the leases should be
    considered in the valuation and that the valuation should reflect the potential
    for a freehold condominium project notwithstanding that the Tenants could not
    create a freehold residential condominium project out of their interests.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Appeal Judge held that under both
    the </span><em>Condominium Act</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> and the </span><em>Condominium
    Act, 1998</em>, the Tenants were <span class=MsoPageNumber>precluded from
    establishing a freehold residential condominium project on the lands. While a
    Tenant could establish a leasehold condominium, a freehold condominium
    development cannot be equated to a leasehold condominium development. As such, both
    statutes constituted a restriction on the Tenants’ use of the lands. The Majority
    erred in proceeding on the basis that the statute did not constitute a
    restriction on the Tenants’ use of the land. Alternatively, the Majority erred because
    they failed to follow </span><em>Revenue Properties #1</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> which held that a potential use unavailable to the Tenants
    could not be considered in the valuation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Musqueam</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> did not displace that
    conclusion because it did not address whether land use legislation is to be
    considered regardless of whether a tenant can benefit from such legislation
    whereas </span><em>Revenue Properties #1</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> did. In
    the latter, Adams J. expressly held that any value associated with the
    potential development of lands pursuant to land use legislation that precludes
    development by a tenant ought not to be considered in the assessment of FMV
    absent clear language to the contrary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span

class=MsoPageNumber>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>That said, the Appeal Judge stated, at paras.
    161 to 170, that if it were open to the court to determine this issue <i>de
    novo</i>, he would conclude that the fact that the Tenants cannot create a
    freehold residential condominium on the lands is not a factor to be considered
    in the assessment of FMV. As a matter of contractual interpretation, such an
    approach was consistent with the business purpose of the rent re-set and the notion
    of highest and best use. He concluded at para. 172:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>To summarize the foregoing, while I
    think that the decision of the Majority Award is supportable as a matter of the
    contractual interpretation of the Re-Set Provision, I conclude that the
    decision of the Majority Award is problematic in two respects. First, the
    Majority Award erred as a matter of law to the extent that it based its
    conclusion regarding valuation on a determination that, under the </span><em>Condominium
    Act, 1998</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, the Tenants are able to develop a
    freehold residential condominium on the Lands to the same extent as the
    Landlord. Second, and more significantly, the Majority Award is not consistent
    with the decision in </span><em>Revenue Properties</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> insofar as the majority arbitrators failed to take into
    account the determination in that decision that the freehold interest of the
    Landlord was to be valued excluding any development potential under land use
    legislation of which the Tenants were unable to take advantage, including in
    particular the potential for a freehold residential condominium project on the
    Lands under the </span><em>Condominium Act, 1998</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>.</span></p>

    whether issue estoppel was applicable. The three conditions for issue estoppel
    set out in </span><em>Angle v. M.N.R.,</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> [1975] 2
    S.C.R. 248, were satisfied: the same question has been decided, the decision
    that is said to create the estoppel was final, and the parties are the same. Then,
    referring to this court’s decision in </span><em>Minott v. O’Shanter
    Development Co. </em>(1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321, he acknowledged that the court had
    discretion to not apply issue estoppel<span class=MsoPageNumber> even if the
    constituent elements were satisfied. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    exercise of the court’s discretion to withhold the application of issue
    estoppel based on a change in the law arising from </span><em>Musqueam</em><span

class=MsoPageNumber>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>However, on the second point relating
    to the Tenants’ inability to benefit from the potential for a freehold
    residential condominium project, issue estoppel was applicable. The legal
    effect of the </span><em>Condominium Act, 1998</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> is no different from the legal effect of the </span><em>Condominium Act</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> that was before the Divisional Court in </span><em>Revenue
    Properties #1</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>. The valuation issue is not the
    potential for a leasehold residential condominium project but that of a
    freehold residential condominium project. The Tenants could not create a
    freehold residential condominium project under either statute. There was
    therefore no change in the law and no special circumstances that justified
    withholding the application of issue estoppel.</span></p>

    negative. Special circumstances did not exist. </span><em>Musqueam</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber><i> </i></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>did not change the
    law and no further relevant material had become available. The decision in </span><em>Revenue

    condominium use is not a permitted use of the lands by virtue of the </span><em>Condominium
    Act, 1998</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>. Accordingly, the appraisal of FMV was
    to exclude a freehold residential condominium use by virtue of the restrictions

    power to do so under s. 46(7) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991,
    c. 17. However, he concluded that this power was restricted to applications
    under s. 46. The Tenants had not appealed under any of the grounds contemplated
    by s. 46 of the </span><em>Arbitration Act</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> and,
    instead, had appealed under s. 45. As such, the Appeal Judge concluded that he

    that any such order must be based on the court’s common law authority. However,
    no allegation of a denial of natural justice had been advanced and the Appeal
    Judge saw no basis to remit the dispute to a new arbitral panel. He came to
    this conclusion for four reasons: (i) he rejected the Tenants’ argument that the
    evidence in the expert reports was flawed or inadmissible; (ii) he did not
    accept  that, because the Majority reached a conclusion of FMV on the basis of
    a freehold interest, the quantum of that award would somehow influence the
    final result in the re-hearing; (iii) he had no basis for concluding that any determinations

    and application of the appropriate standard of review is a question of law and

  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Court of Appeal stated that
    “[t]he standard that we must apply in assessing the judgment of Madam Justice
    Koenigsberg is whether in her re-weighing of the evidence she was clearly wrong”:
    (para. 25). This is not the appropriate test at the secondary appellate level. The
    role of the Court of Appeal was to determine whether the reviewing judge had
    chosen and applied the correct standard of review, and in the event she had
    not, to assess the administrative body’s decision in light of the correct
    standard of review, reasonableness. At this stage in the analysis, the Court of
    Appeal is dealing with appellate review of a subordinate court, not judicial
    review of an administrative decision. As such, the normal rules of appellate
    review of lower courts as articulated in </span><em>Housen</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, </span><em>supra</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, apply. The
    question of the right standard to select and apply is one of law and,
    therefore, must be answered correctly by a reviewing judge. The Court of Appeal
    erred by affording deference where none was due.</span></p>

style='font-style:normal'>2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633. </span></em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>It is important to note that </span><em>Sattva</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> involved discussion of standard of review in the context
    of contractual interpretation and appellate review of a commercial arbitration
    award under British Columbia’s </span><em>Arbitration Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 55</span></em><span

    determined that the interpretation of the contract in issue did not raise an
    issue of law and leave ought not to have been granted. Nonetheless, it
    proceeded to consider the remaining questions raised on the appeal as if leave had
    been granted. This required a discussion of the standard of review applicable
    to the arbitral award. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Writing for the court, Rothstein J. described
    the differences between judicial review of administrative tribunal decisions
    and appeals of arbitral awards. Arbitrations are the product of mutual choice
    rather than statutory process and, unlike an administrative tribunal hearing, parties
    choose the identity and number of arbitrators. This meant that the judicial
    review framework developed in </span><em>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 was not entirely
    applicable in the context of a commercial arbitration. Nonetheless, there were
    some similarities: both involved a court review of a non-judicial
    decision-maker and expertise was a factor. Where parties choose their own
    decision-maker, it may be presumed that such decision-makers are chosen either
    based on their expertise in the area which is the subject of dispute or are
    otherwise qualified in a manner that is acceptable to the parties: para. 105. Accordingly,
    aspects of the </span><em>Dunsmuir </em><span class=MsoPageNumber>framework were
    helpful in determining the appropriate standard of review for commercial
    arbitration awards. </span><em>Dunsmuir</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> and
    other subsequent decisions confirmed that standard of review may be determined
    by focusing on the nature of the question at issue.  Rothstein J. went on to
    state:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>In the context of commercial
    arbitration, where appeals are restricted to questions of law, the standard of
    review will be reasonableness unless the question is one that would attract the
    correctness standard, such as constitutional questions or questions of law of
    central importance to the legal system as a whole and outside the adjudicator’s
    expertise (</span><em>Alberta Teachers’ Association</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, at para. 30).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leaving aside the issue of expertise, while arguably the two issues
    identified by the Appeal Judge as attracting a correctness standard did involve
    questions of general importance to the legal system as a whole, issue estoppel
    was the primary issue in dispute. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part of <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Revenue Properties’ argument
    on standard of review is</span></em> that the question of the application of <em>res
    judicata</em> including issue estoppel attracts a correctness standard because in
    the past, the Supreme Court has held that <em>res judicata</em> should be
    reviewed on a correctness standard. They rely on the decision in <em>Toronto
    (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79</em>, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 in support
    of this submission. They therefore argue that whenever a commercial arbitrator
    engages the doctrine of issue estoppel, the decision should be reviewed on a
    correctness standard.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with the approach suggested by <em><span style='font-style:
normal'>Revenue Properties</span></em>. The jurisprudence supports construing
    the issue being analyzed narrowly and in the particular circumstances of the
    case. That narrowly construed issue, not the application of a broadly stated
    legal doctrine, has to be of general importance to the legal system.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For instance, in <em>Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, 2011 SCC 53, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 471, the underlying issue
    was whether the Canadian Human Rights Commission had the power to award costs.
    In resolving that question, the court had to determine what standard of review
    applied to the Commission’s own analysis of the issue. The court concluded that
    a reasonableness standard applied. In determining whether the question at issue
    was one of general importance, the court did not just analyze it as a question
    about “costs” or even the ability of administrative tribunals to award costs.
    Rather, at paras. 24-27, the court construed the question narrowly (<em>i.e.</em> did this tribunal have the ability to award costs) and, therefore concluded
    that a reasonableness standard of review applied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And in <em>McLean v. British Columbia (Securities Commission), </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>2013 SCC 67, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 895</span></em>, the
    issue before the Supreme Court was whether the B.C. Securities Commission’s
    determination of a limitation period established by its enabling statute was to
    be reviewed on a correctness or reasonableness standard. The court concluded
    that it should be reviewed on a reasonableness standard. At para. 28, Moldaver
    J. stated that “although I agree that limitation periods, as a conceptual
    matter, are <em>generally</em> of central importance to the fair administration
    of justice, it does not follow that the Commission’s interpretation of <em>this</em> limitation period must be reviewed for its correctness” (emphasis in original).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I<em><span style='font-style:normal'>n</span></em><em> C.U.P.E., Local
    79</em>, the case Revenue Properties relies on, Arbour J. applied a correctness
    standard of review because a labour arbitrator had to resolve “complex common
    law rules and conflicting jurisprudence on the doctrines of <em>res judicata</em> and abuse of process – issues that are at the heart of the administration of
    justice.” In other words, the arbitrator was resolving those jurisprudential
    conflicts and articulating a general doctrine about <em>res judicata</em>, and
    was not simply deciding whether <em>res judicata</em> applied in the case at
    bar.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Majority considered well-established principles
    regarding issue estoppel. The arbitrators had to decide whether those
    principles, and the exceptions to them, <span class=Underline><span
style='text-decoration:none'>applied in this case</span></span>. In other
    words, the Majority only had to decide whether to apply well-established
    principles in this particular case. That does not attract a correctness
    standard and is not a legal question of general importance to the legal system
    as a whole. As such, a reasonableness standard applied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, even though the Appeal Judge failed to identify issue
    estoppel as attracting a reasonableness standard, that failure is of no moment.
    As I will explain, both he and the Majority were correct in concluding that <em>Musqueam</em> and <em>Revenue Properties #1</em> were consistent. However, the Majority ignored
    the restrictions in the <em>Condominium Act, 1998</em>.  The Act did not constitute
    a change in the law that permitted the Majority to avoid the application of
    issue estoppel and to include a potential freehold condominium project in the
    valuation. As a result, their decision was unreasonable. </p>

  <p class=MsoHeading7>(a)      Legal Principles</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Binnie J. explained in <em>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2001 SCC 44,</span></em><em> </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[2001] 2 S.C.R. 460</span></em>, at para. 25, the
    three preconditions  to the operation of issue estoppel are the following:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    the same question is being decided;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    the parties to the judicial decision are the same persons as the parties to the
    proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the key objectives of issue estoppel is judicial finality: “[t]he
    doctrine prevents an encore, and reflects the law’s refusal to tolerate
    needless litigation” (<i>per</i> Laskin J.A. in <em>Minott, </em>quoting from
    Holmstead and Watson, <i>Ontario Civil Procedure</i>, loose-leaf, vol. II, at
    s. 21. § 17[3]). More recently, the Supreme Court discussed issue estoppel in <em>Penner
    v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), </em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>2013 SCC 19, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 125,</span></em><i> </i>stating as
    follows, at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The one relevant [doctrine] on this appeal is the doctrine of
    issue estoppel. It balances judicial finality and economy and other
    considerations such as fairness to the parties. It holds that a party may not
    relitigate an issue that was finally decided in prior judicial proceedings
    between the same parties or those who stand in their place. However, even if
    these elements are present, the court retains discretion to not apply issue
    estoppel when its application would work an injustice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as noted by Laskin J.A. in <em>Minott</em>, at p. 340, courts
    have not mechanically applied the doctrine every time the preconditions for its
    application have been satisfied: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>That the courts have always exercised this discretion is
    apparent from the authorities. For example, courts have refused to apply issue
    estoppel in &quot;special circumstances&quot;, which include a change in the
    law or the availability of further relevant material. If the decision of a
    court on a point of law in an earlier proceeding is shown to be wrong by a
    later judicial decision, issue estoppel will not prevent relitigating that
    issue in subsequent proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the elements of issue estoppel are met;
    indeed, the College conceded as much. The parties are in essence the same, and
    the same language in the same leases is being interpreted. The question then is
    what did <em>Revenue Properties #1</em> decide and whether there is any basis
    (which may be characterized as special circumstances) for departing from <em>Revenue
    Properties #1</em>? </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Freehold or Leasehold Interest</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GE argues that
    both the Majority and the Appeal Judge erred by concluding that the Leases
    require a valuation of the freehold interest in the demised lands. In <i>Revenue
    Properties #1</i>, the Divisional Court concluded that the Leases required the
    valuation of lands subject to a lease and, according to GE, this means that the
    arbitrators should have valued the leasehold interest. It asks that the reasons
    of the minority arbitrator be adopted. Revenue Properties does not actively
    advance this argument but submits that if we agree with GE, then the same principles
    should govern the valuation of 131 as well. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The College, on
    the other hand, argues that there is no basis for GE’s position that the Leases
    require a leasehold valuation. It submits that this position has been
    consistently rejected in <em>Revenue Properties #1</em> as well as in <i>Musqueam </i>and other relevant authorities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no
    question that the leases provide little guidance on the meaning to be
    attributed to the ‘[FMV] of the demised lands’ and the evidence on surrounding
    circumstances or factual matrix is sparse. All of <em>Revenue Properties #1, Musqueam</em>,
    the Majority, and the Appeal Judge held that the freehold or fee simple
    interest was the subject matter of the valuation. I reject GE’s contention to
    the contrary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rationale
    that supports this interpretation has been repeated in the recitation of the
    dicta contained in the decisions I have outlined. They may be summarized as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>–   FMV is
    based on what a seller and buyer, each knowledgeable and willing, would pay for
    the lands on the open market.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>–<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Market value refers to the exchange value  calculated   by determining
    the ‘highest and best use’ possible at law.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>–      The
    fixing of rent in long-term leases as a percentage of the FMV reflects a
    formula by which a conservative investor seeks a modest return with maximum
    certainty and minimum risk.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>GE’s argument
    that <em>Revenue Properties #1</em><i> </i>provides for a leasehold valuation
    is the linchpin of its submissions on this issue. However, it cannot be
    accepted. Steele J. stated that the fact of a lease must be considered but
    notably that does not equate to a leasehold valuation. Steele J. held that the
    terms of the lease had to be ignored in a FMV valuation, a statement that is
    inconsistent with GE’s interpretation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither <em>Revenue
    Properties</em> nor any of the other relevant decisions suggest that the
    leasehold interest is to be valued or that the terms of the leases are to be
    considered in determining FMV. I see no reason to conclude otherwise. GE’s
    contention must be rejected. In summary, the freehold or fee simple interest is
    to be assessed, not the leasehold interest. The Appeal Judge was correct in
    accepting the Majority’s conclusion on this issue.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consideration of Freehold Condominium Development in FMV</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At least
    implicitly, the parties seem to agree that <em>Revenue Properties #1</em><i> </i>precludes
    including freehold condominiums in a valuation of the lands. I agree with that
    proposition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    College argues that we can depart from that holding and asks that we decline to
    apply issue estoppel for three reasons. First, it argues that <em>Revenue
    Properties #1</em><i> </i>has been undermined by <em>Musqueam</em><i> </i>and,
    therefore, we should decline to follow the former. Second, it argues that the <em>Condominium
    Act, 1998</em><i> </i>constitutes a change in the law sufficient to trigger an
    exception to issue estoppel. Third, relying on the Appeal Judge’s <em>de novo</em><i> </i>analysis, it argues that the justice of the case requires that we depart
    from <em>Revenue Properties #1</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Revenue
    Properties rejects the College’s submissions. It argues that the Appeal Judge
    correctly concluded that the Majority erred in departing from <i>Revenue
    Properties #1 </i>when it considered a freehold condominium project and that
    that decision was not undermined by <em>Musqueam</em>.  It submits that the
    Majority’s error in ignoring the restrictions in the <em>Condominium Act, 1998</em><i> </i>was so clear that its decision was unreasonable. It also submits that the
    Appeal Judge correctly concluded that his <em>de novo</em><i> </i>interpretation
    was not a basis for departing from the holding in <em>Revenue Properties #1</em>.
    GE supports these submissions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will address
    each of the three arguments advanced by the College. As I will explain, I would
    not give effect to any of them. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Musqueam</em> is not Inconsistent with <em>Revenue Properties #1</em>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Revenue
    Properties #1</em>, Steele and Adams JJ. both held that laws relating to the
    use of the lands affect the FMV of the lands. As the <em>Condominium Act</em> precluded freehold condominiums due to the existence of the leases, that law
    had an impact on FMV. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal Judge
    struggled to identify the basis for Steele J.’s conclusion on this issue. As
    noted, he preferred an interpretation that found that the Landlord could not
    benefit from a land use unavailable to the Tenants over an interpretation based
    on the practical impossibility of creating a condominium development on lands
    subject to a lease. While I am inclined towards the latter interpretation, it
    is unnecessary to choose one over the other. On either interpretation, the use
    of a freehold condominium project had to be excluded from the FMV determination. </p>

    submits that <em>Musqueam</em> changed the law in three important ways. The
    Supreme Court clarified the economic rationale underpinning rental reset
    clauses, introduced the notional sale principle, and introduced a rule of
    interpretation that requires express language in a contract before parties may
    derogate from the generally accepted meaning of FMV. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The economic
    rationale adopted in <em>Musqueam</em> was that articulated by Sexton J.A. in
    the Federal Court of Appeal and by Steele J. in <em>Revenue Properties #1</em> at p. 180: “The fixing of rent for long-term leases as a percentage of the
    market value of the land is a formula by which a conservative investor expects
    to receive, in return for accepting a modest return on his investment, a
    maximum of certainty and minimum of risk.” The stated economic rationale in <em>Musqueam</em> is similar to that expressed in <em>Revenue Properties #1</em>. By extension,
    the same is true with respect to the notional sale principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the third
    point, I do not read the decision as introducing any new rule of
    interpretation. <em>Musqueam</em> simply held that current land value (or in
    this case fair market value) meant freehold and not leasehold value. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Majority
    interpreted <em>Musqueam</em> as holding that the FMV of the freehold estate
    was to be assessed and also as acknowledging the economic rationale supporting
    such an approach. The Appeal Judge agreed with that view.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, in <i>Musqueam</i>, the Supreme Court held that the value in issue must reflect
    the legal restrictions on the land and on land use as opposed to restrictions
    found in the lease. This principle was adopted by both Gonthier J. and the
    Chief Justice. Where they parted company was in the application of that
    principle, namely, did being part of a reserve constitute a legal restriction
    within the ambit of this principle. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gonthier J., who
    wrote the plurality opinion, wrote as follows at para. 43: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>To find that off-reserve values should be used, the Federal
    Court of Appeal reasoned, in essence, that market value is established through
    the sale of land, and that once reserve land is sold it loses its reserve
    features, so that the relevant market is that for non-reserve land. With
    respect, I find this reasoning circular. The hypothesis of sale is taken as
    changing the nature of the land appraised from land on reserve to land off
    reserve, whereas the hypothetical used to establish market value in the absence
    of an actual market should reflect the land as it is in its actual
    circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Steele J.’s
    approach in <em>Revenue Properties #1</em><i> </i>was consistent with the
    passage cited above. He held that the demised lands had to be valued in their
    actual circumstances, i.e. lands subject to a lease (even if the exact terms of
    the lease were ignored). The “notional sale principle” adopted in <i>Musqueam</i> does not mean that this hypothetical sale should change the very nature of the Landlord’s
    asset. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Majority
    concluded at para. 112:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>We conclude that the demised lands should be appraised as
    vacant and without reference to ground leases as encumbrances, save to the
    extent that applicable statutes and laws affect the use of the lands because of
    the existence of the ground leases.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, <em>Musqueam</em> did not provide a basis on which to depart from the holding in <em>Revenue
    Properties #1</em>. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='

style='font-style:normal'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The <em>Condominium Act, 1998</em> does not Justify a
    Departure from <em>Revenue Properties #1</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings me
    to the change in the condominium legislation in Ontario. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I will
    explain, I agree with the Tenants’ argument that the <em>Condominium Act, 1998</em><i> </i>does not constitute a change in the law. Accordingly, such special
    circumstances did not exist to avoid the application of issue estoppel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall that all
    of <em>Revenue Properties #1</em>, <em>Musqueam</em> and the Majority (at para.
    111 and 112 cited above) agreed that legal restrictions affecting land use will
    be part of the FMV determination.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Condominium
    Act</em> allowed condominium development but not on leased lands. The Act
    related to and affected the use of the lands because it precluded the
    establishment of freehold condominiums on leased lands. As such, the fact of
    the leases had a detrimental effect on value. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Condominium
    Act, 1998</em>, does not allow for freehold condominium development on leased
    lands. It now only permits leasehold condominium development on leased lands. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As such, the
    relevant land restriction in place in 1990 (i.e. the inability to develop
    freehold condominiums) is still in place. The evidence does not support the
    Majority’s treatment of freehold condominiums and leasehold condominiums as being
    the same. Therefore, the <em>Condominium Act, 1998</em><i> </i>does not
    constitute a change in the law sufficient to justify a departure from issue
    estoppel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The FMV
    assessment is to consider the application of land use legislation. The cases
    that speak of the valuation being done without reference to the lease (or the
    restricted use found in a lease) refer to the terms of the lease and not to the
    existence of a lease. The fact of the matter is that given the presence of the
    leases, the Landlord was unable to develop freehold condominiums. This limits
    the highest and best use that was “legally permissible, physically possible,
    financially feasible, and maximally productive” of which Gonthier J. wrote in <i>Musqueam</i>.
    The issue in both <i>Revenue Properties #1</i> and the Majority Award is not
    what use the Tenants could put the lands to as the Appeal Judge interpreted <i>Revenue
    Properties #1</i> (and particularly Adams J.’s commentary), but whether the
    condominium statutes imposed any restrictions on land use given the fact of the
    long-term leases. In this sense, it would be wholly unfair for the Landlord to
    benefit from a value divorced from the basis of the landlord and tenant relationship
    and the nature of the precise agreement that it had entered into with the
    Tenants. This analysis does not extend to include a consideration of the terms
    of the leases, simply the fact of the leases.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is worth
    recalling that Steele J. in <em>Revenue Properties #1 </em>considered that the Leases
    diminished the value of the land and, at p. 183, that the “lease had a
    detrimental effect on the value of the lands” because the <em>Condominium Act</em><i> </i>did not permit condominiums on lands subject to a lease. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Leases
    continue to have a detrimental effect on the value of the lands, and the
    ability to construct leasehold condominiums does not negate that effect. The
    Majority never considered whether leasehold condominiums could be the same for
    valuation purposes as freehold condominiums. As noted by Revenue Properties,
    the evidence presented at the arbitration indicated that they could not. For
    instance, expert evidence provided by the respondent Revenue Properties contains
    an effective overview of the detrimental effect of a lease:<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The concept of a land lease raises concerns in the minds of
    both developers and purchasers in condominium developments. A lease introduces
    an unusual element into the consideration of the purchase of a condominium and
    its ultimate viability. From a developer’s perspective, there are no obvious
    advantages to a ground lease. There are many disadvantages. Land leases
    typically are used where the vendor would like to generate immediate revenue
    from a property but is unwilling to give up its long term interest. For public
    and private institutions that see their land assets as a long term annuity,
    leasing is a common strategy. Leasing land for the purposes of developing
    condominiums is very rare in the Greater Toronto Area given complex market issues
    that can reduce the feasibility of a project and a good supply of land that is
    available on a fee simple basis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Majority did
    not address these issues or the relevant evidence. Its analysis on the
    condominium issue was extremely brief and, after rejecting the dissenting
    arbitrator’s opinion that the terms of the lease should be considered, they simply
    asserted that a freehold condominium project can be considered in the fair
    market value analysis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it
    was unreasonable for the Majority to consider a freehold condominium project in
    their valuation and the Appeal Judge was correct in so finding. It follows that
    to the extent that the Majority implicitly concluded that the <em>Condominium
    Act, 1998</em><i> </i>effected a change in the law relevant to the valuation
    exercise, this too was unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying Issue Estoppel<i> </i>does not Produce an Injustice </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as
    noted, the Appeal Judge concluded that, if he were free to conduct a <em>de
    novo</em><i> </i>interpretation of the Leases, he would conclude that <em>Revenue
    Properties #1</em> (as interpreted by him) was wrongly decided. However, he
    still proceeded to apply issue estoppel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
    definitively deciding the issue, I would not necessarily endorse the Appeal
    Judge’s <em>de novo</em><i> </i>interpretation. As I have discussed, in my
    view, <em>Musqueam</em><i> </i>and the notional sale principle articulated
    therein do not require that we ignore the nature of the asset that is being
    valued. In this case, the nature of that asset is a freehold estate that is
    subject to a lease. There is a live issue as to whether the issue is examined
    from the Landlord’s or the Tenants’ statutorily restricted use. However, here
    this distinction made no difference as neither could construct freehold
    condominiums on lands subject to a lease.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In any event, I would not interfere with the Appeal Judge’s
    discretionary decision to apply issue estoppel. The test for the application of
    issue estoppel was met and the doctrine was applicable. No special or changed
    circumstances arose nor was there any injustice in this outcome. W<span
class=MsoPageNumber>hile it is true that the rent was to be reset every twenty
    or thirty years, the interpretation of the leases should as a matter of
    principle be caught by issue estoppel and an encore should be prevented: see </span><em>Minott, </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>at p. 329</span></em><em>.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> Just because the rent payable under the Leases will
    be reset again in the future does not mean that litigation on the same issue
    between the same parties should be permitted. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Preventing such an outcome</span></em><span
class=MsoPageNumber> is the foundational purpose that supports the doctrine of
    issue estoppel. Parties to litigation should be entitled to expect certainty
    and to be able to deal with others, including third parties, in the confidence
    that the legal precedent established by a prior judicial procedure will be left
    undisturbed. Lastly, I agree with Revenue Properties’ submission that the fact
    that a different judge may have come to a different outcome is not a basis for
    declining to follow a final decision that would otherwise bind the parties. </span></p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Appeal Judge err in Refusing to Return the Dispute to a new
    Arbitral Panel?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are three
    issues to address on the matter of remedy: (1) the applicable standard of
    review; (2) whether the Appeal Judge had the power to remit the FMV dispute to
    a new panel; and (3) whether the dispute should have been remitted to a new
    panel.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(i)       Standard of Review</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appeal
    Judge’s decision declining the request to remit the dispute to a new arbitral
    panel was discretionary in nature: see, for example, <em>Popack v. Lipszyc</em>,
    2016 ONCA 135, 129 O.R. (3d) 321. Indeed, this is conceded by Revenue
    Properties. Absent an error of law, a material misrepresentation or a clearly
    wrong result, a discretionary decision attracts deference.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)      Power to Remit to New Panel</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal
    errors identified by Revenue Properties and GE are that: (a) the Appeal Judge
    erred in concluding that s. 45 of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> did not support
    the removal of the arbitral panel given that the Tenants did not raise s. 46,
    and (b) the Appeal Judge applied the wrong test and that a new panel ought to
    have been ordered to ensure that “justice was seen as being done”.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Revenue Properties
    and GE argue that the power to remit to a new arbitral panel resides in both s.
    45(5) and 46(7) of the Act. The Appeal Judge disagreed.  In my view, the Appeal
    Judge erred in law in his interpretation of the Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Revenue
    Properties and GE did not apply pursuant to s. 46, but under s.&nbsp;45. I
    accept that sections 45 and 46 represent two different legal remedies for two
    different problems. Section 45 is an appeal provision for addressing legally
    incorrect awards whereas s. 46 provides for applications to address awards
    tainted by procedural or jurisdictional irregularities.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
    in s. 45(5) that would preclude the power advocated by the Tenants. Section
    45(5) provides the court with the power to remit the award to an arbitral tribunal
    and to “give directions about the conduct of the arbitration”.  Arbitral
    tribunal is not defined in the Act and nothing in s. 45(5), or in the Act read
    as a whole, requires the court to return the matter to the same arbitral
    tribunal.  The ability of the court to give directions is also not limited in
    scope.  Furthermore, while I recognize the need for efficiency and cost
    effectiveness in the arbitral regime, it would be strange for an appeal scheme
    to omit provision for a power of remittal to a new panel. This does not mean
    that every time an appeal is allowed, remittal to a new panel is required; it
    is just one option available to the appellate authority. Put differently, the
    power exists in s. 45(5) of the Act but it need not be invariably exercised. When
    contemplating whether to exercise such a power, the principles of efficiency,
    cost-effectiveness and fairness to the parties should all be considered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for authority
    based on a common law power, the Appeal Judge relied on <em>United Nurses of
    Alberta (UNA), Local No. 34 v. Didsbury General and Auxiliary Hospital and
    Nursery Home District #33</em> (1996), 150 A.R. 81 (Q.B.), in support of the
    existence of a common law power separate and distinct from that found in the <i>Arbitration
    Act</i>. However, the court in that case relied on the wording of an Alberta
    statute to ground the exercise of a common law power. Here, no such similar
    authority was identified. Moreover, review of commercial arbitration awards
    occur in a tightly-defined regime: see <em>Sattva</em> at para. 104. As Brian
    Casey states in <i>Arbitration Law of Canada; Practice and Procedure</i>, 2nd
    ed. (Huntingdon, New York: Juris Publishing Inc., 2012), at p. 414 of his text:
    “The prerogative remedies usually associated with judicial review do not apply
    to consensual arbitration.”  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I
    would conclude that, contrary to the Appeal Judge’s determination, common law
    authority did not exist. The provisions of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> governed.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iii)     Merits</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the light of his
    legal errors relating to the requisite statutory or common law authority,
    deference is not owed to the Appeal Judge’s decision on remedy.  It therefore falls
    to this court to identify the appropriate remedy.  Having said that,  I agree
    with the factors considered by the Appeal Judge and indeed, his disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In rendering his

    necessary or appropriate to receive new appraisal reports.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A denial of natural justice was not raised on the appeal before him and</p>

    matter. There is good reason to retain the benefit of such knowledge. It will ensure
    an expeditious and informed determination of the arbitration. There must
    therefore be a real concern for an inability to conduct an impartial
    arbitration before the Court will consider ordering that a new arbitration
    panel be convened. The Tenants can establish no more than a possibility. That
    is insufficient in the present circumstances.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, I
    agree with these observations. I would also add that the arbitration consumed
    40 days of hearing and involved 20 witnesses. Consistent with the interests of
    justice and the principles of efficiency and cost effectiveness that
    characterize the arbitral model of decision making, this dispute should be remitted
    to the existing panel.  I would add that such a disposition does not preclude
    the existing panel, for reasons of availability or otherwise, from determining
    that a new panel will have to be constituted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[149]<span
