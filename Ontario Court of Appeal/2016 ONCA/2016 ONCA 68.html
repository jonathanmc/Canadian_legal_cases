  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the scope of the privilege in s. 36 of the <em>Investment
    Canada Act</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> (the “<em>ICA</em>”) over information obtained by the Minister of Industry<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> or an officer or employee of Her Majesty in the course of the administration
    and enforcement of the <em>ICA</em>. The <em>ICA</em> provides for the review
    of significant investments in Canada by non-Canadians. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>U.S. Steel Canada Inc. (“USSC”) is subject to protection under the<i> <em>Companies’
    Creditors Arrangement Act</em></i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> (the “<em>CCAA</em>”). Stakeholders in the <em>CCAA</em> proceedings brought a
    motion for disclosure of the contents of a settlement agreement arrived at in
    the course of litigation to enforce the <em>ICA</em> (the “Settlement
    Agreement”). The Settlement Agreement was entered into by USSC, its American
    parent, United States Steel Corporation (“USS”), and the Attorney General of Canada
    (on behalf of Industry Canada<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a>)
    (the “AGC”) on December 8, 2011. It contains written undertakings provided by
    USS to the Minister for the purposes of the <em>ICA</em>. The central issue is
    whether s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em> bars this disclosure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CCAA</em> judge concluded that the Settlement Agreement was
    privileged in its entirety under s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em>. Because he so
    concluded, he did not consider whether the Settlement Agreement was protected
    by common law settlement privilege. He dismissed the motion of four key
    stakeholders – the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing,
    Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (“USW”), the
    court-appointed Representative Counsel to the non-USW active and retired
    employees of USSC, USW Local 1005 and the City of Hamilton – seeking production
    of the Settlement Agreement. They appeal the dismissal of their motion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em> does
    not prohibit USSC and USS from disclosing the Settlement Agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would return the issue of whether disclosure of the Settlement
    Agreement is barred by common law settlement privilege to the <em>CCAA</em> judge for determination in the exercise of his discretion in the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding. As the <em>CCAA</em> judge did not have the Settlement Agreement
    before him, I would direct the monitor of USSC, Ernst &amp; Young Inc. (the
    “Monitor”), to disclose the Settlement Agreement to the <em>CCAA</em> judge so
    that he may review it and, if he deems it helpful, entertain further
    submissions by the parties before determining this issue.</p>

page-break-after:avoid'>II<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>USS is a publicly-traded Delaware corporation and one of the largest
    steel producers in North America. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2007, USS purchased Stelco Inc., a Canadian steel company with
    facilities in the City of Hamilton and in Nanticoke, Ontario. Stelco had
    emerged from <em>CCAA</em> protection in 2006. The acquisition was subject to
    the review and approval of the Minister under Part IV of the <em>ICA</em>. The
    review process under Part IV is intended to ensure that a proposed investment
    by a non-Canadian company is likely to be of net benefit to Canada.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>USS was given permission to purchase Stelco after it gave certain
    undertakings to the Minister in respect of the acquisition. The undertakings
    included commitments by USS in respect of production and employment levels in
    Canada. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>USS renamed Stelco, calling it U.S. Steel Canada Inc., and remains its
    ultimate owner. USSC faced financial difficulties in 2008, apparently due to
    the global recession. In 2009, the Minister sent a demand to USS pursuant to s.
    39 of the <em>ICA</em>, claiming that USS was in contravention of the
    employment and production undertakings, and requesting that USS remedy the
    alleged defaults, show that there was no default, or justify any
    non-compliance. USS denied any non-compliance with the undertakings for which
    it could be held accountable. USS took the position that any inability to meet
    its objectives was the result of factors beyond its control for which it could
    not be held responsible.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 17, 2009, the AGC filed an application under s. 40 of the <em>ICA</em>,
    seeking an order directing USS to comply with the undertakings and to pay
    certain penalties for any breach. The appellant, the USW, among others, was
    given intervener status in the application. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    litigation was ultimately settled without any judicial finding on the merits
    when USS, USSC, and the AGC entered into the Settlement Agreement. Some details
    of the Settlement Agreement have been publicly disclosed, including the fact
    that it contains new written undertakings provided by USS to the Minister for
    the purposes of the <em>ICA</em>. Some of the new undertakings were publicly
    announced, such as USS’s commitment to continue producing steel in Canada, to
    maintain some of its Ontario operations until the end of 2015, and to make
    certain capital investments. The Settlement Agreement requires that the balance
    of its terms be kept confidential and the details are not otherwise publicly
    available. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of continuing financial difficulties, USSC applied for and was granted <em>CCAA</em> protection on September 16, 2014. In an affidavit filed in
    support of its application, USSC referred to the Settlement Agreement and
    asserted that its confidentiality was protected both by the terms of the
    agreement and s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em>. Ernst &amp; Young Inc. was appointed
    as the Monitor of USSC. USS has filed claims in the USSC claims process for
    amounts it alleges are owed by USSC, including unsecured claims of over $1.9
    billion and a secured claim of over $78 million.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Monitor has a copy of the Settlement Agreement. On January 7, 2015, counsel for
    the USW requested disclosure of the Settlement Agreement from the Monitor, if
    the parties would consent. The Monitor was told on January 23, 2015 that the
    parties would not agree to disclose the Settlement Agreement and took the
    position that it could not disclose it without consent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 10, 2015, the appellants brought the motion below in the <em>CCAA</em> proceedings, seeking an order to compel Industry Canada, USS and/or USSC to
    disclose the Settlement Agreement and, in particular, the undertakings contained
    therein. Their position was that the information sought was relevant to an
    assessment of restructuring proposals being made by stakeholders, and would
    permit them to participate in the restructuring process on a fully informed
    basis. In particular, they submitted that USS had continuing obligations under
    the Settlement Agreement that would need to be addressed in any restructuring,
    such as continuing to produce steel at the Canadian plants and continuing to
    make certain capital investments. They also believe that the Settlement
    Agreement would disclose breaches of the undertakings, which they would rely on
    to object to the status of the USS claims against USSC. The City of Hamilton
    filed evidence of the financial importance to it of USSC’s Hamilton works. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    letter dated April 17, 2015, the Director General of the Investment Review
    Division of Industry Canada advised the parties that the Minister’s delegate,
    appointed pursuant to s. 6 of the <em>ICA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    had reviewed the Settlement Agreement and come to the opinion that </span></em>disclosure
    of the Settlement Agreement was not necessary for any purpose relating to the
    administration or enforcement of the <em>ICA</em> and that such disclosure
    would prejudicially affect the conduct of USS’s business affairs. This
    determination is contemplated by the privilege regime in s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em>,
    discussed below. The letter also stated that the Settlement Agreement required
    the parties to maintain it as confidential, save for the details that were already
    publicly disclosed. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    reviewing the <em>CCAA</em> judge’s reasons, it is helpful to briefly outline
    both the purposes and relevant portions of the framework of the <em>ICA</em>,
    as well as the structure of s. 36 and how it interfaces with the <em>Access to
    Information Act</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. A-1 (the “<em>ATIA</em>”). Section 36 is
    reproduced in Schedule “A” to these reasons, together with some of the other
    sections of the <em>ICA</em> referred to below. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Purposes of the <em>ICA</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2 of the <em>ICA</em> provides that its purposes “are to provide for the review
    of significant investments in Canada by non-Canadians in a manner that
    encourages investment, economic growth and employment opportunities in Canada
    and to provide for the review of investments in Canada by non-Canadians that
    could be injurious to national security”. </p>
  <p class=Heading>The Review Process</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part
    II of the <em>ICA</em> exempts certain investments from its application (s. 10).
    In the case of certain other investments not exempted by Part II, Part III of
    the <em>ICA</em> requires only that the non-Canadian making the investment give
    notice of its investment and provide the information prescribed in that Part
    (ss. 11-13). Part IV requires that, in a narrower category of “reviewable”
    investments, the non-Canadian satisfy the Minister that the investment is
    likely to be of net benefit to Canada. USS’s investment in USSC was a
    reviewable investment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    an investment is reviewable under Part IV, the non-Canadian must file an
    application with the Director containing “such information as is prescribed”
    (s. 17(1)). The Director may request that the non-Canadian provide any other
    information the Director considers necessary (s. 17(3)). The Director then
    refers to the Minister any of the following material obtained in the course of
    the review: the information contained in the application and any other
    information submitted by the applicant; any information submitted by the person
    or entity from whom or which control of the business is being or has been
    acquired; any written undertakings to Her Majesty in right of Canada given by
    the applicant; and any representations submitted to the Director by an affected
    province (s. 19(1)). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the Minister is satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to
    Canada “having taken into account any information, undertakings and
    representations referred to the Minister by the Director”, then, subject to
    certain exceptions, the Minister must give notice of that evaluation to the
    applicant within a specified time period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the Minister is not so satisfied, he or she is required to give notice to that
    effect to the applicant, who then has the opportunity to make representations
    and submit undertakings to Her Majesty in right of Canada. The Minister will
    take those further representations and undertakings into account in making the
    decision (s. 23). </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enforcement
    mechanisms are set out in Part VII of the <em>ICA</em>. If the Minister
    believes that a non-Canadian has failed to comply with a written undertaking
    given to Her Majesty in right of Canada relating to an investment that the
    Minister is satisfied or is deemed to be satisfied is likely to be of net
    benefit to Canada, the Minister may send a demand to the non-Canadian requiring
    it to remedy the default (s. 39(1)). If the non-Canadian fails to comply, the
    Minister may apply to a superior court for an order directing the non-Canadian
    to comply with the written undertaking (s. 40(1)). As discussed above, the
    Minister sent a demand to USS and subsequently commenced an application under
    s. 40(1). The Settlement Agreement was concluded before the Minister’s
    application was judicially determined. The Settlement Agreement was clearly
    concluded in the course of the enforcement of the <em>ICA</em>.</p>

    36 is in Part VI of the <em>ICA</em>, which is entitled “General”. While it is
    reproduced in its entirety in Schedule “A” to these reasons, for ease of
    reference, ss. 36(1) and (2) provide as follows: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>36(1) Subject to subsections (3) to (4), <span class=Underline>all

  <p class=CQuote>(2) Notwithstanding any other Act or law but subject to

    proceedings relating to the administration or enforcement of [the <em>ICA</em>]”;
    para. (b), which excepts “information contained in any written undertaking

    required to disclose the new undertakings to the appellants under s. 36(4)(b).</p>
  <p class=Heading>The <em>ATIA</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>ATIA</em> provides a right of access to information in records under the
    control of a government institution. However, that right is not absolute and
    the <em>ATIA</em><i> </i>contains various exceptions. One exception is s. 24(1),
    which provides that, where a record “contains information the disclosure of
    which is restricted by or pursuant to any provision set out in Schedule II”, the
    head of a government institution shall refuse to disclose it. Section 36 of the <em>ICA</em> is one of the provisions contained in Schedule II. Therefore, if a
    record contains information the disclosure of which is prohibited by s. 36, the
    Minister shall not disclose it in response to a request made under the <em>ATIA</em><i>. </i>The statutory privilege provided for in s. 36 is therefore absolute,
    subject to the exceptions set out therein, and cannot be circumvented by resort
    to the <em>ATIA</em>.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CCAA</em> judge noted at the outset of his reasons that the
    appellants abandoned their argument that the Settlement Agreement did not
    constitute “information”. Instead, they argued that the undertakings contained
    in the Settlement Agreement did not constitute “information” and were therefore
    not privileged under s. 36(1). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CCAA</em> judge concluded that “information” in s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em> covers
    undertakings given by USS to the Minister, including any undertakings in the
    Settlement Agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    explained, at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[B]ecause the term “information”, as used in these provisions,
    is intended to capture all information provided by a prospective foreign
    investor to the Crown in the course of the administration and enforcement of
    the <em>ICA</em>, including in particular in the course of the approval
    process, it must also include undertakings given in connection with that
    process. This conclusion is supported [by] both the broad language of these provisions
    as well as by the policy of the [<em>ICA</em>].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his view, undertakings are statements of fact regarding a commitment that the
    foreign investor is making to the Minister, as well as a contractual obligation
    (para. 28), and are therefore “information”. He rejected the appellants’
    arguments that written undertakings accepted by the Minister and undertakings
    provided in the enforcement context should be distinguished from undertakings
    not accepted by the Minister in the approval process and are not “information”
    for the purposes of the <em>ICA</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CCAA</em> judge also rejected the appellants’ alternative
    argument that, even if the undertakings are “information” for the purposes of ss.
    36(1) and 36(2), they do not constitute “information” for the purposes of the
    exemptions in s. 36(4). The basis for this argument is s. 36(4)(b), which
    provides an exclusion from the non-disclosure regime for “information contained
    in any written undertaking” except to the extent the Minister determines
    otherwise under s. 36(5). The appellants argued that this provision makes it clear
    that “information” and a “written undertaking” are different. While the <em>CCAA</em> judge acknowledged that it was possible to interpret the provisions in the
    manner proposed by the appellants on a reading of the <em>ICA</em> limited to
    the wording in paragraph 36(4)(b), he was not persuaded that this
    interpretation was correct based on a consideration of the provisions of s. 36
    as a whole, as well as the purposes of the <em>ICA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CCAA</em><i> </i>judge held that the structure of s. 36 required that the
    written undertaking contemplated in s. 36(4)(b) be treated as a reference to a
    document containing one or more undertakings, rather than to the contractual
    commitments themselves. This, he concluded, parallels the language of s. 36(2),
    which refers to “a statement or other writing containing such information”. And
    it is also consistent with his interpretation of s. 36(5). In his view, s. 36(5)
    was intended to apply to all information contained in any document to which s.
    36(4)(b) would otherwise apply, including the undertakings given to the
    Minister. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    then dealt with the questions of whether Industry Canada, USS, and USSC were
    subject to the non-disclosure regime in s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em>, and if they
    were, whether he could order production using the court’s broad order-making
    powers under s. 11 of the <em>CCAA</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    36(1) provides that “no one shall knowingly communicate” information obtained
    by the Crown in the administration or enforcement of the <em>ICA</em>. As such,
    the <em>CCAA</em> judge reasoned that, subject to the operation of the limited
    statutory exceptions in s. 36, Industry Canada, USS and USSC are subject to
    this statutory obligation of confidentiality. The <em>CCAA</em> judge found that
    the exceptions did not apply in this case: the exception in s. 36(4)(a) did not
    apply because the legal proceedings here were under the <em>CCAA</em> and not under
    the <em>ICA</em>; the exception in s. 36(4)(b) did not apply because the
    Minister’s delegate’s opinion was unfavourable to disclosure; and the exception
    in s. 36(4)(d) did not apply because USSC’s reference to the Settlement
    Agreement in its application for <em>CCAA</em> protection did not constitute
    express or implied authorization by USSC or USS to disclosure of the
    information. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CCAA</em> judge declined to exercise the authority granted to the court
    under s. 11 of the <em>CCAA</em> to order disclosure, on the grounds that the
    court could not override the operation of the <i>ICA </i>statutory scheme. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    his conclusion that the regime in s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em> applied, the <em>CCAA</em> judge declined to address the appellants’ submission that, if the Settlement
    Agreement, or at least the undertakings contained in it, were not governed by
    s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em><i>, </i>the common law settlement privilege was
    displaced by the public interest in disclosure. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit that the undertakings in the Settlement Agreement
    are not privileged under s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em>. They argue that s. 36(1)
    only protects information obtained by the Minister for the purpose of
    determining whether or not to approve a proposed investment, and has no
    application to the Settlement Agreement, which arose out of a settlement of
    post-acquisition litigation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants further argue that the <em>CCAA</em> judge erred in conflating
    “information” and “undertaking” for the purposes of s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span> </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>since </span></em>“information” and “undertaking” are used as discrete terms
    throughout the <em>ICA</em>, including in s. 36(4)(b). They say that an
    undertaking is not a contractual obligation and a “statement of fact”; it is
    simply a promise. They cite <em>Kitchenham v. AXA Insurance (Canada)</em>,<i> </i>2008
    ONCA 877, 94 O.R. (3d) 276, at para. 26, where this court defined an
    undertaking as follows: “[a]n undertaking is a promise given by one party to
    another party to the lawsuit in exchange for obtaining something from that
    party.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject the appellants’ arguments, and find that the <em>CCAA</em> judge did not
    err in concluding that the privilege in s. 36(1) attaches to information
    obtained by the Minister in connection with the enforcement of the <em>ICA</em> and that undertakings contained in the Settlement Agreement are “information”
    for the purposes of s. 36. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ first argument regarding the scope of s. 36(1) is largely
    underpinned by the observation of <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Prothonotary
    Milczynski in </span>Canada (Attorney General) v. United States Steel Corp.</em>,
    2009 CarswellNat 5932 (Fed. T.D.), at para. 16, that “[i]nformation is provided
    to the Minister of Industry and Investment Canada under various provisions of
    the [<em>ICA</em>] for the purposes of allowing the Minister to determine
    whether or not a proposed investment is ‘likely to be of net benefit to Canada’”.
    However, that observation does not purport to be a comprehensive legal
    determination of the scope of s. 36(1) of the <em>ICA</em>. In my view,
    interpreting s. 36(1) to provide that the privilege only attaches to information
    obtained by the Minister for the purpose of determining whether or not to
    approve an investment ignores the words “in the course of the … enforcement of
    this Act”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the appellants’ second argument, despite the use of “information” and
    “undertaking” as discrete terms in Part IV of the <em>ICA</em>, I agree with
    the <em>CCAA</em> judge’s conclusion that, in s. 36 in Part VI of the <em>ICA</em>,
    Parliament intended “information” to include undertakings set out in a document
    given to the Minister. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This issue has long been settled<i>. </i>As the respondents submit, <em>Hamilton
    v. Canada (Attorney General) </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1984),
    28 B.L.R. 92 (Fed. T.D.)</span></em> determined over 30 years ago that
    undertakings provided by a non-Canadian constituted “information” for the
    purpose of s. 14(1) of the <em>Foreign Investment Review Act</em>, S.C.
    1973-74, c. 46, as amended (“<em>FIRA</em>”). <em>FIRA</em> was the predecessor
    to the <em>ICA</em><i>,</i> and s. 14 of <em>FIRA</em> was the equivalent of s.
    36 of the <i>ICA.</i> Section 14(1) of <em>FIRA</em> provided that “all information
    with respect to a person, business or proposed business obtained by the
    Minister … in the course of the administration of this Act is privileged”. Like
    s. 36(4)(b) of the <em>ICA</em>, s. 14(4)(c) excepted from the privilege regime
    “information contained in any written undertaking”. Section 14(4) also provided
    for an “exception to the exception”, similar to that contained in s. 36(5) of
    the <em>ICA</em>, pursuant to which the Minister did not have to disclose any
    information referred to in s. 14(4)(c) where the disclosure was not necessary
    for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the Act and
    would prejudicially affect the person who gave the undertaking. And, like the <em>ICA</em>,
    in other sections of <em>FIRA</em>, “information” and “undertakings” were used
    as discrete terms.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span

    which was ultimately enacted as the <em>ICA</em><i> </i>and replaced <em>FIRA</em>,<i> </i>opposition members criticized the “secrecy” inherent in the investment
    review process under <em>FIRA</em><i> </i>and moved to amend the Bill to
    provide for greater public access to information under the <em>ICA</em>. They
    noted that, without further amendment, the <em>ICA</em><i> </i>would suffer
    from the same problems that existed under <em>FIRA</em>: for example, see <em>House
    of Commons Debates</em>, 33rd Parl., 1st Sess., Vol. 3 (1 May 1985), at 4298,
    4305 and 4313 (Hon. Vic Althouse, Hon. Jim Manly and Hon. Nelson A. Riis) (“<em>ICA</em><i> </i>Debates”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    of the proposed amendments would have required the Minister, under the <em>ICA</em>,
    to make public all undertakings given by the investor once it was determined
    that the proposed investment would be of net benefit to Canada: <em>ICA</em><i> </i>Debates, at 4242. The legislature ultimately voted to defeat the amendments: <em>ICA</em><i> </i>Debates, at 4313. This demonstrates the legislature’s
    intention to continue the privilege scheme that extended to undertakings under <em>FIRA</em>,
    such that undertakings would be confidential unless an exception applied. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with the appellants that s. 36(4)(b) (“information contained
    in any written undertaking”) makes it clear that “information” and
    “undertaking” are different and that undertakings set out in a document given
    to the Minister are therefore not “information” for the purpose of s. 36. The
    appellants’ interpretation of s. 36(4)(b) would distinguish between what they
    would characterize as the bare promise made to the Minister and information contained
    in the promise – the written undertaking – to the Minister. The appellants
    would permit USS to assert privilege over the information contained in the
    written undertaking, but not over the “bare promise” itself. They would require
    USS to parse each written undertaking to sever what they would characterize as
    the bare promise provided to the Minister from any information contained in the
    written undertaking. Where is the line between “information” and “bare
    promise”? And without the information contained in the written undertaking, would
    disclosure of the bare promise be meaningful? In my view, the appellants’
    interpretation of s. 36(4)(b) does not bear scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As
    I discuss below, I agree with the <em>CCAA</em> judge that “written
    undertaking” in s. 36(4)(b) defines the location of the privileged information
    and does not define the scope of “information” for the purposes of s. 36. Section
    36(4)(b) therefore does not make it clear that undertakings are not information
    for the purposes of s. 36. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    because I conclude below that the exception to the privilege regime in s.
    36(4)(b) applies to USSC and USS, such that they are not prohibited from
    disclosing the Settlement Agreement, the result of this appeal does not turn on
    whether “information” in s. 36 includes “undertakings”. </p>

    proceedings relating to the administration or enforcement of [the <em>ICA</em>]”.
    They argue that the <em>CCAA</em> judge failed to consider that the words

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this argument. I agree with the <em>CCAA</em><i> </i>judge that s.
    36(4)(a) does not apply in these circumstances. Here, disclosure of the
    information is sought by the appellants for the purposes of the current proceedings
    under the <em>CCAA</em>. It is not sought for legal proceedings relating to the
    enforcement of the <em>ICA</em>, and it is not sought by the Minister, who is
    the party charged with the administration and enforcement of the <em>ICA</em>. Indeed,
    the Minister has stated his opinion that disclosure of the information was not
    necessary for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the <em>ICA</em>.
     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='color:black'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This case is very different from <em>Slattery</em>. In <em>Slattery</em>,
    Revenue Canada sought to collect income tax owing by Mr. Slattery. After
    conducting a lengthy investigation into his affairs, it petitioned Mr. Slattery
    (“the bankrupt”) into bankruptcy in order to collect the income tax owing. The
    trustee in bankruptcy then commenced civil proceedings against the bankrupt’s
    wife, seeking a declaration that certain assets held in her name were, in
    reality, property of the bankrupt's estate.<span style='color:black'> The
    trustee sought to introduce testimony from Revenue Canada officials involved in
    the earlier investigation of the bankrupt’s affairs. Counsel for Mrs. Slattery
    objected on the ground that such testimony was statutorily barred in accordance
    with s. 241 of the </span><em>Income Tax Act</em><span style='color:black'>,
    R.S.C. 1952, c. 148, as amended by S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 63 (the “</span><em>Income
    Tax Act</em><span style='color:black'>”), which prohibited Revenue Canada
    officials from disclosing information obtained from a taxpayer for the purposes
    of that Act. The trial judge held that the testimony was not barred due to an exception
    under the </span><em>Income Tax Act</em><span style='color:black'> stating that
    the prohibition did not apply “in respect of proceedings relating to the
    administration or enforcement of [the </span><em>Income Tax Act</em><span
style='color:black'>]”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada held that disclosure of the
    information obtained by Revenue Canada during its investigation for the
    purposes of the trustee’s bankruptcy action was permissible because the bankruptcy
    proceedings could be clearly characterized as “relating to” the enforcement of
    the <em>Income Tax Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Characterizing
    the bankruptcy proceedings as &quot;proceedings relating to the ... enforcement
    of&quot; the <em>Income Tax Act</em> made sense in <em>Slattery</em>. Revenue
    Canada was the party who petitioned the taxpayer into bankruptcy, it was
    actively involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, and the tax officials and the
    bankruptcy trustee were collaborating. Revenue Canada was entitled to volunteer
    to disclose the disputed (otherwise confidential) information in order to
    enforce the <em>Income Tax Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    this case, the two sets of proceedings in <em>Slattery</em> were interrelated.
    Here, they are not. Other than the privilege issue, the Minister has no
    interest in the <em>CCAA</em> proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    36(4)(a) therefore does not permit the appellants to obtain disclosure of any
    information contained in the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <h5 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 36(4)(b)</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    36(4)(b) provides that s. 36 does not prohibit disclosure of:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) information <span class=Underline>contained</span> in any
    written undertaking given to her Majesty in right of Canada relating to an
    investment that the Minister is satisfied or is deemed to be satisfied is
    likely to be of net benefit to Canada. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed earlier, the AGC has invoked s. 36(5) and is therefore not required
    to disclose <em>any</em> information referred to in s. 36(4)(b). I agree with the <em>CCAA</em> judge that, as a result of invoking s. 36(5), the AGC cannot be
    required to disclose the Settlement Agreement. This conclusion is supported on
    two bases. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    I agree with the <em>CCAA</em> judge that, in this case, “written undertaking”
    in s. 36(4)(b) means the Settlement Agreement. The information “referred to” in
    s. 36(4)(b) is therefore the information contained in the Settlement Agreement
    and, as a result of invoking s. 36(5), the AGC cannot be required to disclose
    any of that information. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have outlined above, the <em>CCAA</em> judge held that the structure of s. 36
    required that “written undertaking” in s. 36(4)(b) be treated as a reference to
    a document containing one or more undertakings, rather than the promises
    themselves contained in the document. As he noted, “containing” is used in s.
    36(2) in reference to information in a written document. “Contained” is also
    used in s. 36(4)(b). Here, the document containing the undertakings is the
    Settlement Agreement. The <em>CCAA</em> judge accordingly equated “written
    undertaking” in s. 36(4)(b) to the Settlement Agreement. Therefore, in his
    view, the information “referred to” in s. 36(4)(b) is all the information
    contained in the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents do not appear to challenge that conclusion, at least on the facts
    of this case. In her April 17, 2015 letter to the parties invoking s. 36(5),
    Jennifer Aitken, Director General of the Investment Review Division of Industry
    Canada, took the position that “disclosure of any information relating to written
    undertakings may not be required” where, in the opinion of the Minister’s
    designate, the communication or disclosure of that information is not necessary
    for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of the <em>ICA</em> and it would prejudicially affect the non-Canadian that gave the written
    undertaking in the conduct of its business affairs. She advised that the
    Director of Investments, appointed by the Minister pursuant to s. 6 of the <em>ICA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> had reviewed the Settlement Agreement
    and other documents and come to the conclusion that disclosure of the <span
class=Underline>Settlement Agreement</span> “is not necessary for any purpose
    relating to the administration or enforcement of the <em>ICA</em> and that the disclosure
    of it to persons other than the Monitor and the Monitor’s legal counsel in the <em>CCAA</em> proceedings would prejudicially affect the conduct of the business affairs of
    USS.” The Minister has apparently concluded that the Settlement Agreement
    consists of “information relating to written undertakings”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the <em>CCAA</em> judge that “written undertaking” in s.
    36(4)(b) defines the location of the information. And I agree that where, as is
    apparently the case here, the document consists of the undertakings given to
    the Minister and information relating to those undertakings, the document
    itself constitutes the “written undertaking” for the purpose of s. 36(4)(b). I
    also suspect that in most cases information contained in the document would
    consist of undertakings given to the Minister and information related to those
    undertakings. I need not determine whether “written undertaking” in s. 36(4)(b)
    also includes a document that contains undertakings given to the Minister,
    information related to those undertakings and information unrelated to those
    undertakings, or whether, in such a case, “written undertaking” in s. 36(4)(b)
    means only those parts of the document containing the undertakings and
    information related to those undertakings.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    under s. 36(2), the Minister cannot be required “to produce any statement or
    other writing containing [information described in s. 36(1)]”. There is no doubt
    that the Settlement Agreement contains information described in s. 36(1). Section
    36(4)(b) provides an exception with respect to “information contained in any
    written undertaking given to…”.  By invoking s. 36(5), the exception in s.
    36(4)(b) is of no effect with respect to the Minister. Therefore, s. 36(2)
    applies and the Minister cannot be required to produce the Settlement Agreement,
    which is a “writing containing [information described in s. 36(1)]”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining question is whether, because the AGC has invoked s. 36(5), USSC and USS
    cannot be required to disclose any information contained in the Settlement
    Agreement. <span style='color:black'>On appeal, the appellants argue that the
    answer to this question is no. They say that USSC and USS can be required to
    disclose information contained in the Settlement Agreement under s. 36(4)(b),
    even though the AGC has invoked s. 36(5), because s. 36(5) only protects the
    Minister or other government employees or officers from being forced to
    disclose information. They would therefore restrict the application of s. 36(5)
    to the parties named therein. The appellants did not make this argument before
    the </span><em>CCAA</em><span style='color:black'> judge. Because this appeal deals
    with the proper interpretation of the </span><em>ICA</em><span
style='color:black'>, and s. 36 specifically, I am persuaded that this court
    should address this question.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the exception to the exception in s. 36(4)(b), created by s. 36(5),
    does not apply to USSC and USS. Therefore, if not protected by common law
    settlement privilege, and absent a sealing order, USSC and USS can be required
    to disclose information contained in the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is clear from the wording of s. 36(5), which provides that “[n]o
    minister of the Crown and no officer or employee of Her Majesty in right of
    Canada or a province may be required …”. In contrast, s. 36(1) provides that
    “no one shall knowingly communicate …”.  If Parliament had intended to extend
    the “exception to the exception” in s. 36(5) to a broader category of persons
    than those listed, it could have used broad language, similar to that employed
    in s. 36(1). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject USS’s argument that <em>Camco Inc., Re.</em> (1983), 22 B.L.R. 1 (Ont.
    H.C.) supports its position that s. 36(5) also excepts the supplier of the
    information. In the course of a disputed application for the liquidation and
    dissolution of Camco under corporate legislation, disclosure was sought from
    Canadian General Electric (“CGE”) of documents it had filed in support of its
    earlier application to the Foreign Investment Review Agency (the “Agency”) to
    acquire Camco. Callaghan J. held that the supplier of the information, and not
    just the Minister, was entitled to the benefit of the statutory privilege
    created by s. 14(1) of <em>FIRA</em>. As discussed above, s. 14(1) provided
    that: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A]ll information with respect to a … business obtained by the
    Minister … is privileged and <span class=Underline>no person</span> shall
    knowingly … communicate or allow to be communicated to any person not legally
    entitled thereto any such information. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    CGE was not required to disclose the documents it had filed with the Agency. At
    issue in <em>Camco</em> was the scope of the term “no person”. The court in <em>Camco</em> did not hold that the words “no minister of the Crown and no officer or
    employee of Her Majesty” include the person who supplied the information. Instead,
    it held that the language of s. 14(1) and specifically the term “no person” –
    which is much broader than the wording in s. 36(5) of the <em>ICA</em> and its equivalent
    under <em>FIRA</em> in s. 14(4) – clearly applied to the supplier of the
    information. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also reject USS’s argument that restricting s. 36(5) to the persons
    specifically named therein renders the section meaningless. Doing so provides
    an “exception to the exception” for the persons named therein. It also ensures
    that the information cannot be obtained from the Minister under the <em>ATIA</em>.
    As the appellants have argued, it was (and is still) open to USS to seek a
    sealing order to protect the confidentiality of the Settlement Agreement in the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding in accordance with the test in <em>Sierra Club of
    Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance)</em>, 2002 SCC 41, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522, as
    was done in <i>Canada <em>(Attorney General) v. United States Steel Corp.</em></i> Such orders have been granted in <em>CCAA</em> proceedings to protect
    privileged materials:<em> Hollinger Inc. (Re)</em>, 2011 ONCA 579, 107 O.R.
    (3d) 1, at paras. 19-23, leave to appeal refused, [2011] S.C.C.A. No. 473.  </p>

    Agreement. USSC specifically asserted that the confidentiality of the
    Settlement Agreement was protected both by the terms of the agreement and s. 36
    of the <em>ICA</em>. I make no determination as to whether USSC waived its
    common law settlement privilege by referring to the Settlement Agreement in the
    affidavit.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span

    Agreement is privileged under the <em>ICA</em>, should this court determine
    whether disclosure of all or part of the Settlement Agreement is barred by
    common law settlement privilege?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court highlighted the importance of settlement privilege in <em>Sable
    Offshore Energy Inc. v. Ameron International Corp.</em><i>, </i>2013 SCC 37,
    [2013] 2 S.C.R. 623. As Abella J., writing for the court, states at para. 12,
    “[s]ettlement privilege promotes settlements”. Promoting settlement contributes
    to the effective administration of justice. While the settlement privilege
    creates a presumption of inadmissibility with respect to settlement
    negotiations, exceptions to the privilege will be found “when the justice of
    the case requires it”. The party seeking to override the settlement privilege
    must show that there is a competing public interest that outweighs the public
    interest in securing settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that, if s. 36 of the <em>ICA</em> does not prohibit
    disclosure of the Settlement Agreement or the undertakings contained therein, this
    court should determine whether disclosure is barred by the common law
    settlement privilege, rather than sending the matter back to the <em>CCAA</em> judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that they have demonstrated a competing public interest in
    favour of disclosure that outweighs the public interest in encouraging settlement.
    They say that if USS has obligations to USSC under the Settlement Agreement,
    USS’s very significant claim in the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding could be subject
    to set-off. They also emphasize that they represent employees and retirees
    affected by the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding. They say they are entitled to know
    whether or not USS has obligations to USSC under the Settlement Agreement, how
    those obligations impact the current restructuring negotiations, and whether
    USS is in breach of any obligations to USSC. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:

    whether production of the Settlement Agreement and its contents is barred by
    common law settlement privilege to the <em>CCAA</em> judge for determination. However,
    they argue that, in any event, this question should be answered in the
    affirmative. They say that substantial disclosure of the undertakings was made
    in a press release at the time of the settlement in 2011 and, further, that the
    undertakings were made to the Minister and are not for the appellants to
    enforce. USSC notes that there is no evidence that production of further
    details of the Settlement Agreement will impact the <em>CCAA</em> claims
    process. Their position is reinforced, they submit, because the Monitor has a
    copy of the Settlement Agreement and has not argued that it should be disclosed
    to the appellants.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Neither
