font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>On August 6, 2004 the respondent, Can Hoang,
    drove his six-year old son, Christopher, one of the appellants, and three other
    children to downtown Toronto for a planned outing to Centre Island. Hoang let
    the children out of the car at the intersection of Yonge Street and Queen’s
    Quay Boulevard, across from the ferry terminal, before parking the car. As
    Christopher began to walk across Yonge Street, a few feet behind the other
    children, a gust of wind blew his hat off his head into the intersection.
    Christopher ran after his hat and into the intersection where he was struck by
    a vehicle driven by the respondent, Adriano Vicentini. Christopher suffered
    significant injuries.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Christopher brought an action against his
    father, Vicentini, and the respondent, Ford Credit Canada Leasing Company, the
    owner of the Vicentini vehicle. Christopher was joined in his action by his
    minor sister, Danielle Hoang, and his mother, San Trieu, both of whom asserted
    claims for loss of care, guidance and companionship pursuant to the provisions
    of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%'>Family

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Following a 38-day trial, the jury found that
    Hoang negligently caused the accident and his son’s injuries. The jury assessed
    Christopher’s damages at $150,000 for non-pecuniary damages and $684,228.22 for
    future care costs. Christopher’s mother, the appellant San Trieu, was awarded
    damages under the </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;

    partial indemnity costs to Vicentini fixed at $435,214.19 and to Ford Credit in
    the amount of $173,695.39. She also ordered Hoang to pay the plaintiffs their

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The plaintiffs appeal, asking this court to
    order a new trial on the issue of the liability of Vicentini and Ford Credit
    and increase the damages for future care costs to $1.1 million. The appellants
    also seek orders requiring The Personal Insurance Company (“The Personal”),

    describing the history of his dealings with the defence counsel The Personal
    appointed, as well as with his personal counsel. No objection was taken to the
    court considering this evidence; indeed, Vicentini included Hoang’s affidavit
    in his appeal book and compendium. Consequently, I would grant the motion to
    adduce fresh evidence, and I have taken into account the chronology of events
    described in the fresh evidence.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>The Rules of Civil Procedure have very specific provisions for
    the inclusion of expert testimony at trials and the 2010 amendments to the
    provisions governing expert reports provide for more stringent requirements
    before an expert is permitted to testify. No report from Mr. Grisolia that
    complies with Rule 53.03 has been tendered and there is no evidence before me
    of any attempts made by the solicitor for the Plaintiffs to secure an opinion
    from Mr. Grisolia on the brakes on the Viscentini car in a form of a report
    that complies with Rule 53.  There is nothing in the document that he completed
    in 2004 that sets out his opinion. What he has done is to examine the various
    items listed on the document and tick off the appropriate box to indicate
    whether the component met the Ministry standards or not.  I do not say this in
    a critical fashion; this is the document that Mr. Grisolia is required to fill
    out by the police when he inspects a vehicle that has been involved in a
    collision.  The document, however, is deficient in terms of providing the
    minimum information that is contemplated by Rule 53 for expert reports.  I have
    no information as to what qualifications Mr. Grisolia has, apart from the fact
    that he was employed by the police to do mechanical inspections of vehicles.  I
    do not know if he has the proper qualifications to even permit him to be
    qualified as an expert at trial. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, on the basis of the document he completed on his
    inspection of the vehicle, I am not prepared to permit him to give expert
    testimony at this trial. To do so, in my opinion, would contravene the
    requirements of Rule 53 and would flout the reasoning giving rise to the
    amendments to the Rules governing expert evidence.  The fact that the solicitor
    for the Plaintiff has provided a synopsis of his expected testimony does not,
    in my mind, get around the problems with Mr. Grisolia offering an expert
    opinion to this Court…  </p>

    brakes in proper working order. I would not accept this submission for two
    reasons. First, the pleading of particulars of negligence in motor vehicle
    accident cases tends to have a boiler-plate character. The more useful
    indicator of a plaintiff’s theory of liability usually is found in the expert
    reports. As described above, in the present case the appellants’ expert
    reviewed Grisolia’s vehicle Examination Form in preparing his report, but did
    not advance any opinion of liability based upon the unsatisfactory performance

    the view that seized calipers and unsatisfactory brake performance “would also
    cause greater brake pedal travel.” As well, Grisolia’s proposed opinion
    evidence stood opposed to his notation on the vehicle examination form that

    entitled to independent counsel at the insurer's expense. The question is
    whether counsel's mandate from the insurer can reasonably be said to conflict
    with his mandate to defend the insured in the civil action. Until that point is
    reached, the insured's right to a defence and the insurer's right to control

    do not agree with that submission. In the present case, both Hoang and
    Vicentini adopted a trial strategy in which they did not blame the other for
    the accident. Instead, they took the position that the accident was unavoidable
    because Christopher unexpectedly darted into the traffic to retrieve his hat.
    In appropriate circumstances, not blaming the other defendant can operate as a
    sound litigation strategy. It may assist in providing a united front on
    limiting damages, avoid alienating the jury, and reduce the likelihood of a </span><em><span
