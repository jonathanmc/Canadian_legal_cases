  <p class=Heard>Heard: February 9, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice James A.S. Wilcox
    of the Superior Court of Justice dated February 3, 2015, with reasons reported
    at 2014 ONSC 4290.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Simmons
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue on this family law appeal is whether any portion of the
    profits of a corporation now wholly owned by the husband as a result of the marriage
    breakdown should be added to his income for spousal support purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties married in 1992 and separated in 2011. They have two
    children. During their marriage, the parties worked together to build a highly
    successful recreational equipment business in northeastern Ontario.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first day of trial, the parties signed Minutes of Settlement
    resolving all issues between them except spousal support. Among other things,
    the Minutes of Settlement provided that the husband would buy out the wife’s
    interest in the business and pay to her an equalization payment of $1,636,130,
    with $1 million payable up front and the balance over five years with interest
    at four per cent per year. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the separation, the wife continued to work in the business, at
    least part time, until January 2013. Under the terms of two consent interim
    orders, the parties agreed that each would continue to receive an annual salary
    of $120,000, even after the wife stopped working in the business, until the
    issue of spousal support was determined.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the fiscal year that ended prior to trial, the business sustained an
    after-tax loss of $235,067. However, during the preceding eight-year period,
    the business had generated after-tax profits, over and above the parties’
    salaries and bonuses, averaging almost $355,000 per year. During this period, on
    average, the parties had drawn salaries and bonuses totaling in aggregate $204,372
    per calendar year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge accepted the wife’s
    position that the husband’s income for spousal support purposes should comprise
    both salary and some component of after-tax corporate profits. Apparently based
    on the incomes the parties had been receiving in the period leading up to the
    trial and the business’s historical after-tax earnings, the trial judge concluded
    that, going forward, the husband would have salary and after-tax corporate profits
    available to him for spousal support purposes totaling $400,000 per year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the wife, the trial judge accepted her position that she could
    earn $35,000 to $40,000 per year as a bookkeeper and that she would also earn $40,000
    to $50,000 per year in investment income on $1,000,000, for a total annual
    income of $75,000 to $90,000. The trial judge relied on $82,500 as her “midpoint”
    income for spousal support calculation purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using income figures of $400,000 and $82,500, the trial judge found that
    the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a> (“SSAGs”) produce a range for spousal support of $8,215 to $10,233 per month.
    Holding that there was no reason to depart from the mid-range, the trial judge
    ordered the husband to pay to the wife $9,584 per month in spousal support,
    commencing August 1, 2014. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument on appeal, the wife acknowledged that, based on the
    trial judge’s income figures, the applicable SSAGs range is less than that
    cited by the trial judge. The wife also acknowledged that the trial judge
    failed to take into account the income she is receiving from the balance owing
    on the equalization payment or consider that she would be able to invest that balance
    as it is received.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the issues relating to the SSAGs range and determination of the
    wife’s income, the husband submitted that the trial judge erred in the
    following ways:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1.    by
    focusing his analysis on the provisions of the <em>Divorce Act</em> R.S.C.
    1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.),<em> </em>rather than the provisions of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>, R.S.O 1990, c. F.3, the Act under which the wife advanced her
    claim;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2.    by failing
    to consider s. 2(10) of the <em>Family Law Act</em> and the doctrine of issue
    estoppel, given that both the Minutes of Settlement and the Final Order into
    which it was incorporated stipulated the amount of child support payable by the
    husband to the wife and therefore effectively determined the amount of the
    husband’s income;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3.    by
    attributing income, including corporate profits, to the husband without an
    adequate basis or explanation and by failing to apply the Ontario <em>Child
    Support Guidelines</em>, O. Reg. 391/97 (“CSGs”), enacted under the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, to the determination of the husband’s income as required by the
    SSAGs; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>4.    by
    failing to properly consider the impact of the property settlement on the
    spousal support issue; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>5.    by
    holding that the wife is entitled to spousal support.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband also applied to introduce fresh evidence on appeal addressing how the
    equalization payment is being paid and the income tax consequences of the
    property settlement and support award. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the fresh evidence application but
    allow the appeal. Although I would not accept all the husband’s arguments, I
    conclude that the trial judge erred in determining both the husband’s income and
    the wife’s income. Rather than ordering a new trial, I propose to determine
    these issues and the quantum of spousal support that is properly payable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    turning to the issues, I will briefly set out some background facts relating to
    the parties, the business, the business’s income, the parties’ incomes and the
    provisions of the Minutes of Settlement and child support orders on which the
    husband relies. I will also set out relevant provisions of the SSAGs and CSGs.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the trial judge, the parties began cohabiting in either 1989 or 1991. They
    married on April 23, 1992 and separated on November 6, 2011. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties have two children, born in 1993 and 1995. At the time of trial in March
    2014, the older child was in the third year of a four-year university program
    and lived away from home during the school year; the younger child was in the
    first year of a three-year college program and lived at home with the wife. In
    addition to the child support to which the parties had agreed, both children
    had money available to them for educational expenses through RESPs, bank
    accounts and a family trust.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wife completed grade twelve and two years of a business administration course
    at college. Prior to working in the business she had experience in clerking,
    bookkeeping and retail. When the parties met, she was earning about $20,000 per
    year working for a restaurant supplier.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the relationship began, the husband was a miner earning about $80,000 per year.
    He also had a hobby of purchasing, fixing up and reselling used snowmobiles.</p>
  <h2><span style='line-height:200%'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>     The business</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that, in 1989, the parties purchased a small engine and boat repair
    shop located in Timmins for $5,000. According to the trial judge, by 1995, both
    had quit their previous jobs to work full-time in their growing business –
    which eventually expanded to include sales of recreational vehicles, equipment,
    clothing and accessories. As the trial judge expressed it, the husband was the
    entrepreneur while the wife handled financial management and administration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Originally,
    the business was operated as a sole proprietorship. In 1995, the parties
    incorporated it. In 2010, they reorganized the business so that it comprised an
    operating company, Mikey’s General Sales and Repair Ltd. (“Mikeys”),<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></span></a> and a holding company, M&amp;L Holdings Inc., which owns the buildings from
    which Mikeys operates. The husband owned 70% of the common shares of the corporations,
    while the wife owned 30%.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her evidence at trial, the wife testified about the evolution of the business.
    She explained that, in 1996, in addition to their original Timmins location,
    the parties purchased another Timmins business, which carried the Bombardier
    and Honda lines of recreational vehicles. In 1998, they built a new building at
    their original location and consolidated the two businesses. Around the same
    time, they opened locations in North Bay and Cochrane. However, in 2000, they
    closed both of those locations and struggled for a year or two while they
    liquidated the inventory. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    2003, the consolidated Timmins business had taken off. Over time, it expanded
    into new lines of equipment, including boat and hot tub sales. In 2007, they
    built a large new showroom. Around the same time, the wife hired an assistant
    for the office and the husband began to pass off some of his responsibilities
    to a sales manager, a service manager and a parts manager. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the wife, beginning in late 2008, the parties were able to build a new home
    at a cost of about $800,000 without incurring any debt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the parties’ separation in November 2011, the wife continued to work full-time
    in the business until August 2012, when she began working part-time. The wife
    stopped working in the business in January 2013.</p>

    note that, in practice, there is much overlap between federal and
    provincial/territorial support laws. Section 5.1 states that, since the release
    of the Draft Proposal, the Advisory Guidelines have frequently been used in
    spousal support determinations under provincial legislation. The SSAGs have not

    purposes – and one “that reflects and clarifies much of the pre-<em><span

    couples their age, incomes and obligations, and that their property is divided
    equally under matrimonial property laws. Significant departures from these
    assumptions may affect where support is fixed within the ranges for amount and

  <p class=LegislativeQuote>17. (1) If the court is of the opinion that the

    reasonable in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income or receipt
    of a non-recurring amount during those years.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) Where a … spouse has incurred a non-recurring
    capital or business investment loss, the court may, if it is of the opinion

    provisions of the <em>Divorce Act</em> rather than on the provisions of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>? </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge noted that the wife claimed spousal support under
    the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act </span></em>and that,
    although she had not claimed a divorce, the husband had. However, despite the
    fact that no divorce was being granted, the trial judge focused his analysis on
    the provisions of the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Divorce Act </span></em>and
    did not refer to any <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act</span></em> provisions. He explained that, in part, this was a matter of expediency, as most
    of the cases that had been cited to him did the same. Both parties had referred
    to both Acts – and the husband had argued that the same parameters should apply
    under both Acts. Further, he was satisfied that, whichever Act applies, policy
    reasons support ensuring that the same principles and factors govern support
    awards. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the husband submits that the trial judge erred by focusing his analysis
    on <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Divorce Act</span></em> principles rather
    than <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act</span></em> principles. In
    particular, he points to s. 33(9)(b) of the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Family
    Law Act</span></em>, which specifies that in determining the amount and
    duration of any support award the court shall consider all the circumstances of
    the parties, including “the assets and means that the dependant and respondent
    are likely to have in the future.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband claims that no similar requirement exists in the <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Divorce Act</span></em>. Further, he says that, in
    this case, this omission is particularly important because of the debt load he
    assumed to pay the equalization payment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not accept this argument. Not only was it not advanced in the court below,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly however, I am satisfied that, like the <em>Family Law Act</em>, the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Divorce Act</span></em> also requires a
    court to consider the assets and means the parties are likely to have in the
    future when making a support award. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a starting point, the Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that “means” is
    to be given an expansive interpretation such that it includes “all pecuniary
    resources, capital assets, income from employment or earning capacity, and
    other sources from which the person receives gains or benefits”: <em><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    s. 15.2(4) of the <em>Divorce Act</em><i> </i>must be interpreted in accordance
    with the modern rule of statutory interpretation, which requires that the words
    of an Act “be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and
    ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act,
    and the intention of Parliament”:<span class=Heading1Char><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span

    assets and means the parties are likely to have in the future. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    17(4.1) of the <em>Divorce Act</em><i> </i>provides that:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Before the court makes a variation order in respect
    of a spousal support order, the court shall satisfy itself that a change in the
    condition, means, needs or other circumstances of either former spouse has
    occurred since the making of the spousal support order….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    17(4.1) has been interpreted as requiring a “material” change in circumstances,
    meaning a change, “such that, if known at the time, would likely have resulted
    in different terms”: see <em><span style='line-height:200%'>L.M.P. v. L.S.</span></em>,
    2011 SCC 64, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 775, at para. 44, quoting <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Willick v. Willick</span></em>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670,
    at p. 688. As Sopinka J. observed in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Willick</span></em>,
    at p. 688, “[t]he corollary to this is that if the matter which is relied on as
    constituting a change was known at the relevant time, it cannot be relied on as
    the basis for variation.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of s. 17(4.1), a change requiring a variation of a spousal support
    order must therefore be a change in the condition, means or other circumstances
    of a party that is of an unforeseen nature: see e.g. <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Zacharias v. Zacharias</span></em>, 2015 BCCA 376, 389
    D.L.R. (4th) 310, at para. 29. This interpretation makes it clear that the
    phrase “the condition, means … and other circumstances of each spouse” as it
    appears in s. 15.2(4) requires consideration of the assets and means the
    parties are likely to have in the future. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following statement in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Fisher v. Fisher</span></em>,
    2008 ONCA 11, 88 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 96, which involved a claim for spousal
    support under the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Divorce Act</span></em>,
    also supports this interpretation: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Importantly, <span class=Underline>in all cases</span>, the
    reasonableness of an award produced by the [SSAGs] must be balanced in light of
    the circumstances of the individual case, including the particular financial

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I am not satisfied that the husband has identified any material difference
    between the two Acts or any error in the trial judge’s reasons that arises from
    the trial judge’s focus on the provisions of the <em><span style='line-height:
200%'>Divorce Act</span></em>.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>          Did the trial judge err by failing to consider s. 2(10) of the <em>Family Law Act</em> and the doctrine of issue estoppel?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;As
    noted above, the Minutes of Settlement provided that the existing interim order
    for child support would be confirmed in a final order. The interim order for
    child support was premised on a finding that the husband had an annual income
    of $136,500. As the Minutes of Settlement constituted a domestic contract – and
    were incorporated into a final order before the trial judge delivered his
    reasons – the husband submits that both s. 2(10) of the <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act</span></em> and the doctrine of issue estoppel
    compel the conclusion that his income for spousal support purposes was
    $136,500.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not accept these arguments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2(10) of the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act </span></em>states:
    “[a] domestic contract dealing with a matter that is also dealt with in this
    Act prevails unless this Act provides otherwise.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the Minutes of Settlement are a domestic contract as defined in the <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act</span></em>. However, I do not agree
    that the Minutes of Settlement determine the husband’s income for spousal
    support purposes. I say that for three reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Minutes of Settlement do not “deal with” the husband’s income for spousal
    support purposes. Although they recite that the parties had agreed that a final
    order would be entered to confirm the interim order for child support, they do
    not include a provision specifying the husband’s income. Rather, the Minutes of
    Settlement stipulate that the parties had not settled the issue of spousal
    support and state that “nothing contained herein shall be construed as a bar or
    limitation to the [wife’s] claim for compensatory and/or non-compensatory
    spousal support”. In the face of these terms, and in the absence of a provision
    in the Minutes of Settlement explicitly addressing the husband’s income, I fail
    to see how the Minutes of Settlement can be interpreted as “dealing with” the
    husband’s income within the meaning of s. 2(10) of the <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the parties’ agreement regarding the amount of child support in this case is
    not necessarily a reliable indicator of the husband’s income for spousal
    support purposes. Again, as mentioned, the Minutes of Settlement and the
    subsequent order did not specify the husband’s income. In addition, at the time
    of trial, both children were attending post-secondary educational institutions
    (one lived with her mother while the other was away during the school year) and
    the parties had made some other arrangements for their post-secondary
    educational expenses through RESPs, bank accounts, and a family trust. In these
    circumstances, it was open to the parties to agree on an amount of child
    support that did not reflect the husband’s income. It was also open to the
    court to order child support in accordance with the parties’ agreement: s.
    33(14) of the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Act</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the argument raised on appeal was not raised at trial. Had either of the
    parties intended that the Minutes of Settlement would constitute a binding
    determination of the husband’s income, counsel would undoubtedly have raised
    that issue at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no merit in the husband’s argument that the Final Order premised on the
    Minutes of Settlement creates an issue estoppel in relation to the husband’s
    income for the purposes of spousal support. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    three requirements for issue estoppel are well-established: (i) the same
    question has been decided in earlier proceedings; (ii) the earlier judicial
    decision was final; and (iii) the parties to that decision or their privies are
    the same in both the proceedings. If the moving party successfully establishes
    these preconditions, a court must still determine whether, as a matter of
    discretion, issue estoppel ought to be applied: <em><span style='line-height:
200%'>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc.</span></em>, 2001 SCC 44, [2001] 2

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span

    with the first requirement, like the Minutes of Settlement, the April 23, 2014

    explained in relation to the Minutes of Settlement, I am not satisfied that the
    child support order constitutes an adjudication on the issue of the husband’s
    income for spousal support purposes.</p>

    to the second requirement, even assuming a final adjudication of child support
    could amount to an estoppel in relation to spousal support, on its face, the

    Rather, it states, “the child support order dated October 17, 2013 … shall
    continue until the Interim Order for child support is confirmed as a Final
    Order”. As it is not a final order for child support, the April 23, 2014 order

    judge’s reasons</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
    in his reasons, the trial judge summarized the wife’s position concerning the
    quantum of the husband’s income for spousal support purposes:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>salary from the business- $200,000 per year,</p>

  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>undeclared cash income - $50,000-$100,000 per year (subject to
    gross up), and</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>imputed income for the value of business perks, including payment
    of personal expenses and use of recreational equipment - $86,706 per year.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          Total – as much as $741,706 per year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not accept the wife’s assertion that the husband’s income
    should include undeclared cash or business perks. In his view, including
    undeclared cash as income - which the husband claimed had only ever consisted
    of small amounts and, in any event, had stopped - would force the husband to
    engage in an unethical business practice. And while the trial judge recognized
    that, prior to separation, the business paid for personal expenses such as
    food, fuel and home maintenance, he expressed the same view concerning such
    expenses. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the use of demonstration recreational vehicles, the trial judge held such
    use was largely for promotional purposes and not properly included in income
    for spousal support purposes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge addressed the husband’s salary and the corporate after–tax business
    profits as one category. His reasons are brief and do not explain how he
    arrived at $400,000 as the total salary plus after-tax corporate profits the
    husband would have available to him, or the breakdown between the two
    categories of income. However, he referred to the following matters:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span

  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in making her submissions, the wife relied on averages for the
    eight-year period prior to her leaving the business in 2013, after which gross
    revenues dropped and there was a net loss for the first time since 2000; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>taking a ten-year average would produce lower average numbers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge observed that there had been anecdotal evidence at trial about the
    effects on the business of increased competition, the local economy, the wife
    leaving the business and the husband being distracted by the litigation.
    However, he said “predicting the future of the business is an exercise in
    guesswork”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the suggestion that he should consider that the business
    would be in a weaker position as a result of having to fund the equalization.
    In his view, doing so would be akin to making the wife “pay for the assets that
    she received in the property division.” Nonetheless, he acknowledged that “keeping
    the business financially healthy and viable” was in the wife’s interests. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also acknowledged that allowance had to be made for replacing the
    wife’s function in the business – and that it would take more than one
    bookkeeper, earning $30,000-$40,000 per year, to replace a dedicated part owner
    like the wife. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded this portion of his reasons by saying “although the
    numbers are soft, I would put the annual total of the [husband’s] income and
    the business’ profits at $400,000 per year going forward for spousal support
    purposes.”</p>
  <h5 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The husband’s position on appeal</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the husband argues that the trial judge failed to apply the
    correct legal principles in determining his income and failed to provide
    sufficient reasons for the determination he made. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the husband, courts routinely apply the Guidelines to determine income for
    spousal support purposes, even where the parties have no dependent children.
    Moreover, the SSAGs recommend use of the Guidelines to determine income. The
    husband submits that the trial judge erred in failing to apply the Guidelines in
    determining his income for spousal support purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband points out that, under s. 16 of the Guidelines, his income for support
    purposes is his line 150 income. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband acknowledges that, where the court is of the opinion that a spouse’s
    line 150 income does not fairly reflect all the money available for the payment
    of child support, s. 18 of the Guidelines permits a court to add to a payor’s
    line 150 income all or part of the pre-tax corporate income of a company of
    which the payor is an officer, director or shareholder. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While case law
    concerning the interpretation of s. 18 of the Guidelines is unsettled, the
    husband submits that corporate income can only be added where the corporation
    had pre-tax income (as opposed to a loss) in the most recent taxation year: <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Bear v. Thompson</span></em>, 2014 SKCA 111, 378
    D.L.R. (4th) 649. That is not the case here, as Mikeys suffered a loss for the
    fiscal year ended April 30, 2013, the year preceding the trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
    husband submits that the trial judge erred in adding any portion of the salary
    the wife formerly received from Mikeys to his line 150 income or any other
    averaged calculation of corporate profits. However, he accepts that it would be
    appropriate to fix his income for spousal support purposes at $136,500, the
    figure underlying the child support figure in the Minutes of Settlement and
    Final Order.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the
    husband submits that at most, the case law supports including in a payor’s
    income some portion of average pre-tax corporate profits over the preceding
    three years in keeping with s. 17(1) of the Guidelines: <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>O’Neill v. O’Neill</span></em> (2007), 39 R.F.L. (6th)
    72 (Ont. S.C.).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the
    husband, several factors militate against attributing any portion of the
    average of Mikeys’ pre-tax corporate income between 2011 and 2013 to his line
    150 income. These factors include Mikeys’ historical pattern of retaining
    earnings, its debt level, the fact that the husband’s salary is reasonable and
    the fact that the business requires rebuilding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, at
    worst, the husband claims that, under s. 17(1) of the Guidelines, his income
    for spousal support purposes should have been his line 150 income plus Mikeys’
    average pre-tax corporate income for the three years prior to trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband says
    Mikeys’ average pre-tax corporate income for the three years prior to trial was
    $112,157.33.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]</span></span></span></span></a> Accordingly, even if that entire amount were added to his income (an outcome he
    disputes), at most, his income for spousal support purposes should have been
    fixed at $232,157.33, being $120,000 in salary plus $112,157.33 in average pre-tax
    corporate profits for the three-year period preceding the trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the
    trial judge arrived at a total income for spousal support purposes for the
    husband of $400,000. The trial judge did not explain how he arrived at that
    figure. However, it is apparent that he considered after-tax corporate profits
    over at least an eight-year timeframe. The husband submits that no authority
    supports this approach. Moreover, the trial judge provided no rationale for
    adopting it.</p>
  <h5>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The wife’s
    position </h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The wife
    relies on the following facts: that the parties had been drawing $240,000 per
    year in aggregate salary from Mikeys in the years leading up to the buy-out of
    the business; that the cost of a replacement bookkeeper would be about $40,000;
    and that Mikeys averaged $355,000 in annual after-tax corporate profits in the
    eight-year period after it limited its operations to its consolidated facility in
    Timmins and before the wife left the business. Even if the 2013 loss is
    accounted for, that reduces average annual after-tax corporate profits from
    2005 onward to about $289,000. The wife does not suggest that 100% of Mikeys’
    average annual after-tax corporate income should be added to the husband’s
    income. However, she points out that at the time of the buy-out, Mikeys had
    term deposits totaling $568,000, was completely debt-free and was not using its
    $700,000 line of credit. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account
    of all these factors, and the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties during the
    marriage, the wife submits that the trial judge’s conclusion that the husband
    would have available to him a combined total of $400,000 in annual salary and after-tax
    corporate profits for purposes of paying spousal support is fully justified. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
    issue of applying the Guidelines to determine income for spousal support
    purposes was never raised at trial. </p>
  <h5>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     Standard of review</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of the
    fact-based and discretionary nature of support awards, a trial judge’s order
    for spousal support is entitled to significant deference on appeal.<span
class=Heading1Char><span style='line-height:200%'> </span></span>This deferential
    approach to support awards promotes finality in family law litigation and also recognizes
    the importance of the trial judge’s role in seeing and hearing the parties and
    other witnesses testify. An appeal court is not entitled to overturn a spousal support
    order simply because it would have balanced the relevant factors differently or
    arrived at a different decision: <em>Hickey v. Hickey</em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R.
    518, at paras. 10-12.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, an
    appeal court must intervene where the trial judge’s reasons disclose an error
    in principle, a significant misapprehension of the evidence or if the award is

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons I
    will explain, I conclude that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the
    trial judge erred when determining the husband’s income.  Despite using the
    SSAGs to determine the <em>range</em> for support, he arrived at an income
    figure without either applying the Guidelines or explaining why they are inapplicable
    and by adopting an unreasonable approach to determining income. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I
    would set aside the trial judge’s determination of the husband’s income.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to
    the expense involved in ordering a new trial, I consider it in the interests of

    approach to determining income </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge that
    the SSAGs are advisory in nature, not mandatory. The trial judge was therefore
    not required to apply the SSAGs to determine the quantum of spousal support –
    it was open to him to use a different methodology. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    wife’s position at trial was that the trial judge should apply the SSAGs to
    determine the amount of support the husband should pay. She did not ask that
    spousal support be determined on a budget-based approach; nor did she advance
    an alternative theory for determining her claim to compensatory support.
    Rather, the wife asked the trial judge to rely on the SSAGs’ ranges to
    determine the quantum of spousal support.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    accepted the wife’s position. He relied solely on the SSAGs ranges to determine
    the quantum of spousal support.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 6.1 of
    the SSAGs provides that the starting point for determining income is the
    definition of income under the Guidelines.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[11]</span></span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial
    judge was using the SSAGs to determine the amount of spousal support, it was
    incumbent on him to <em>either</em> rely on the Guideline provisions for
    determining income – <em>or</em> to explain why they should not apply. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this regard,
    I note that the SSAGs are income-based guidelines that require careful
    attention to the actual incomes, or the income earning capacities, of both
    spouses.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

    the amount of spousal support that is payable solely by applying the SSAGs
    ranges without considering the SSAGs provisions for determining income. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Fisher v.
    Fisher</em>, a case decided in January 2008, this court examined how the SSAGs
    were then being used across the country. While commenting at para. 97 that, at
    least as of that time, “the Guidelines cannot be used as a software tool or a
    formula that calculates a specific amount of support for a set period of time”,
    the court also cautioned that “[t]hey must be considered in context <u>and
    applied in their entirety</u> (emphasis added)”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, in <em>The
    Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines: A New and Improved User’s Guide to the
    Final Version</em>,<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[13]</span></span></span></span></a> the authors note, at p. 1 of the Introduction, that one of the challenges of
    the SSAGs “is the problem of unsophisticated use.” The authors continue by stating:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For too many, using the Guidelines means just plugging the
    income figures into the software program, getting the range and choosing the
    mid-point. There is more to the advisory guidelines than this, and using them
    in this way can lead to inappropriate results.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the
    trial judge in this case relied solely on the SSAGs to determine the amount of
    spousal support, I conclude that he erred in failing to either apply the Guidelines
    provisions for determining income or to explain why they are inapplicable. In fairness
    to the trial judge, trial counsel did not bring s. 6 of the SSAGs to his
    attention or direct him to ss. 15-18 of the Guidelines.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge’s failure to either apply the Guidelines or explain why they are not
    applicable is exacerbated by the paucity of his reasons. He did not explain how
    he arrived at $400,000 as the combined salary and after-tax corporate profits
    that the husband would have available to him going forward for spousal support
    purposes. In particular, and among other things, he did not explain: what
    amount, if any, he attributed to the husband from the wife’s former salary;
    over what period of years (if any) he averaged past corporate profits; why he
    chose that number of years; whether, and why he included, or did not include,
    in any averaging, the loss Mikeys sustained in 2013; and what percentage of
    anticipated corporate profits he included in the husband’s income and why he
    chose that percentage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said,
    viewed in the context of the parties’ submissions, it appears likely that the
    trial judge adopted one of several scenarios advanced by the wife’s counsel
    during closing submissions at trial. If this assumption is inaccurate, the
    trial judge’s reasons were wholly inadequate. See<span class=Heading1Char><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span></span><em><span style='line-height:200%'>R.
    v. Sheppard</span></em>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In one of the scenarios
    advanced on behalf of the wife, counsel submitted that it would be reasonable
    to assume that the husband would have available to him $200,000 in management
    salaries previously paid (being the parties’ $120,000 salaries added together less
    $40,000 as the cost of bookkeeper(s) to replace the wife) plus $200,000 of the
    approximately $300,000 to $355,000 in average annual after-tax corporate
    profits the company had generated in the last eight to nine years, depending on
    whether 2013 was included in the average – for a total of $400,000 in available
    income. Counsel pointed to the husband’s lifestyle in the preceding year, in
    which the husband took numerous vacations, as supporting this level of income. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the trial
    judge did not adopt this scenario to reach the $400,000 figure, then his conclusion
    on income lacks any meaningful explanation or rational basis. As noted by this
    court in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Drygala v. Pauli</span></em> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 711 (C.A.), at para. 44, when considering the proper basis
    for imputing income under s. 19 of the Guidelines, there must be “a rational
    basis” underlying the figure selected and the exercise of the court’s
    discretion must be “grounded in the evidence.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the trial
    judge did adopt this scenario then, in my view, the trial judge’s conclusion
    that the husband would have $400,000 available to him for spousal support
    purposes going forward is unreasonable and clearly wrong. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a starting
    point, the wife called no evidence at trial to support her submission that a
    reasonable basis for estimating Mikeys’ future corporate profits would be to
    average after-tax corporate profits over the preceding eight- or nine-year
    period. Nor did the wife’s counsel submit any authority, either at trial or on
    appeal that would support this approach to estimating future corporate income.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, as I
    will explain more fully in a later section, the Guidelines adopt a
    substantially different approach to addressing corporate income and calculating
    personal income than that advocated by the wife and apparently adopted by the
    trial judge – and, as I will explain, they produce a much lower income for the
    husband, and one which appears more realistic in the face of Mikeys’ recent
    performance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, rather
    than long-term averaging, the Guidelines permit an examination, in certain
    circumstances, of any pattern of income or fluctuation in income over the last
    three years to allow the court to determine an income that is fair and
    reasonable: s. 17 of the Guidelines. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, rather
    than after-tax corporate income, the Guidelines focus on pre-tax corporate
    income in assessing whether any portion of corporate profits should be added to
    a payor’s income: s. 18 of the Guidelines. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several case
    specific factors demonstrate that the trial judge’s unexplained departure from
    the Guidelines in determining income was unreasonable and clearly wrong in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Mikeys’ gross
    revenues and income had both peaked in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2008 and
    had been on a downward trend since then. In these circumstances, using a simple
    long-term average to determine future corporate income gave equal weight to all
    years and failed, without explanation, to recognize the downward trend in both
    sales and income that had been occurring since 2008.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using the wife’s
    after-tax corporate income figures (which are net of the parties’ salaries),
    Mikeys had not generated net after-tax corporate income in the range of the
    $300,000 to $355,000 average on which she relied since the fiscal year ended
    April 30, 2010. Rather, net after-tax income was $291,549 for fiscal 2011 and
    $226,990 for fiscal 2012. Mikeys sustained a loss in the fiscal year ended
    April 30, 2013, the most recent taxation year prior to trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Mikeys’
    accountant, the 2013 loss was attributable to several factors, including local
    economic conditions, which resulted in decreased gross revenues, and increased costs.
    The accountant also acknowledged that the husband may have been distracted
    because of the litigation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from
    commenting that there was anecdotal evidence concerning the local economy, the
    impact of the litigation and the wife’s departure from the business, the trial
    judge did not review this evidence. Significantly, he made no findings that
    either the downward trend or the loss was manipulated or artificial and did not
    explain how Mikeys could return, in the near future, to pre-2011 levels of
    profit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned
    above, the Guidelines rely on the more recent past to predict the near future
    and do not adopt averaging as a default methodology.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the
    after-tax corporate profits average used by the trial judge did not adjust for non-recurring
    sources of income other than operations (for example, dividends received during
    the 2010 corporate reorganization). The Guidelines rely on pre-tax corporate
    income, which, depending on the pre-tax income figure adopted, can provide a
    more complete picture for analysis of recurring and non-recurring sources of
    income.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, averaging
    net after-tax profits did not recognize that Mikeys’ net profit levels tended
    to be higher in years with higher gross revenues.<a href="#_ftn14"
name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[14]</span></span></span></span></a> I highlight again that the Guidelines do not adopt averaging as a default
    methodology.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the
    trial judge’s apparent assumption that the parties’ $120,000 salaries paid in
    the years leading up to trial formed part of corporate profits was patently incorrect.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the
    wife, the parties began receiving salaries in the $120,000 range around the
    date of separation in November 2011. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, Mikeys
    sustained an after-tax loss of $235,067 in the fiscal year ended April 30,
    2013. Accordingly, the parties’ $120,000 salaries paid between April 30, 2012
    and April 30, 2013 (i.e., the fiscal year ended April 30, 2013) were paid from
    retained earnings, not from profits - as the trial judge apparently assumed.
    Moreover, the husband’s and wife’s salaries in the preceding calendar year,
    2011, were not in the same range: $60,293 and $62,793, respectively. Had the
    trial judge adopted the Guidelines methodology, he could not have added any
    portion of the wife’s salary from a year in which Mikeys sustained a loss to
    the husband’s line 150 income: s. 18 of the Guidelines.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the
    foregoing reasons, I conclude that the trial judge’s approach to determining
    the husband’s income, including his unexplained departure from the Guidelines,
    was unreasonable and clearly wrong.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give
    effect on appeal to the wife’s argument that the husband failed to raise at
    trial the issue of applying the Guidelines to the calculation of income. For
    the reasons I have explained, because the trial judge relied solely on the
    SSAGs to determine the quantum of spousal support (as the wife asked him to do),
    he was obliged to consider the Guidelines when determining the husband’s income.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I would
    note that although there was evidence at trial that the husband had undeclared
    cash income in prior years and that the business paid various personal expenses
    for the parties, I am not persuaded that such evidence would support the trial
    judge’s approach to determining the husband’s income or his finding that the
    husband had business income and profits totaling $400,000 available to him for
    spousal support purposes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence
    concerning the extent of the undeclared cash income varied widely. The trial
    judge made no findings concerning cash income in prior years, declined to
    impute cash income on a going forward basis and did not otherwise advert to the
    issue in his reasons for determining the husband’s income. In my view, the
    trial judge’s reasons do not reflect a conclusion that the business generated
    significant undeclared cash income in prior years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the
    personal expenses paid by the business, the trial judge made no findings
    concerning the extent of such expenses that had been paid in the past and the
    corporate tax returns are not part of the appeal record. Further, the trial
    judge made no reference to such payments in arriving at the $400,000 figure. Finally,
    where the parties accessed corporate funds through their shareholders’ loan accounts,
    this did not artificially reduce corporate income.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the
    circumstances, I would set aside the trial judge’s finding concerning the
    husband’s income as being unreasonable and therefore clearly wrong.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span style='line-height:200%'>(iii)<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To determine the
    husband’s income, I would follow the approach set out in the SSAGs and use the Guidelines
    as the starting point for determining income. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that
    I will explain, I conclude that a proper interpretation of s. 17 of the Guidelines
    permits a court to consider a payor’s income “over the last three years” to
    determine an income that “is fair and reasonable” and that, in that context,
    the payor’s income over the last three years includes amounts of pre-tax
    corporate income that the court considers appropriate to add to the payor’s
    income under s. 18 of the Guidelines for each such year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, I
    have considered the husband’s income for 2011 to 2013, including amounts
    available to him from pre-tax corporate income, and have determined an amount
    that I consider fair and reasonable.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As noted in my
    summary of the husband’s position, the interpretation of the Guidelines’
    provisions regarding adding pre-tax corporate income to a payor shareholder’s
    income is unsettled. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The controversy in
    the case law surrounds whether, in the case of a payor who is a shareholder,
    director or officer of a corporation and where the court is of the opinion that
    the payor’s line 150 income does not fairly reflect all the money available to
    the payor for the payment of support, the court is restricted to including in a
    payor’s annual income pre-tax corporate income from <em>only</em> the most
    recent taxation year. Relying on <em>Bear v. Thompson</em>, a decision of the
    Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, the husband supports this position. I would adopt
    a different approach.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will repeat
    the relevant portions of ss. 15 to 18 of the CSGs for ease of reference:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>15. Subject to subsection (2), a … spouse’s annual
    income is determined by the court in accordance with sections 16 to 20.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>16. Subject to sections 17 to 20, a … spouse’s annual
    income is determined using the sources of income set out under the heading
    “Total income” in the T1 General form issued by the Canada Revenue Agency and
    is adjusted in accordance with Schedule III.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>17. (1) If the court is of the opinion that the determination
    of a … spouse’s annual income under section 16 would not be the fairest
    determination of that income, the court may have regard to the … spouse’s
    income over the last three years and determine an amount that is fair and
    reasonable in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income or receipt
    of a non-recurring amount during those years.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>18. (1) Where a … spouse is a shareholder, director
    or officer of a corporation and the court is of the opinion that the amount of
    the … spouse’s annual income as determined under section 16 does not fairly
    reflect all the money available to the … spouse for the payment of child
    support, the court may consider the situations described in section 17 and
    determine the … spouse’s annual income to include,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) all or part of the pre-tax income of the
    corporation, and of any corporation that is related to that corporation, for
    the most recent taxation year …</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said,
    s. 19 sets out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which a court may
    impute income to a spouse and is set out in full both at para. 60 above and in
    Appendix ‘C’.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Bear v. Thompson</span></em>, the Saskatchewan Court
    of Appeal conducted an extensive review of the case law relating to the proper
    interpretation of ss. 17 and 18 of the Guidelines and also considered the
    interpretation of those provisions having regard to the modern rule of
    statutory interpretation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court
    concluded that s. 17 is a stand-alone provision directed at allowing the court
    to consider the payor’s line 150 income over the last three years and to determine
    an amount that is fair and reasonable in light of any pattern of, or
    fluctuation in such income during that period or receipt of a non-recurring
    amount. The court found that s. 17 does not permit including pre-tax corporate
    income as a source of funds in making this assessment. Further, while s. 18
    permits considering corporate income over the last three years to determine the
    amount of any pre-tax corporate income that should be added to a payor’s line
    150 income, it does not permit adding to line 150 income amounts of pre-tax
    corporate income that exceed the corporation’s income for the most recent
    taxation year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that the
    modern rule of statutory interpretation should be used to interpret the
    Guidelines.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[15]</span></span></span></span></a> Nonetheless, I would not adopt this restrictive interpretation of ss. 17 and 18.
    In my view, a review of the Guidelines as a whole compels a different
    conclusion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular,
    as I read the Guidelines, s. 17 does not restrict a court to considering line
    150 income over the last three years; rather a court may also consider amounts
    of pre-tax corporate income included in a spouse’s income under s. 18 for each
    of the last three years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of
    ss. 15 to 20 is to arrive at a number that fairly and fully reflects the
    payor’s income.  The default is that this number will simply be determined
    using line 150 income.  Where, however, the court determines that this default
    determination would be unfair, the Guidelines permit an expanded view of
    income. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the purposes
    of this appeal, I see the highlights of the income determination provisions of
    the Guidelines as being:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>s. 15 provides that a spouse’s <u>annual income </u>is determined

    that would not be the fairest determination of <u>annual income</u>, the court
    may have regard to the spouse’s <u>income</u> over the last three years to
    determine a fair and reasonable amount in light of, among other things, any
    pattern of, or fluctuations in, income;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>under s. 18, if the spouse is a shareholder, director or officer
    of a corporation and the court determines that s. 16 produces an amount of <span
class=Underline>annual income</span> that does not fairly reflect all the money
    available to the spouse to pay support, the court may determine the spouse’s <u>annual
    income</u> to include all or part of the pre-tax income of the corporation <u>for
    the most recent taxation year</u>; and </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>s. 19 sets out a non-exhaustive list of circumstances in which a
    court may impute income to a spouse.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[16]</span></span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    scheme of these provisions is that s. 18 permits a court to take an annual
    snapshot of a spouse’s income – and include in it pre-tax corporate income from
    the most recent taxation year. If the corporation suffered a loss in the most
    recent taxation year, no amount of pre-tax corporate income may be included. Under
    s. 17 however, the court may determine an amount that is fair and reasonable
    having regard to the spouse’s income over the last three years in light of,
    among other things, any pattern of, or fluctuations in, income over the
    three-year period. And “income” for that purpose may include amounts of pre-tax
    corporate income added to line 150 income under s. 18 for each of those years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I see it, it
    would make little sense to permit consideration of a spouse’s income over the
    three-year period without permitting consideration of the spouse’s access to
    pre-tax corporate income in each year of the three-year period. This is
    particularly the case where, as here, the payor spouse now wholly owns the corporation
    (which was formerly owned by him and the wife). Otherwise, the exercise of
    considering a pattern of, or fluctuations in, income would be artificial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, this
    interpretation, is consistent with the language of s. 17:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>17. (1) If the court is of the opinion that the
    determination of a … spouse’s annual income under section 16 would not be the
    fairest determination of that income, <span class=Underline>the court may</span> have regard to the … spouse’s income over the last three years and <span
class=Underline>determine an amount that is fair and reasonable in light of any
    pattern of income</span>, fluctuation in income or receipt of a non-recurring
    amount during those years. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had it been the
    legislature’s intention to restrict the three-year review of the spouse’s
    income to line 150 income, the legislature could easily have said the court may
    have regard to the spouse’s annual income over the last three years as
    determined under s. 16. But instead of using that or similar language, s. 17
    refers to the “spouse’s income over the last three years.” “Income” in this
    context is not restricted to the spouse’s annual income as determined under s.
    16; it can fairly be read as meaning the payor’s annual income as defined under
    s. 15 – meaning the payor’s income as determined in accordance with ss. 16 to
    20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition,
    interpreting the sections in this way avoids any incentive to manipulate
    corporate income leading up to a trial or the inevitability of a variation in
    the event of an unusual year.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach is
    also consistent with the fundamental object of the <em><span style='line-height:

    to their children, in determining what amount of money is in fact reasonably
    available for the payment of support. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I am

    or egregious results for corporations or that courts will disregard legitimate
    corporate interests. In attributing pre-tax corporate income to a payor for any
    particular year, it will be incumbent on the court to have regard to the status
    of the corporation as a distinct legal personality as well as to legitimate
    corporate interests in retaining pre-tax corporate income and the degree of the
    payor’s involvement in the corporation. See <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Brophy

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[170]<span

    led much evidence, be it expert or otherwise, concerning the question of what,

    income. As such, a court is left to do its best to resolve the issue with the
    evidence that is available. This is also consistent with achieving a just,
    expeditious and least expensive determination of the parties’ dispute.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beginning with
    2013 and s. 18, the husband’s income for 2013 was $127,161.<a href="#_ftn18"

style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[18]</span></span></span></span></a> However, Mikeys suffered a loss in 2013. It is not therefore possible to
    attribute any pre-tax corporate income to the husband for 2013 under s. 18.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to s.
    17, I conclude that the husband’s line 150 income for 2013 would not be the
    fairest determination of his income for two reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, although Mikeys
    suffered a loss in 2013, a review of Mikeys’ pre-tax income for past years as
    well as the prevailing circumstances in 2013 demonstrates that 2013 was an
    exceptional year and that Mikeys was likely to rebound from that loss. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the
    parties had a history of using corporate income to pay various personal
    expenses and taking monies from the corporation when they required them, albeit
    often through the mechanism of accessing their shareholders’ loan accounts. In
    the light of this history, it is reasonable to assume the husband would
    continue to access corporate profits in the future.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[175]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beginning with Mikeys’
    future prospects, as a starting point, the company had generated a profit in
    both 2011 and 2012. Moreover, Mikeys had not previously sustained a loss since
    2000. In addition, many of the circumstances surrounding the 2013 loss were
    unusual.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[176]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, the
    wife began working part-time in August 2012 (part of the fiscal year ended
    April 30, 2013) and left the day-to-day management of the business in January
    2013. Throughout fiscal 2013, the matrimonial dispute between the two owners
    was ongoing – and, at times, apparently disruptive to the working environment.
    Further, the bookkeeping system was changed through an update to the existing
    software program. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[177]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These factors
    would not only have been disruptive to the business; they would also have contributed
    to increased bookkeeping costs. At trial, the husband testified that issues
    arising out of the change to the bookkeeping system had been resolved. And
    while the trial judge found that the wife would have to be replaced by more
    than one bookkeeper, Mikeys would no longer be paying her salary in addition to
    the salary of the replacements bookkeepers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[178]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mikeys’ accountant
    testified that other factors contributing to the 2013 loss included the local
    economy and increased inventory financing costs. However, he provided no
    assistance concerning whether these factors were likely to continue to impact Mikeys’
    profitability. In his evidence, the husband seemed to suggest that increased
    inventory financing costs were the result of the wife’s refusal to sign a guarantee
    while she remained a shareholder. And while the husband expressed concerns
    about the future profitability of the business, on the first day of trial, he
    agreed to purchase the wife’s interest in the business, apparently based on
    valuations that had been prepared as of October 2011. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[179]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account
    of all the circumstances, it is reasonable to project that Mikeys would rebound
    from its loss in 2013. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[180]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the
    parties’ past use of corporate income, it was undisputed at trial that the
    parties used significant funds from their shareholders’ loan accounts to pay
    construction costs when they built their new house. Further, as illustrated by
    the motion judge’s ruling on interim child support, historically, the company
    also paid various personal expenses for the parties such as house related
    expenses, gasoline, insurance, health coverage and personal travel expenses. In
    addition, around the time of separation, the husband withdrew close to $100,000
    from his shareholder’s loan account to buy a sports car. And around the same
    time, although the expense was eventually disallowed either in whole or in part
    by the Canada Revenue Agency, the business paid around $60,000 for a Cadillac
    SUV for the wife. The husband also took several vacations in the time frame leading
    up to trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[181]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the
    circumstances, I conclude that it would be reasonable to notionally include
    some component of pre-tax corporate profits in the husband’s income for past
    years for the purpose of assessing a fair and reasonable amount under s. 17. Although
    the wife remained a shareholder during these years, this is a notional
    calculation performed to assess the husband’s current income. Moreover, for the
    future, any component of the salary the wife would have received that is not
    required to pay for bookkeeping expenses and that can be paid from pre-tax
    corporate income may be available for distribution to the husband.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[182]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For 2011 and
    2012, the husband’s line 150 income was $60,293 and $127,161 respectively while
    Mikeys’ pre-tax corporate income, over and above management salaries, was
    $346,549 and $269,165 respectively.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[19]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[183]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The wife did not
    take the position that 100% of corporate profits should be added to the
    husband’s income. Nor would that be reasonable. Historically, Mikeys operated
    on the basis of accumulating significant retained earnings while, at the same
    time, at least in the recent past, generating a comfortable standard of living
    for the owners. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[184]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all the
    circumstances, I consider it reasonable to attribute a significant portion of
    the company’s pre-tax earnings to the husband for the years 2011 and 2012. I
    would attribute $200,000 (of $346,549) to the husband for 2011 and $130,000 (of
    $269,165) for 2012. The husband’s line 150 income in 2011 was $60,293, $127,161
    in 2012 and $127,161 in 2013. Adding these amounts together yields the
    following incomes for the three-year period 2011 to 2013: $260,293 in 2011;
    $257,161 in 2012; and $127,161 in 2013.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[185]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 17 of
    the Guidelines permits a court to determine an amount of income that is “fair
    and reasonable in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income or
    receipt of a non-recurring amount” during the preceding three years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[186]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons
    I have already explained, I have concluded it was likely that Mikeys would rebound
    from the loss it sustained in 2013. While declining somewhat, the husband’s
    income was essentially stable in 2011 and 2012, revealing a pattern of income
    prior to the year in which Mikey’s incurred an exceptional loss. That said,
    taking account of the 2013 corporate loss, it would be unfair to attribute a
    current income to the husband at the level of his 2011-2012 income. In these
    particular circumstances, to bring a measure of fairness to both parties, I
    conclude that it would be appropriate to average the husband’s income over the
    last three years. This yields an annual income of $214,872.</p>
  <h2><span style='line-height:200%'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>     Did the trial judge err in
    determining the wife’s income?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[187]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I said in the
    Introduction, during oral argument, the wife acknowledged that the trial judge
    failed to take account of the interest she is receiving in relation to the
    balance owing on the equalization payment or consider that she would be able to
    invest that balance once it is received. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[188]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband submits
    that the wife would receive average interest pursuant to the Minutes of
    Settlement of $16,800 per year during the first three years of the payout of
    her equalization payment, $10,000 in the fourth year and $5,000 in the fifth year.
    The husband also claims that the wife could generate investment income of $15,000
    per year on the remaining equalization payment. Adding these sums to the
    $82,500 the trial judge used for his support calculation, the husband submits
    that the wife’s income is at least $114,500<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[20]</span></span></span></span></a> over the next three years, and then gradually decreases to $97,500, as the
    equalization installments are paid. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[189]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    husband’s calculations are incorrect. The wife will only begin generating
    additional interest on the full balance of the equalization payment once it is
    received. However, until she receives the full balance, she will receive
    interest at 4% on the outstanding balance as required under the Minutes of
    Settlement and she will also be able to generate interest on payments on
    account of the outstanding balance as they are received. I would estimate the
    total of these amounts taking account of the following factors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[190]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining
    the wife’s income, the trial judge adopted an effective interest rate of 4.5%
    for the income he attributed to the wife from investing the upfront equalization
    payment of $1,000,000 ($40,000 to $50,000, or a midpoint of $45,000).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[191]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given that the
    wife is receiving 4% interest on the balance owing on the equalization payment
    from time to time and assuming the wife will be able to invest the installments
    she receives at the 4.5% rate used by the trial judge, I would adopt 4.25% as
    an appropriate rate at which to attribute income to the wife on the balance of
    the equalization payment until it is received in full.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[192]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the balance
    owing on the equalization payment was $636,130, using an effective interest
    rate of 4.25%, I would attribute interest income to the wife of approximately $27,035
    per year. This brings her income for the purposes of determining spousal
    support to a total of $109,535. </p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>          Did the trial judge err in failing to consider the impact of
    the settlement on the appellant's earning capacity?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[193]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As recommended
    under s. 9.6 of the SSAGs, I will consider this issue when assessing the proper
    level of support. Taking that and the adjustments I have made to the husband’s
    income into account, I consider it unnecessary to address this issue further.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(6)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>          Did the trial judge err in holding that the wife is entitled
    to spousal support? </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[194]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband points
    to the significant payouts the wife received under the Minutes of Settlement
    and asserts that the trial judge failed to recognize the modern nature of the
    marriage and the benefits the wife received from the marriage. Moreover, having
    regard to the payments the wife received and her business skills, the husband
    contends that the trial judge erred in failing to find she was self-sufficient.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[195]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;I would
    not accept this submission. Although the wife did acquire substantial benefits
    from the marriage, the business and the marriage were intertwined. The trial
    judge recognized that, because of the breakdown of the marriage, it was
    virtually inevitable that the wife would have to relinquish her stake in the
    business. In doing so, the wife lost the ability to generate the significant
    income she was able to earn while married and working in the business as an
    owner. Although the assets the wife received would generate some income, those
    earnings plus her income from employment would not approach the income the wife
    earned in the business. The trial judge did not err in recognizing that the
    wife suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the breakdown of the
    marriage or in awarding spousal support to the wife as a result. </p>
  <h2><span style='line-height:200%'>(7)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>     Should the husband’s fresh
    evidence be admitted?&nbsp;</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[196]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband
    applies to introduce fresh evidence in the form of two affidavits, one from him,
    explaining how the property settlement has been paid and the impact that has
    had upon him and the second from his new accountant, explaining income tax
    consequences arising from the spousal support award and property settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[197]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;I would
    not admit this evidence. Both the husband and his accountant at the time
    testified at trial. The husband does not seriously contest that the evidence he
    now seeks to adduce could have been led at trial. The proposed evidence thus fails
    on the first branch of the test for admission of fresh evidence as articulated
    in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Palmer v. The Queen</span></em>, [1980] 1
    S.C.R. 759, at p. 775. See, also, <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Sengmueller
    v. Sengmueller</span></em>, 17 O.R. (3d) 208 (C.A.), at p. 210-11. It is not in
    the interests of justice in this case to permit the husband to adduce evidence that
    was delivered close to the eve of the appeal hearing that could have been led
    at trial. </p>
  <h2><span style='line-height:200%'>(8)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>     Adjusted SSAGs calculation</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[198]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the revised
    income figures of $214,872 per year for the husband and $109,535 for the wife,
    a total period of cohabitation of 20 years commencing in 1991, and the “with
    child” support formula, the SSAGs produce a range for spousal support of $0 to
    $1,678, with a mid-range of $767.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[199]<span

style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[21]</span></span></span></span></a> provides that courts should avoid the tendency to “default” to the mid-range
    amount of spousal support. Section 9 of the 2016 Revised User’s Guide
    explicitly states, “[t]he mid-point of the SSAG ranges for amount should NOT be
    treated as the default outcome.” In determining the appropriate quantum of
    support within the range, a court is required to consider the support factors
    and objectives found in the <em>Divorce Act</em> and the <em>Family Law Act</em>.
    The SSAGs also provide a number of factors to consider while choosing a
    location within the range, including the strength of the recipient’s
    compensatory claim, the recipient’s need, property division and debts, and the
    payor’s needs and ability to pay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[200]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 9.1 of
    the SSAGs provide, “[a] strong compensatory claim will be a factor that favours
    a support award at the higher end of the ranges both for amount and duration.”
    The wife has a strong compensatory claim. The parties cohabited for at least 20
    years. During their marriage, the wife worked with the husband to establish a
    successful business. Post-separation, the wife is no longer in a position to
    work in and benefit directly from the business. She suffered a significant
    disadvantage as a result of the breakdown of the marriage: <em>Divorce Act</em>,
    s. 15.2(6)(a); <em>Bracklow v. Bracklow</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420, at para. 41;
    see also <em>Racco v. Racco</em>, 2014 ONCA 330, 44 R.F.L. (7th) 348, at para.
    24.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[201]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of
    need is measured against the parties’ marital standard of living. The wife will
    be able to convert some of her assets from equalization into income, but it
    will not compare to that produced by the business. As the trial judge stated,
    self-sufficiency during the wife’s working life, measured against the marital
    standard of living, will be an elusive goal. On the whole, the wife’s claim to
    support suggests a result towards the high end of the range.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[202]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other
    hand, s. 9.6 clarifies that the SSAGs assume that the parties have accumulated
    the typical family property for couples of their age, incomes, and obligations,
    and property is divided equally. Significant departures from those assumptions
    may affect where support is fixed within the ranges. If the recipient receives
    a large amount of property, the low end of the range might be more appropriate.
    Here, the wife has received a substantial equalization payment of $1,636,130. Moreover,
    the equalization payment will negatively impact the funds available to the
    husband to pay support. These factors support a result in the lower end of the
    range.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[203]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further factor
    not directly addressed by the SSAGs, is that the parties agreed to a figure for
    child support that is based on the husband having an income of $136,500 and
    that is below full Guidelines support for that income in any event. This factor
    supports a figure in the upper end of the range.<a href="#_ftn22"

    the trial judge ordered no costs up to the date of the offer. It is also
    significant in my view that neither party brought the relevant provisions of

  <p class=LegislativeQuote>15. (1) Subject to subsection (2), a parent’s or

    16 to 20. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Agreement</span></strong></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) Where both parents or spouses agree in writing on
    the annual income of a parent or spouse, the court may consider that amount to
    be the parent’s or spouse’s income for the purposes of these guidelines if the
    court thinks that the amount is reasonable having regard to the income
    information provided under section 21. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Calculation
    of annual income</span></strong></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>16. Subject to sections 17 to 20, a parent’s or
    spouse’s annual income is determined using the sources of income set out under
    the heading “Total income” in the T1 General form issued by the Canada Revenue
    Agency and is adjusted in accordance with Schedule III. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Pattern

  <p class=LegislativeQuote>17. (1) If the court is of the opinion that the
    determination of a parent’s or spouse’s annual income under section 16 would
    not be the fairest determination of that income, the court may have regard to
    the parent’s or spouse’s income over the last three years and determine an
    amount that is fair and reasonable in light of any pattern of income,
    fluctuation in income or receipt of a non-recurring amount during those years. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Non-recurring

  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) Where a parent or spouse has incurred a
    non-recurring capital or business investment loss, the court may, if it is of
    the opinion that the determination of the parent’s or spouse’s annual income
    under section 16 would not provide the fairest determination of the annual
    income, choose not to apply sections 6 and 7 of Schedule III, and adjust the
    amount of the loss, including related expenses and carrying charges and
    interest expenses, to arrive at such amount as the court considers appropriate. </p>

    amount of the parent’s or spouse’s annual income as determined under section 16
    does not fairly reflect all the money available to the parent or spouse for the
    payment of child support, the court may consider the situations described in
    section 17 and determine the parent’s or spouse’s annual income to include,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) all or part of the pre-tax income of the
    corporation, and of any corporation that is related to that corporation, for
    the most recent taxation year; or</p>

  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) the parent or spouse is intentionally
    under-employed or unemployed, other than where the under-employment or

    Income for each of those years: 2011 - $346,549; 2012 - 266,990; 2013 –
