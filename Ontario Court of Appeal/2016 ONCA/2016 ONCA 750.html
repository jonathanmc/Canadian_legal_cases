  <p class=Heard>On appeal from the conviction entered on September 1, 2014 and
    the sentence imposed on December 9, 2014 by Justice Johanne N. Morissette of
    the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The appellant appeals
    his conviction following a trial by jury on one count of sexual interference
    against his stepdaughter when she was between the ages of 6 and 12. The
    complainant was 19 years old at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The appellant’s main
    ground of appeal is trial unfairness. Specifically, the appellant submits that
    the breach by Crown counsel at trial (not Crown counsel on appeal) of their
    agreement not to cross-examine the appellant on his post-arrest conduct
    resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The parties had agreed
    that unless the appellant raised the issues himself, Crown counsel would not
    cross-examine the appellant about his departure and six-month absence from the
    jurisdiction after he was arrested and charged, his failure to attend his first
    preliminary inquiry, and his subsequent guilty plea, conviction and 30-day
    intermittent sentence for failing to attend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The appellant made no
    mention of these matters during his examination in chief. It was only in
    response to Crown counsel’s question during his cross-examination: “And did you
    want to clear these charges up as soon as possible?”, that the appellant
    stated:  “No.  I left the jurisdiction, but I came all the way across Canada
    and turned myself in to the London Police Station on my own accord.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Crown counsel asked
    that the jury retire and sought a ruling that he be permitted to ask the
    appellant about his departure, absence from the jurisdiction, and subsequent
    guilty plea and sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In response, defence
    counsel vigorously objected to the appropriateness of Crown counsel’s question
    and to his request that he be permitted to ask further questions about these
    issues.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge
    concluded that because the appellant could have answered the Crown’s question
    with “Yes, I wanted to” but instead said, “No”, he had put these matters into
    issue. As a result, she ruled that Crown counsel could “flesh out why he was
    charged and convicted, and arrested”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Crown counsel then
    proceeded to cross-examine the appellant about his failure to attend his first
    preliminary hearing court date, turning himself into the police station six
    months later, being charged with the criminal offence of failing to attend
    court, his conviction and 30-day intermittent sentence. The appellant explained
    that he left the jurisdiction because he was frightened and needed to clear his
    head but that he returned to take responsibility for not attending the first
    preliminary inquiry. On re-examination, the appellant explained that he pled
    guilty because he had come back and wanted to prove that he was innocent to the
    two young sons whom he wanted to keep seeing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In his closing, after
    pointing out that the complainant and the appellant gave diametrically opposed
    versions of the relevant events, Crown counsel said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>My friend stated, in his argument, in his
    closing argument that Mr. J. is innocent, he was honest and had nothing to
    hide. Well, he hid himself for six months.  R.J.’s version of what happened
    simply makes no sense at all. The entirety of the evidence that you heard over
    the past week can only lead to guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge
    instructed the jury that the appellant’s explanation for his leaving the
    jurisdiction was plausible and that it would be wrong in law for the jury to
    rely solely on the appellant’s post-arrest conduct to find him guilty of the
    charged offence. However, she gave no caution to the jury about using the
    post-arrest conduct to assess the appellant’s credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>On September 5, 2014,
    the jury found the appellant guilty of sexual interference. On December 9,
    2014, he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years, less 144 days of
    pre-sentence custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>We agree that Crown
    counsel’s question opened the door to the appellant’s response concerning his
    post-arrest conduct and resulted in unfairness to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Crown counsel asked a question
    that arguably invited a one-word answer, either “yes” or “no”. Witnesses,
    however, often do not provide the anticipated answer. Crown counsel should reasonably
    have foreseen the possibility that the question would lead the appellant into
    evidence about his post-arrest conduct.  Crown counsel should not have asked
    the question in front of the jury without first vetting the question with the
    trial judge and giving counsel for the defence an opportunity to raise the
    propriety of the question.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It was at least reasonably
    foreseeable that the question posed by Crown counsel would lead into the areas
    that counsel had agreed would not be the subject of evidence unless first
    raised by the appellant. Crown counsel’s question was ill-advised and generated
    evidence that should not have been before the jury given the agreement between
    counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The effect of the
    introduction of the appellant’s post-arrest conduct was not minor. It affected
    the jury’s assessment of the appellant’s credibility and prejudiced the appellant
    in his defence.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits
    that if he had known that his conviction would be introduced at trial, he may
    very well have presented his evidence and conducted his defence in a different
    way. To the appellant’s detriment, the breach occurred at the end of his
    cross-examination and took the appellant completely by surprise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>More significant,
    however, was the risk of prejudice caused by Crown counsel inviting the jury in
    his closing to use the evidence of the appellant’s post-arrest conduct to
    negatively assess the appellant’s credibility, and the absence of any jury
    instruction not to use this evidence for that purpose.</span></p>
