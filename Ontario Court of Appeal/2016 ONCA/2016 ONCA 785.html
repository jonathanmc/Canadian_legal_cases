  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Brian Snell, appearing as duty counsel</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Susan Magotiaux, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard: October 6, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on May 5, 2008 and
    the sentence imposed on July 6, 2011 by Justice Thomas P. Cleary of the Ontario
    Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The trial judge
    subsequently declared him to be a dangerous offender and sentenced him to indeterminate
    detention under s. 753(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault. While the
    notice of appeal included a sentence appeal, it was not pursued. If the
    conviction appeal is successful, then the sentence would fall. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In procedural terms, the appellant was convicted on May 5, 2008 and
    sentenced on July 6, 2011. Between the conviction and sentencing dates, he was
    tried, convicted and sentenced on other charges by Justice Antonio Di Zio,
    which led to the companion appeal (C59054). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues the reasons of the trial judge are insufficient to
    justify conviction, citing <em>R. v. Wigle</em>, 2009 ONCA 604, 252 O.A.C. 209.
    To pass muster, the reasons must “advance the accused's understanding of the
    reasons for his conviction” and “facilitate meaningful appellate review of the
    correctness of the decision”: <em>R. v. Brown </em>(2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 619
    (C.A.), at para. 26. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>R. v. Vuradin</em>, 2013
    SCC 38, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 639, at para 11: “Credibility determinations by a trial
    judge attract a high degree of deference.” Further, the Court noted the
    importance of a contextual approach, at para. 12:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Ultimately, appellate courts considering the sufficiency of
    reasons &quot;should read them as a whole, in the context of the evidence, the
    arguments and the trial, with an appreciation of the purposes or functions for
    which they are delivered&quot;: [<em>R. v. R.E.M.</em>, 2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3
    S.C.R. 3], at para. 16. These purposes &quot;are fulfilled if the reasons, read
    in context, show why the judge decided as he or she did&quot; (para. 17).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key issues in the case were the complainant’s credibility and the
    presence or absence of consent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, in about 30 pages of reasons, noted points at which the
    complainant’s evidence about the events over the course of the evening was
    corroborated by other evidence. The assault itself was not corroborated, which
    is not unusual. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons record the following evidence. The
    complainant, K.M., testified she was sexually assaulted on January 13, 2007 in
    the front seat of the appellant’s car in the parking lot of a McDonald’s
    restaurant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant’s evidence was that after the assault in the McDonald’s
    parking lot, the appellant drove her to a Coffee Time restaurant. She used the
    washroom and then sat with the appellant in the restaurant for about 13 minutes,
    according to the restaurant video. Two Coffee Time employees described her distraught
    state. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant told the complainant he would drive her home, so she
    returned to his car. When she was back in his car, the appellant told her to
    remove her pants. She immediately got out of the car without her shoes or a
    jacket. Her actions in leaving the appellant’s car and crossing the street to an
    Esso service station were captured by video. She called the police from there.
    They found her distraught and shoeless in the service station kiosk, in the
    middle of winter. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify. Counsel argues that the actions of the
    complainant in sitting with the appellant in the Coffee Time restaurant is
    enough to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s consent to sexual
    intercourse. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the trial judge observed, the complainant’s mental and physical state
    and her state of dress in winter weather, were all inconsistent with any such
    consent. The trial judge noted: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I am] satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was
    proved a lack of consent for the physical action of intercourse that took
    place. As I said before, that does not end the inquiry, but I want to indicate
    the reason is I accept her evidence that she said no, that she tried to push
    him away, that she made some comments about “why you’re doing this to me? What
    if you had a daughter”, which from a reasonable man’s point of view would
    clearly be indicating non-consent.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He added:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I have] reviewed the evidence of the complainant that I
    accepted to arrive at the decision that she – it has been shown beyond a
    reasonable doubt she was not consenting, and considered the circumstances that
    I had before me, keeping in mind that I can only make true inferences on the
    basis of a reasonable view of facts proven.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering the reasons as a whole, and the context of unfolding events,
    it is clear that the trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence that she
    was forced into sexual intercourse. There was no contrary evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record is sufficient to allow the appellant to understand why he was
    convicted and to permit meaningful appellate review. We would therefore not
    give effect to the argument that the trial judge’s reasons are insufficient. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
