  <p class=Judge><strong><span style='font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>Simmons J.A.:</span></strong></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Under s. 268 of the </span><em>Insurance
    Act</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 (the “Act”), statutory
    accident benefits (“SABs”) are provided for in every automobile insurance policy
    in Ontario so that persons injured in automobile accidents in Ontario and
    Ontario residents injured in car accidents outside Ontario are entitled to receive
    SABs regardless of fault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In this case, Scott Wright applied
    to Ayr Farmers Mutual Insurance Company for SABs, claiming that he was injured when
    he tried to close his garage door after backing his vehicle out of his garage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ayr Farmers denied Mr. Wright’s claim
    for SABs, saying that his injuries were not the result of an “accident” as defined
    in the </span><em>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule – Effective September 1,
    2010</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, O. Reg. 34/10 (the “Schedule”), and that
    he was not therefore entitled to SABs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Sections 279 to 283 of the Act set
    out a mandatory scheme for resolving disputes “in respect of any insured person’s
    entitlement to statutory accident benefits” (the “s. 279 scheme”). The s. 279 scheme
    requires that parties submit disputes in respect of entitlement to SABs to mediation
    before any court proceeding can be brought: ss. 279, 281(2).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Wright applied for mediation under
    the s. 279 scheme to resolve his dispute with Ayr Farmers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Rather than attend the mediation, Ayr
    Farmers issued an application under rule 14 of the </span><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, R.R.O. 1990, O. Reg. 194, requesting a determination
    of whether Mr. Wright was involved in an accident within the meaning of the Schedule. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On its application, Ayr Farmers argued
    that the question whether Mr. Wright was involved in an accident is a preliminary
    issue that must be determined before the s. 279 scheme applies. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ayr Farmers emphasized that the s.
    279 scheme addresses disputes “in respect of any insured person’s entitlement to
    statutory accident benefits” and that, under the scheme, it is either an “insured
    person” or an “insurer” who may submit a dispute to mediation. To qualify as an
    “insured person” under the Schedule, a SABs claimant must have been involved in
    an “accident” as defined in the Schedule. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>According to Ayr Farmers, where the
    question whether a claimant was involved in an accident has not been acknowledged
    or determined, the s. 279 scheme does not apply and either the claimant or the insurer
    may apply under rule 14 for a determination of that preliminary issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge rejected Ayr
    Farmers’ argument, holding that the s. 279 scheme governs all disputes concerning
    entitlement to SABs, including whether a claimant was involved in an accident and
    qualifies as an insured person under the Schedule. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge also found that
    this was not an appropriate case for an application. In his view, determining whether
    Mr. Wright was involved in an accident would require examining all the surrounding
    circumstances. The only material before the court was “a brief line” from Mr. Wright’s
    application for SABs. In other cases where similar issues had been determined on
    an application, either there were no material facts in dispute or there was an agreed
    statement of fact. That was not the case here, and the question whether Mr. Wright
    was involved in an accident should not be determined on this application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ayr Farmers raises two issues on appeal:<a

    that the answer to the first question is no. It is therefore unnecessary that I
    respond to the second question. I would also note that while both parties acknowledged
    at the appeal hearing that the s.&nbsp;279 scheme as it existed as of the date of
    the hearing before the application judge was amended effective April 1, 2016,<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> the arguments on this appeal were largely confined to the s. 279 scheme as it existed
    until March 31, 2016. This judgment should not therefore be read as opining on
    the amended scheme.</span></p>

    that the s. 279 scheme is a complete code for dealing with disputes between an </span><span
class=Underline>insured person</span><span style='line-height:200%'> and an insurer
    concerning SABs issues, including entitlement to particular kinds of benefits having
    regard to the injuries sustained and amounts payable. However, it relies on the
    fact that to qualify as an insured person as defined in the Schedule, Mr. Wright
    must have been involved in an “accident”, a term which is also defined in the Schedule.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ayr Farmers submits that the question
    whether Mr. Wright was involved in an accident – and therefore whether he qualifies
    as an insured person under the s. 279 scheme – is not a SABs issue but rather a
    coverage issue. According to Ayr Farmers, before the s. 279 scheme is triggered,
    the coverage issue must first be determined.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ayr Farmers contends that coverage
    issues are generally relatively simple. It says they can be more expeditiously and
    efficiently dealt with on a rule 14 application rather than under the s. 279 scheme.
    Coverage exists, or it does not. Coverage issues do not typically benefit from mediation.
    If the application judge’s interpretation is followed, it will deprive both insurer’s
    and SABs claimants of the ability to resort to the courts for an expeditious determination
    of a discrete issue that is unlikely to benefit from the processes built in to the
    s. 279 scheme.</span></p>

    erred because he conflated the definition of an “insured” under s. 224 of the Act
    with the definition of “insured person” under the Schedule. Mr. Wright is not entitled
    to invoke the 279 scheme just because he is a named insured in the policy. The s.
    279 scheme deals with an “insured person’s” entitlement to SABs benefits. To qualify
    as an insured person under the Schedule it is not enough that Mr. Wright is a named
    insured – he must also have been involved in an accident as defined in the Schedule.</span></p>

    Adopting a purposive approach to interpreting the s. 279 scheme, in my view, the
    application judge was correct in holding that it governs all disputes concerning
    entitlement to SABs, including whether a claimant was involved in an accident. I
    reach this conclusion for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, the s. 279 scheme establishes
    a comprehensive alternative process to the courts that includes a separate administrative
    body for resolving disputes between SABs claimants and insurers concerning
    entitlement to and the amount of benefits. The s. 279 scheme limits access to the
    courts and incentivizes claimants to pursue arbitration rather than litigation.
    In my view, interpreting the s. 279 scheme in a manner that would require either
    the SABs claimant or an insurer to apply to court for a preliminary determination
    of whether a claimant qualifies as an insured person is inconsistent with the creation
    of a comprehensive alternative dispute resolution process. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>, if mediation fails, the s. 279 scheme incentivizes insured
    persons to refer issues in dispute to arbitration under s. 282 rather than commencing
    court proceedings. For example, under s. 282(10) of the Act, if a s. 282 arbitrator
    finds that an insurer unreasonably withheld or delayed SABs payments, the arbitrator
    shall award a lump sum of up to 50 per cent of the amount to which the person was
    entitled at the time of the award with interest on the amount at the rate of two
    per cent per month. This remedy is only available if an insured person proceeds
    to arbitration with FSCO under s. 282. It thus encourages use of these services
    and also provides protection against insurers who unreasonably deny SABs claims. </span></p>

    commencing court proceedings prior to mediation in s. 281(2), the only issue that
    could be determined on a preliminary court proceeding in a case such as this is
    the question whether the SABs claimant qualifies as an insured person. On the other
    hand, if that question falls to be determined under the s. 279 scheme, in the
