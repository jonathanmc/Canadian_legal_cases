  <p class=Onappealfrom>On application for leave to appeal from the order of Justice
    John Murray of the Superior Court of Justice, dated April 11, 2014.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Simmons J.A.:</b></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial in the Ontario Court of Justice, the applicant was
    convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment and
    three years’ probation. The applicant failed to comply with orders setting
    timelines for perfection of his conviction and sentence appeal to the summary
    conviction appeal court. The summary conviction appeal court dismissed his
    appeal as abandoned and also dismissed his subsequent application to re-open
    his appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant now applies for leave to appeal the order dismissing his
    application to re-open his summary conviction appeal, seeks to file fresh
    evidence in support of his application and, if leave is granted, appeals the
    order dismissing his application to re-open. For the reasons that follow, I
    would admit the fresh evidence in part, grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal
    in part and order that the applicant be permitted to re-open his summary
    conviction appeal as it relates to sentence in the summary conviction appeal
    court. I would otherwise dismiss the application to admit fresh evidence and
    the appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 31, 2012, the applicant was convicted of sexual assault in
    relation to events that occurred on August 20, 2010. The trial judge found that
    the applicant, a taxi driver, sexually touched a female front seat passenger
    while she was riding in his cab. The touching began soon after the applicant
    dropped the young woman’s friend off at the friend’s home and continued as he
    drove the front seat passenger to her home. On October 25, 2012, the applicant
    was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment and three years’ probation for this
    offence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant appealed his conviction and sentence to the summary
    conviction appeal court. Although the applicant, who was by then
    self-represented, paid for and obtained the transcripts of his trial, he failed
    to comply with two orders setting time limits for him to perfect his appeal.
    The initial order required the applicant to file all material within 90 days; the
    subsequent order required that he file his appeal book and factum by March 20,
    2014, about 56 days after the initial deadline. As the applicant failed to meet
    the March 20, 2014 deadline, on March 21, 2014 a judge of the summary
    conviction appeal court dismissed the applicant’s conviction and sentence appeal
    as abandoned.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 3, 2014, the applicant applied to the summary conviction appeal
    court to re-open his appeal. He did not file an appeal book and factum with his
    application. Rather, he requested that the court provide him with a record of
    text messages and videos held by the police. On April 11, 2014<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='line-height:100%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a>,
    the applicant’s application to re-open his appeal was dismissed. The summary
    conviction appeal court judge noted that full disclosure would have been
    provided before trial and that, if the applicant sought to introduce fresh
    evidence, it was up to him to obtain it. </p>

    erred in law by failing to consider whether it was in the interests of justice

    second issue is that, on April 25, 2013, the applicant was ordered deported. As

    would decline to admit the fresh evidence relating to disclosure of the residential
    surveillance video. This evidence is advanced to establish that it was in the
    interests of justice to re-open the applicant’s appeal relating to his
    conviction. The material filed demonstrates only that a police officer viewed
    the video; it does not demonstrate that the police are now, or were ever, in
    possession of the video. Moreover, the applicant has failed to demonstrate how
    the surveillance video could possibly have affected the outcome of his trial.
    On the trial judge’s findings, the sexual assault began soon after the applicant
    dropped the complainant’s friend off at the friend’s home. The applicant’s
    defences at trial were consent and honest but mistaken belief in consent. The applicant
    has not advanced any argument to demonstrate how the content of the video,
    which apparently showed the complainant being dropped off at the residence,
    could have affected his position at trial. This portion of the proposed fresh
    evidence does not raise an arguable ground of appeal relating to the applicant’s
    conviction and therefore fails to demonstrate that it was in the interests of
    justice to re-open the applicant’s appeal or support the applicant’s request
    for leave to appeal the order declining to re-open his appeal. Accordingly, I
    would dismiss the application to introduce fresh evidence concerning the
    residential surveillance video. </span></span></p>
