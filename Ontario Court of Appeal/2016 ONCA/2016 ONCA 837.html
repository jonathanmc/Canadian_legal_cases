  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on October 31, 2014
    by Justice Susan E. Healey of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=Endorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault and break and enter and
    commit an indictable offence. The sole ground of appeal he raises is that the
    trial judge erred by finding that the video statement he gave to police upon
    arrest was voluntary and admissible in evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s position is that he was induced to make the statement, (which
    was essentially exculpatory) on the issue of consent, by comments made by
    Officer Baker on the approximately two-minute walk as he escorted the appellant
    to the interview room. The appellant alleged that the officer essentially told
    him that they would have to talk and figure things out and afterward he would
    be released. No recording or notes were made by the officer of a conversation,
    which he initially denied, but later acknowledged that he could have said that
    they would be having a conversation to figure things out. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the officer did say that they were going to
    have a conversation to figure things out, but that the officer did not suggest
    that he would then release the appellant, and therefore he did not hold out any
    inducement. The trial judge also analyzed the appellant’s conduct during the
    interview, and concluded, for a number of reasons which she stated, that the
    appellant’s decision to give the video statement was not causally connected to
    an alleged inducement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s main argument is that because the onus to prove
    voluntariness of a statement by an accused is on the Crown, and because there
    was no record made of the alleged conversation, once the trial judge found that
    some statement was made by the officer to the appellant about the upcoming
    interview, the Crown could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    statement of the appellant was not based on an inducement and therefore was not
    voluntary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission on the facts of this case. While it is
    important for police to record their interactions with accused persons, in this
    case, the conversation was very brief and held in circumstances on the walk to
    the interview room where the officer testified that he normally says nothing
    and believed he had said nothing in this case. Both the officer and the
    appellant testified as to what was said. Although the trial judge could have
    rejected the officer’s testimony as unreliable (because he had no notes of it),
    in the case of this brief interaction, she was entitled to make findings based
    on the evidence she heard as well as the full context of the arrest and
    interview process, and the interaction between the appellant and the officer,
    including the recorded interview. We see no basis to set aside her findings
    based on the evidence, which she explained fully in her reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we agree with the appellant that if an offer of release had been
    made in exchange for the appellant’s statement, that could have constituted a <em>quid
    pro quo</em> in law, we see no error in the trial judge’s finding that the
    Crown had proved that no such inducement was given.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the trial judge confused two branches of
    the voluntariness analysis, whether an inducement was given and whether the
    appellant’s will was overborne. While the trial judge did refer to the issue of
    the appellant’s will being overborne, we do not agree that she applied an
    incorrect test on the issue of whether there was a causal connection between
    the appellant’s decision to give a statement, and an alleged inducement by the
    officer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
