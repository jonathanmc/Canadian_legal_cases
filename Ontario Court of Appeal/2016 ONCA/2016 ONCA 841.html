  <p class=Heard>Heard:  September 12, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice W. Danial Newton of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated March 22, 2016, with reasons reported at
    2016 ONSC 2019, 130 O.R. (3d) 380.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.</strong><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]The
    appellant, Jevco Insurance Company, appeals the dismissal of its summary
    judgment motion. It submits that, in his reasons, the motion judge made a final
    determination of law that is wrong and that will be binding on the trial
    judge.  The respondent, Christopher Skunk, argues that the motion judge did not
    make a final, binding determination in his reasons, the order under appeal is
    not a final order and this appeal should accordingly be quashed for lack of
    jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]</span>I agree with Mr. Skunk. Because the order
    dismissing Jevco’s motion for summary judgment is not a final order, an appeal
    lies to the Divisional Court, with leave<span style='line-height:200%'>.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]Before
    setting out my analysis of why the order under appeal is not a final order, I
    will first provide the factual and legal background necessary to understand the
    nuances of the parties’ arguments on jurisdiction.    </p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Facts</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]The underlying
    action arises out of a motor vehicle accident in October 2012. Mr. Skunk
    alleges that he was a passenger in a motor vehicle owned by his spouse, Maureen
    Skunk, but driven by a friend of his, Laurel Ketash. He alleges that the
    accident arose from the negligence of Ms. Ketash, who did not have automobile
    insurance at the time of the accident. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]In addition
    to suing Ms. Ketash, Mr. Skunk commenced an action against Jevco pursuant to s.
    265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, and a standard Ontario
    Automobile Policy - OAP 1 (the “OAP” or the “Policy”) and the optional OPCF 44R
    Family Protection Coverage Endorsement (the “Endorsement”) issued to his spouse. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]In suing
    Jevco, Mr. Skunk sought to recover under the uninsured provisions in the Policy
    and Endorsement. To explain why Mr. Skunk took that route, it is necessary to
    provide some context as to how Ontario’s automobile insurance scheme works.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applicable Insurance Principles</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]Automobile
    insurance is compulsory in Ontario: <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act</i>,
    R. S. O. 1990, c. C. 25. The purpose of this legislation is to protect victims
    of automobile accidents “from having no means of seeking damages from persons
    who might have caused those damages without having the protection of automobile
    insurance”: <i>Matheson v. Lewis</i>, 2014 ONCA 542, 121 O.R. (3d) 641, at
    para. 36. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]The owner of
    a motor vehicle is liable for accidents caused by its operation under s. 192 of
    the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, except where subsection
    (2) applies, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><a name=s192s2></a>The owner of a motor vehicle or street car
    is liable for loss or damage sustained by any person by reason of negligence in
    the operation of the motor vehicle or street car on a highway, <u>unless the
    motor vehicle or street car was without the owner’s consent in the possession
    of some person other than the owner or the owner’s chauffeur. </u>[Emphasis
    added.]<u> </u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='line-height:200%'>The purpose of s. 192(2)</span> was noted in <i><span
style='line-height:200%'>Fernandes v. Araujo, </span></i><span
style='line-height:200%'>2015 ONCA 571<i>, </i>127 O.R. (3d) 115 (C.A.), at
    para. 20: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span style='color:black;background:white'>[T]he purpose of
    this provision is &quot;to protect the public by imposing, on the owner of a
    motor vehicle, responsibility for the careful management of the vehicle&quot;.</span></u> The provision is an integral element of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>'s
    mandatory licensing and insurance scheme to ensure the public safety. The owner
    has the right to give possession of the vehicle to another person, but this
    provision &quot;encourages owners to be careful when exercising that right by
    placing legal responsibility on them for loss to others caused by the negligent
    operation of the vehicle on a highway&quot;. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>I</span>f the motor vehicle is driven by
    a person who has the owner’s consent and is involved in an accident, s. 3.2 of
    the OAP provides coverage: “You are covered when you, or anyone else in
    possession of a described automobile with your consent, uses or operates it. We
    will consider these other people insured persons.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the normal course, if a person is injured by the operation of the
    motor vehicle in which he or she is a passenger, the vehicle owner’s insurer
    must respond.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But some owners fail to insure their automobile, or their insurance is
    voided, and so the automobile is not insured. The <i>Insurance Act</i> mandates
    a scheme to provide for limited insurance coverage where the operation of an
    uninsured automobile injures a person. The coverage is provided by the injured
    person’s own insurer, but coverage is limited to the minimum required by s. 251
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, which is $200,000 for liability claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to mitigate the consequences of being injured by an uninsured
    or underinsured motor vehicle, purchasers of automobile insurance policies in
    Ontario can buy, for an additional premium, added coverage in the form of the
    OPCF 44R Family Protection Coverage Endorsement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against that background, I now turn to consider Mr. Skunk’s claim and
    Jevco’s motion.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Skunk’s Claim and Jevco’s Motion</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Skunk did not sue his wife because he takes the position that Ms.
    Ketash was driving without Ms. Skunk’s consent so that under s. 192(2) of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> Ms. Skunk is not directly liable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead, Mr. Skunk sued Jevco. As he takes the position that his
    spouse’s vehicle ceased to be insured when Ms. Ketash drove it without Ms.
    Skunk’s consent, he sued  under the “uninsured automobile coverage” provisions
    in s. 5 of the Policy, the “inadequately insured motorist” provisions in the Endorsement,
    and s. 265 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, which defines the term “uninsured
    automobile”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its statement of defence, Jevco pleads that Mr. Skunk took possession
    of his spouse’s vehicle without her consent. It also takes the position that
    Ms. Ketash drove the vehicle without Ms. Skunk’s consent and, as a result, the
    vehicle became uninsured. However, Jevco takes the position that Mr. Skunk is
    excluded from uninsured coverage as the spouse of the vehicle’s owner based on the <i>Insurance Act</i>, the Policy and the Endorsement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 265(1) of the <em>Insurance Act</em> requires that every motor
    vehicle liability policy provide coverage for damages where there is liability
    on the part of an owner or driver of an uninsured automobile. Section 265(2)
    defines “uninsured automobile” as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>“uninsured automobile” means an
    automobile with respect to which </span><span class=Underline><span
style='text-decoration:none'>neither the owner nor driver thereof has
    applicable and collectible bodily injury liability and property damage
    liability insurance for its ownership, use or operation,</span> but does not
    include an automobile owned by or registered in the name of the insured or his
    or her spouse.</span><span style='color:#505050;background:white'> </span>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This definition, which excludes automobiles owned by or registered in
    the name of the insured or his or her spouse, is in turn incorporated in
    virtually identical terms in s. 5 of the Policy and in the Endorsement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of the Policy provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Uninsured Automobile Coverage</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>5.1 Introduction </b></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>5.1.1 Uninsured Automobile Coverage Schedule </b></p>
  <p class=CQuote>This Section of the policy describes the terms and conditions
    of the coverage set out in the Uninsured Automobile Schedule under the
    Insurance Act (Ontario). If there is a difference between the interpretation of
    the wording of this Section and the interpretation of the wording in the
    Schedule, the Schedule prevails. However, 5.3.3 in this Section is an addition
    to the coverage provided by the Schedule. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>5.1.2 What is an Uninsured Automobile? </b></p>
  <p class=CQuote>An uninsured automobile is one for which <span class=Underline>neither
    the owner nor driver has liability insurance to </span><span class=Underline><span

    of its ownership, use or operation, or the insurance is not collectible.
    However, </span>this does not include an automobile owned by or registered in

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jevco brought a motion for summary judgment in an effort to have Mr.
    Skunk’s claim against the company dismissed, The narrow issue before the motion
    judge was whether, with respect to Mr. Skunk’s claim, the vehicle was excluded
    from the definition of “uninsured automobile” because it was owned by Mr. Skunk’s
    spouse. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to Jevco’s motion, Mr. Skunk argued that, reading the
    Endorsement purposively, an automobile owned by or registered in the name of
    the insured or his or her spouse would be excluded from the definition of an “uninsured
    automobile” only if the insured or his or her spouse had <span class=Underline>chosen</span><i> </i>not to insure the automobile. He says that a vehicle taken without consent
    of the owner is an “uninsured automobile”. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge began his analysis by reviewing <em>Fosker v. Thorpe</em> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 753 (S.C.), which arose from a r. 21 motion. In <em>Fosker</em>,
    a thief, in the course of stealing the plaintiff’s car, struck the plaintiff
    with her own car. Applying the principles of statutory interpretation, Quinn J.
    held, at para. 29, that the wording of s. 265(2) of the <em>Insurance Act</em>,
    s. 5.1.2 of O.A.P. No.  1 and OPCF 44R is clear and unambiguous. Because the
    car was owned by the insured plaintiff, it was not an “uninsured automobile”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge disagreed with Quinn J.’s conclusion that s. 265(2) is
    clear and unambiguous. And, applying principles of contractual, rather than
    statutory, interpretation to the Endorsement, he concluded that those
    provisions were also ambiguous and should accordingly be construed against Jevco
    and given an “interpretation that spreads, rather than closes, the safety net”: 
    para. 30. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 34, the motion judge wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I therefore conclude that vehicles owned by the insured or
    spouse, if insured, are “uninsured automobiles” when taken without consent.
    Therefore, I conclude that Ms. Ketash, if she took the vehicle without consent,
    is an “inadequately insured motorist” under the [Endorsement].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is this conclusion – which Jevco characterizes as a binding
    determination of law – that Jevco seeks to appeal to this court. The motion
    judge concluded para. 34 with the following sentence: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>As such, I conclude that there <span class=Underline>may</span> be coverage and Jevco’s motion for summary judgment is dismissed. [Emphasis

  <p class=CQuote>¶12.41 In general terms, the policy underlying the distinction

    wrote this, at pp. 623-24 and 625-26:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>When parties argue whether orders of this nature are final or
    interlocutory, they appear to lose sight of the fact that there is a remedy
    where the order is interlocutory, although admittedly, it is to another court
    and requires leave. It was apparent from the argument in this appeal that the
    appellant's real concern was not where to appeal the motions court judge's
    order allowing the action to proceed to trial. Rather, the real concern was
    that, unless overturned on appeal, the findings underlying this order would be
    binding on the judge who ultimately tried the action, either because the
    findings are <em>res judicat</em>a or raise <em><span style='font-style:normal'>issue
    estoppel</span></em>, or because, in this particular case, they are so detailed
    and incisive that the trial judge, even if he or she does not feel obliged in
    law to follow them, will show them great deference and adopt them as
    persuasive. The latter consideration may be a sound reason for allowing leave
    to appeal, but it is of no concern to this court. As to <em>res judicata</em> or <em><span style='font-style:normal'>issue estoppel</span></em> in the
    context of a motion for summary judgment that is dismissed, I do not think that
    the motions court judge's reasons should be taken as anything more than his
    explanation for finding that there is a genuine issue for trial. It is the
    finding that there is a genuine issue for trial that is <em>res judicata</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Conceptually, it may be difficult to accept that where a
    plaintiff or defendant moves for summary judgment and succeeds, the appeal from
    that summary judgment is to this court as of right whereas if the moving party
    fails to obtain a summary judgment, the order dismissing the motion is to the
    Divisional Court, and only with leave of that court. However, the distinction
    has a long tradition in the law. The summary judgment finally determines the
    issue or issues between the parties and gives rise to a plea of <em>res
    judicata</em> in subsequent proceedings on the same issue or issues. An order
    dismissing a motion for summary judgment, on the other hand, determines only
    that there is a genuine issue for trial and the issue or issues have not been
    finally resolved.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court reiterated in <em>Ashak v. Ontario (Director, Family
    Responsibility Office)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2013
    ONCA 375, 115 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 7, that, in general, an order dismissing
    a motion for summary judgment is not a final order because a decision under r.
    20 determines only that a genuine issue requiring a trial exists.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Purported findings of fact by a motion judge who dismisses a summary
    judgment motion do not have binding effect in the subsequent proceeding unless
    the motion judge invokes her power under r. 20.05(1) to make an order
    specifying what material facts are not in dispute – a power that exists where
    summary judgment is refused or is granted only in part. As this court stated in <em>Ashak</em>, where a motion judge proposes to do so, she should specifically
    say so, and the order should refer to r. 20.05(1): para. 8, citing <em>Leone v.
    University of Toronto Outing Club</em>, 2007 ONCA 323, at para. 3.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same principle applies in the case of questions of law. At paras.11
    and 13 of <em>Ashak</em>, the court wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Like the court in <em>Leone</em>, it is our view that, if a

    power under rule 20.04(4)<sup>[</sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a><sup>]</sup> to make a binding determination of law, the motion judge should specifically
    invoke the rule, and reference to the rule, as well as the legal determination
    made, should form part of the formal order. In our opinion, the issue of
    whether an order is final or interlocutory should not turn on the forcefulness
    of the reasons for the conclusion….</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In our view, in most instances, the content of the formal order
    is integral to determining what has been decided against a party in a fashion
    that is binding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Ashak</em> distinguished <em>Almrei v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>,
    2011 ONCA 779, 345 D.L.R. (4th) 475, in which an order dismissing a summary
    judgment motion was found to be a final order, and makes clear that <em>Almrei</em> “should not be viewed as establishing a general principle that the question of
    whether an order dismissing a motion for summary judgment is final can be
    determined based on a motion judge’s reasons”: para.  15.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Almrei had been held in custody for many years on two successive
    security certificates issued under the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection
    Act</em>, S.C. 2001, c. 27. Ultimately, after a lengthy hearing, parts of which
    were held <i>in camera</i> or <i>ex parte</i>, the second security certificate
    was quashed by Mosely J. Mr. Almrei subsequently commenced a civil action against
    Canada for, among other things, negligent investigation, false imprisonment and
    various <em>Charter</em> breaches. He brought a motion for partial summary
    judgment, arguing that <em><span style='font-style:normal'>issue estoppel</span></em> applied and the parties were bound by the findings made by Mosley J. The motion
    judge dismissed Mr. Almrei’s motion, explaining that Mr. Almrei sought to
    invoke the doctrine of <em><span style='font-style:normal'>issue estoppel</span></em> as a sword to obtain summary judgment, rather than as a shield or defence to
    preclude litigation on matters already decided between the parties, and that the
    test for <em><span style='font-style:normal'>issue estoppel</span></em> had not
    been met.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court dismissed the Attorney General of Canada’s motion to quash
    Mr. Almrei’s appeal to this court. At para. 4 of its analysis, this court noted
    that the hearing before Mosely J. involved hearing evidence that Mr. Almrei might
    never be in a position to call or even access. Thus, depriving Mr. Almrei of
    the ability to use the findings of fact by Mosely J. could deprive Mr. Almrei
    of substantive rights. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  At para. 7, this court concluded:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Mr. Almrei] singled out for resolution the question of use of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>issue estoppel</span></em>. A finding that <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>issue estoppel</span></em> is not available is a
    final determination of that issue of law. The decision of the motion judge has
    arguably deprived the appellant of a substantive right that could have been
    entirely determinative of the Attorney General's liability…. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Ashak</em>, the court provided three reasons why <em>Almrei</em> should not be taken as establishing a general principle that where a judge
    purports to make a legal determination in reasons dismissing a summary judgment
    motion those determinations should be treated as binding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, Mr. Almrei had formally singled out the precise legal issue to be
    decided. Unlike in <em>Ashak</em>, the precise scope of the point of law
    determined by the motion judge was clear. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the determination on the question of issue estoppel potentially
    deprived Mr. Almrei of the ability to prove his case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, Canada – the party that moved to quash the appeal on the basis
    that the order was interlocutory – maintained that the question of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>issue estoppel</span></em> was <em>res judicata</em>.
     </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By distinguishing <em>Almre</em><i>i</i> in that manner, the court left
    open the possibility that, in circumstances paralleling those in <em>Almrei</em>,
    a legal determination could be found to be binding, even if not included in the
    formal order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology v. AU Optronics
    Corp.</em>, 2015 ONCA 808, the motion judge made several determinations of law
    in the course of dismissing the defendants’ motion for summary judgment. When
    the defendants appealed to this court, the plaintiff moved to quash their
    appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  In the course of its submissions, the
    plaintiff conceded that “nothing in the order sought to be appealed, or in the
    reasons of the motion judge in support of that order, precludes the [defendants]
    in any way from advancing at trial their arguments regarding s. 36(4) of the <em>Competition
    Act</em> or abuse of process as substantive defences or otherwise.” In light of
    that concession, this court quashed the appeal in a three-paragraph endorsement
    on the basis that the order below was interlocutory, and not final.<span

  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis and synthesis</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the issue of whether an automobile that has been taken
    without the consent of the owner is excluded from the definition of “uninsured
    automobile” by reason of the fact that it is owned by or registered in the name
    of the insured or his or her spouse is not <em>res judicata</em>, and that the
    motion judge’s order dismissing Jevco’s summary judgment motion is therefore
    not a final order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the formal order in this case was issued nearly three years after <em>Ashak</em> was decided, it simply provides that “the motion is dismissed” and orders costs
    of the motion payable to Mr. Skunk. And – in face of <em>Ashak</em> – the motion
    judge did not invoke r. 20.04(4) and declare that an automobile that has been
    taken without the consent of the owner is not excluded from the definition of
    “uninsured automobile” by reason of the fact that it is owned by or registered
    in the name of the insured or his or her spouse. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor is it clear from examining the motion judge’s reasons, as Jevco
    urged this court to do, that the order under appeal is final. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite expressing a “conclusion” about the interpretation of the Endorsement
    in his reasons, the motion judge simply determined that there “may” be
    coverage. As I explain below, it is not clear that the motion judge did not
    simply conclude that there was a genuine issue for trial as to whether or not Mr.
    Skunk is entitled to coverage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jevco argues that the motion judge used the word “may” in his reasons
    because, albeit mistakenly, he thought that the issue of whether or not the
    vehicle was driven without the consent of Ms. Skunk would be a live issue at
    trial. Jevco points to the motion judge’s use of the word “if” at para. 34: “Therefore,
    I conclude that Ms. Ketash, <span class=Underline>if</span> she took the
    vehicle without consent, is an ‘inadequately insured motorist’” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 3 of his reasons, the motion judge wrote that “the vehicle … became
    uninsured when it was taken without consent by the defendant Ketash.” However,
    after reciting the facts as recounted in Mr. Skunk’s factum, the motion judge
    wrote the following phrase, at para. 11, giving rise to Jevco’s argument:  “On
    these facts, it is not clear that there is a lack of consent.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have said, Mr. Skunk’s position is that Ms. Ketash drove Ms.
    Skunk’s vehicle without her consent. Lack of consent is necessary if Mr. Skunk
    is to succeed in his claim for coverage on the basis that the vehicle is an
    uninsured automobile. And Jevco concedes this element: it specifically pleads
    in its statement of defence that Mr. Skunk took his spouse’s vehicle without
    her consent. Thus, as the parties submit, the question of consent is not an
    issue for trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jevco’s explanation of why the motion judge used the words “if” and
    “may” is plausible. However, the motion judge’s reasoning is unclear.  Another
    plausible explanation is that the motion judge understood that the question of
    consent was not an issue for trial and used the word “if” because he did not
    want to appear to endorse what the parties had agreed amounted to lack of consent. 
    And, if that interpretation is accepted, then “may” is consistent with his
    determining only that there is a genuine issue for trial.  Given this ambiguity
    in the motion judge’s reasons, his conclusions should not be taken as anything
    more than his explanation for finding that there is a genuine issue for trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While not determinative in and of itself, Mr. Skunk’s concession is
    consistent with my view that the order under appeal is interlocutory. Despite
    the fact that it is against his interests at trial, he conceded that the issue of
    whether the vehicle is an “uninsured automobile” is not <em>res judicata</em> and that the trial judge is free to follow <em>Fosker</em> and conclude that it
    is not an “uninsured automobile” because it is owned by his spouse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The debate about the interpretation of the motion judge’s reasons
    highlights the wisdom of <em>Ashak</em>. Had the motion judge specified that he
    was making a determination of law that was binding on the trial judge, or if
    the parties had prepared a form of order in accordance with <em>Ashak</em>,
    this court would have had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Jevco – like Mr.
    Almrei – singled out a specific legal issue to be determined, and the issue –
    if resolved in Jevco’s favour – would have been determinative of the action.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To understand the parties’ submissions on whether the motion judge had
    made a binding determination of law, it was necessary to delve into the substance
    of the appeal.  Having done so, the temptation is to find jurisdiction and rule
    on the merits, which would avoid the need for a further attendance by the parties.
    The efficiencies of time and cost for the parties are obvious. However, it
    would take away from the force of this court’s directive in <em>Ashak</em> and
    increase the considerable uncertainty about when an appeal of the dismissal of
    a summary judgment motion lies to this court. That confusion results in costs
    and inefficiencies – to both litigants and the court system – on a wider scale.
    Post-<em>Hryniak</em>, the volume of summary judgment motions, and,
    anecdotally, the volume of appeals from the dismissal of summary judgment
    motions, have increased. Greater clarity is needed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In an attempt to provide greater clarity, I would summarize the effect
    of this court’s jurisprudence as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The general rule is that an order dismissing a motion for summary
    judgment is an interlocutory, and not a final, order. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a
    party argues that the motion judge made a final, binding determination of law
    that disposes of the substantive rights of one of the parties (“Binding Legal
    Determination”) in dismissing the summary judgment motion, then this court will
    consider whether the motion judge’s order invokes r. 20.04(4) and references
    the legal determination that the party argues is a Binding Legal Determination. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast>3. If
    the order does not invoke r. 20.04(4) and reference the legal determination
    that the party argues is a Binding Legal Determination, the court will usually consider
    whether the precise scope of the point of law determined by the motion judge is
    clear and whether it is clear that the motion judge intended that her determination
    be binding on the parties at trial. In this case, it was not clear that the
    motion judge intended his determination to be binding on the parties at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make two additional points. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, consistent with this court’s directions in <i>Ashak</i>, in the
    absence of an express indication by the motion judge that her determination is
    to be binding on the parties at trial, it should be presumed that in expressing
    a conclusion on a point of law when dismissing a summary judgment motion she is
    simply explaining why she concluded that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial,
    and did not intend her determination to be binding on the parties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, while this court may take into account a party’s concession that
    an issue is or is not <em>res judicata</em> in determining whether an order is
    final or interlocutory, a concession cannot confer or deprive the court of
    jurisdiction. I do not read either <em>Almrei</em>, <em>Ashak</em> or <em>Fanshawe</em> as suggesting otherwise. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The daily workload of Superior Court motion judges is heavy. Nonetheless,
    when dismissing a summary judgment motion, I would urge them to specifically
    consider to what extent they are making determinations of law intended to be
    binding on the parties at trial, and, if they are intending to make such
