  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>By the Court:</b></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sixdion Inc. (“Sixdion”) describes itself as an
    Aboriginal IT company. Its goal was to market comprehensive IT systems to
    Aboriginal communities. Computer Associates International Inc. (“CA”)<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> carries on the business of developing, manufacturing and licensing proprietary
    computer software programs in the U.S. and elsewhere. It has a subsidiary that
    markets and sells CA’s products in Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2004, Sixdion believed that it had a contract
    with CA. Sixdion claimed that CA breached the contract, resulting in Sixdion's
    filing for bankruptcy in 2005.  Rougemount Capital Inc. (“Rougemount”), a
    former Sixdion creditor, purchased the action against CA from Sixdion’s trustee
    for $5,000. It is common ground that this entitles Rougemount to 60% of any
    damages assessed to have been incurred by Sixdion as a result of CA’s breach of
    their agreement. Rougemount claimed damages suffered by Sixdion of $20 million
    - $54 million as a result.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that there was a contract
    that CA breached and awarded $11 million in damages. CA appeals and argues that
    the trial judge made fatal errors in reaching her decision on both the issue of
    the validity and nature of the contract and in her assessment of damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rougemount, on the other hand, stresses that
    this action is not just about the destruction of Sixdion, which flowed from
    CA's breach of contract. Rather, it argues that it is also about the loss of a
    formidable opportunity for both Sixdion and CA, as a direct result of CA's
    failure to fulfill its agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixdion’s business and development</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sixdion was incorporated on February 22, 1996.
    At all material times it had three primary shareholders: Murray Dion (“M.
    Dion”), Lewis Staats (“Staats”), and Leo Dion (“L. Dion”). Sixdion was an
    Aboriginal company<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a> involved in the information and communications technology business. Initially
    Sixdion provided “low-tech” services. However, Sixdion’s principals testified
    (and the trial judge accepted) that the company was constantly developing its
    business model and trying to provide more sophisticated services and products.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2004, Sixdion was at a crossroads. Its
    principals believed that it could achieve commercial success by capitalizing on
    the company’s status as an Aboriginal company (in relation to government
    procurement contracts) and by providing technology services for Canadian (and
    eventually international) indigenous populations. However, in order to exploit
    that potential, it needed capital investment and partnership with more
    established companies. It is in this context that Sixdion began to interact
    with CA.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Negotiations and contract between Sixdion and CA</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Representatives of CA-Canada approached Sixdion
    in March 2004. They were interested in Sixdion because working with an
    Aboriginal company would make it easier for CA to benefit from government
    projects and procurement. Initially, CA wanted a marketing agreement wherein
    Sixdion would re-sell CA products. However, Sixdion insisted on an agreement in
    which CA would purchase some equity in Sixdion and be an active partner in its
    business.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge provided a lot of detail about
    the negotiations between the two companies over the summer of 2004. We
    highlight the following salient details: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst style='
line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CA-Canada was enthusiastic about the deal but CA-International
    (specifically the head office in New York) was not; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle style='
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chris Devlin (“Devlin”) was a significant actor in these
    negotiations and CA’s main representative to Sixdion; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle style='
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Devlin told Sixdion’s principals that Gary Quinn (“Quinn”),
    Executive Vice-President at CA-International, had the authority to approve the
    deal; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle style='
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Quinn approved the deal and, on July 30, 2004, Devlin told M.
    Dion that Quinn had approved the deal; and, </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast style='
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Devlin sent a letter dated August 11, 2004, which stated: “I am
    pleased to commit our partnership based on your Term Sheet delivered to me on
    May 6 of this year. In addition to capital we will invest technical and
    architectural resources to ensure that Sixdion can deliver the industries [sic]
    best practices in infrastructure management”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The deal comprised the following elements:
    Sixdion would receive $1.5 million from CA; CA would get share warrants that
    would provide the option to obtain up to ten percent of Sixdion’s shares;
    Sixdion would cooperate in selling CA products to the federal government,
    allowing CA to benefit from Aboriginal procurement initiatives; and CA would
    become a partner of Sixdion, finding other investors and businesses, and
    helping Sixdion develop the capacity to achieve its business objectives.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Breach of agreement</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>CA did not honour its agreement with Sixdion. It
    never made the payments that it had promised. Officials at CA-International
    began to question Quinn’s decision to approve the transaction and in October
    2004, Jeff Clarke, Chief Operating Officer at CA-International, told Quinn to
    “kill” the deal. CA then informed Sixdion that it would not be continuing with
    their arrangement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made a number of findings about
    the period between July 2004 (when Quinn approved the proposed deal) and
    November 2004 (when the deal was killed). We note the following: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst style='
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sixdion hired additional staff and incurred additional expenses
    on the understanding that it would be receiving $1.5 million from CA and would
    be expanding its business; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle style='
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>People from CA worked with Sixdion, acting as if they had reached
    a deal. Devlin volunteered to look for other investors. A CA employee worked
    with Sixdion to create and implement a business plan for the partnership; and, </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast style='
line-height:150%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Quinn and Devlin believed that they had the authority to commit
    to the deal and believed that their agreement was sufficient to commit CA to
    the contract. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted, CA-International decided to “kill” the
    deal. Sixdion, which had been facing financial difficulties this entire time,
    collapsed. It filed an assignment into bankruptcy in February 2005.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>TRIAL JUDGE’S DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As mentioned earlier, Rougemount commenced the
    action, alleging breach of contract and seeking damages suffered by Sixdion of
    $20 million to $54 million as a result.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>CA defended Rougemount’s claim and argued that:
    (a) there was no binding contract between CA and Sixdion; (b) CA could rescind
    any contract because it was obtained through misrepresentations; and (c)
    Sixdion did not suffer any damages. The trial judge rejected CA’s position. She
    concluded that there was a valid contract and that Sixdion had not made any
    misrepresentations. She awarded $11 million in damages, along with prejudgment
    interest.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sixdion and CA entered into a binding contract </span></h5>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Quinn had the authority to approve the proposed contract</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>CA argued that Quinn and Devlin did not have the
    requisite authority to approve the proposed contract. They primarily relied on
    the evidence of George Cox (“Cox”), an employee at CA’s business development
    group, who stated that any “equity” transaction needed the approval of
    CA-International’s business development team and that Quinn could not approve
    an “equity” transaction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, Rougemount relied on the fact
    that Devlin (who testified) believed that Quinn had the authority, and
    communications from the time of the negotiation showed that both Devlin and
    Quinn thought that the latter could approve the deal as a “marketing expense”
    or a “marketing transaction”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge concluded that Quinn had the
    requisite authority. She concluded that the proposed deal was a marketing deal
    and that, therefore, Quinn had the authority to pay the $1.5 million price out
    of his marketing budget. Furthermore, she concluded that Devlin and Quinn had
    obtained the requisite approvals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the alternative, the trial judge concluded
    that Quinn and Devlin had apparent authority to bind CA. CA held out Devlin and
    Quinn as having the requisite authority and did nothing to suggest to Sixdion
    that they were not authorized to make the deal. She found that the principals
    of Sixdion reasonably relied on what Devlin told them in regard to Quinn and
    Devlin's authority.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-US>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Remaining issues regarding the contract</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The remaining issues regarding the validity of
    the contract are not relevant on appeal. We summarize them briefly. The trial
    judge concluded that the parties had settled all essential terms of the
    contract by August 11, 2004, and the contract was not conditional on any due
    diligence, obtaining a second investor, or amalgamation. The trial judge also

    several ways: (i) CA wrongly informed one of Sixdion’s service providers
    (Telesat) that there was no contract, due to which Telesat insisted on more
    rigorous repayment terms, contributing to Sixdion’s demise; (ii) Devlin
    discouraged Sixdion from pursuing certain other investors, particularly

    Rougemount was seeking damages on the basis that, had CA kept to its bargain,
    Sixdion would have achieved all of the goals set out in the five-year business
    plan Sixdion had developed with CA. Therefore, the issue ended up being whether
    Rougemount was entitled to damages on the basis that CA deprived Sixdion of the
    opportunity to achieve this potential business plan (the “Business Plan”).</span></p>

    of appeal. First, it argues the trial judge wrongly concluded that the proposed
    deal was a “marketing deal” and not an “equity transaction”. It points out

    the discounted cash flow analysis prepared by the appellant’s expert. The
    appellant’s expert, Mr. Marino, opined that if the trial judge were to conclude
    that the forecasts were sufficiently reliable, the correct valuation
    methodology would involve a discounted cash flow analysis as set out in his
    calculations. Using a discounted cash flow approach and applying a venture capital
    discount rate of between 40% and 70% to Mr. Pittman’s averages, Mr. Marino
    estimated that Rougemount’s resulting share of Sixdion’s losses as at August 1,
    2004, would be in a range of approximately between $0 and $2.6 milliion.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s expert, Mr. Pittman, confirmed
    that had he used August 2004, the date of breach, for the assessment of
    damages, the discounted cash flow approach applied by Mr. Marino would have
    been correct. He also testified in cross-examination that when venture
    capitalists are looking at a business with no prior history of revenue and are
    basing their assessment of a forecast, they would be looking at discount rates
    in the range of 40% to 100%.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, although there were some obvious
    issues concerning the reliability estimates contained in the Business Plan, it
    was open to the trial judge, in the absence of better or other evidence, to use
    the Business Plan as a basis for her assessment of damages. The trial judge’s
    reasons demonstrate that she was well aware of the Business Plan’s
    deficiencies.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We agree that the Business Plan was subject to
    some inflationary puffery, given that it was an optimistic presentation of what
    the parties hoped would happen in the future in order to obtain CA head office’s
    agreement to the investment. However, we also agree with the trial judge’s
    observation that it was the product of Sixdion and CA and, subject to
    appropriate tweaking and discounts, was the only solid financial information
    that was available for the purposes of estimating Sixdion’s future loss of
    opportunity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That said, we are also of the view that the
    trial judge erred in failing to apply a discounted cash flow analysis as of the
    date of the breach. This meant that the risk and unpredictability of Sixdion’s
    future cash flows were ignored until a point many years after the date of
    breach and resulted in an artificial inflation of the damages. The approach
    followed by the trial judge failed to take into account the cumulative risk
    that the profits set out in the Business Plan might not materialize.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As such, even had CA fulfilled its contractual
    obligations, the new business would have had significant start-up costs,
    including the payment of significant past liabilities to Sixdion’s creditors,
    and the enormous revenues predicted towards the end of the Business Plan would
    have taken some time to generate.  Accordingly, placing Sixdion in the position
    that it would have occupied had the contract been performed meant taking into
    account the costs as well as the benefits of the new business venture. The
    trial judge’s approach failed to do this.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We conclude that the discounted cash flow
    analysis prepared by the appellant’s expert, calculating damages as of the date
    of breach in 2004, would be the fairest method to assess Sixdion’s damages. We
    also agree that Sixdion’s unstable financial past and condition, as well as the
    uncertainty of the new venture, justifies a substantial discount.  </span></p>

    of these damages is not an exact science, we are of the view that the mid-range
    of Mr. Marino’s calculation would allow for the fairest assessment of damages
    in all the particular circumstances of the present case.  This would result in
    damages of $1,300,000.</span></p>
