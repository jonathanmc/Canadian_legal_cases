  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on December 03,
    2014 by Justice G.W. Tranmer of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without
    a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>By the Court:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a five-day judge alone trial, the appellant was convicted of
    sexual assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching involving
    A.B., his former common-law stepson, over a seven year period. He was also
    convicted of one count of assault involving his former common law spouse, S.B.,
    and one count of breach of recognizance. He appeals his convictions, with
    particular focus on the offences involving his former stepson, arguing that the
    trial judge’s analysis of the credibility and reliability of A.B.’s evidence
    was flawed. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Facts </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In June 2003 the appellant moved into a home with S.B. and her son A.B.,
    born in 2000, and S.B.’s daughter. He formed a strong relationship with A.B.,
    who eventually grew to consider the appellant his father. The family resided at
    several residences over the next several years. The appellant’s son from a
    previous relationship moved into the household in 2007, and the appellant and S.B.
    had a child together, born in 2004. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2012 the appellant moved out of the home he had shared with S.B.,
    A.B. and the other children, having started a relationship with another woman,
    the mother of a friend of A.B. A.B. was very upset over the appellant’s
    departure, as was S.B. Over the next several months A.B. sent the appellant
    several angry text messages, expressing his anger at the appellant for having
    abandoned the family. S.B. posted Facebook messages expressing her anger at the
    appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 3, 2013 S.B. reported to the police that the appellant had spat
    on her and punched her repeatedly in the head when he had come to her house
    earlier that day to pick up the children. The appellant was arrested and
    charged with assault. On June 12, 2013 S.B. reported to a Children’s Aid Society
    worker that A.B. had alleged earlier that day that the appellant had sexually
    abused him. This was the first time A.B. had made such allegations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 26, 2013 A.B. gave a video-taped statement to the police
    alleging acts of sexual touching, as well as oral and anal sex. The appellant
    was charged with the offences involving the alleged sexual abuse of A.B. on
    July 2, 2013.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Trial</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.B.’s police statement was admitted into evidence pursuant to s.715.1
    of the <em>Criminal Code. </em>A.B. testified and adopted his statement. However,
    in A.B.’s trial evidence, the allegations of sexual abuse were more detailed
    and more extensive than the allegations he had made in his police statement or
    at the preliminary inquiry. At trial, A.B. testified that from the age of six,
    he was sexually abused by the appellant hundreds of times at multiple residences
    over a span of seven years. The acts of alleged abuse included sexual touching,
    oral and anal sex performed on A.B. and, at the appellant’s direction,
    performed by A.B. on the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify at trial, nor did he call any witnesses.
    Defence counsel submitted that reasonable doubt was apparent in the
    inconsistencies in A.B.’s testimony, the implausibility of the story told by A.B.,
    the clear and demonstrated animus of the complainants towards the appellant,
    and their motive to fabricate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave relatively lengthy oral reasons for convicting the
    appellant. No issue is taken with the trial judge’s statement of the applicable
    legal principles, including the presumption of innocence, reasonable doubt and
    the analysis from <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R 742. The trial judge
    also considered <em>R. v. MG</em> (1994), 93 C.C.C (3d) 347 (Ont. CA), the case
    principally relied upon by the appellant, and provided an error-free analysis
    of how to assess and weigh inconsistencies in the evidence of a witness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons, the trial judge addressed several inconsistencies
    apparent in A.B.’s testimony. He also recognized that the factor of a
    motivation to fabricate was present, and noted that the defence was arguing
    both collusion and that the allegations made by A.B. were not plausible.
    However, the trial judge concluded that the defence submissions on these points
    were not sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about whether the alleged
    sexual abuse had taken place. He found that A.B. was a credible and reliable
    witness in regard to the core of the allegations he had made, and accepted that
    the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the truth of the allegations.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises the following issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst style='line-height:150%'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial

style='line-height:150%'>Did the trial judge fail to properly analyze the
    motive of A.B. and S.B. to fabricate the allegations?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle style='line-height:150%'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial
    judge fail to properly analyze the possibility of collusion between the
    complainants?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle style='line-height:150%'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial
    judge fail to address the issue of the implausibility of A.B.’s allegations?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle style='line-height:150%'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial
    judge over-emphasize A.B.’s ability to recall extraneous details?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast style='line-height:150%'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial
    judge shift the burden of proof to the defence to prove the allegations did not
    occur?</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em>1. Did the trial judge fail to consider material
    inconsistencies in A.B.’s evidence?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case plainly turned upon the credibility and reliability of A.B.’s evidence. We
    need not belabour the obvious: credibility is a matter for the trial judge
    whose findings attract deference in this court absent an error in principle or
    a material misapprehension of evidence: <em>R v. W.(R.), </em>[1992] 2 S.C.R.
    122, at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that by the time of trial, A.B.’s allegations were more detailed,
    elaborate, and extensive than those he gave in his initial police statement and
    at the preliminary inquiry. On appeal, counsel points to a number of
    inconsistencies and argues that the trial judge’s failure to specifically
    address all of them taints his finding that A.B. was a reliable and credible
    witness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept that submission for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that he did consider the inconsistencies
    between A.B.’s police statement and his in-court testimony, and he explained
    why he did not consider those inconsistencies to be fatal to A.B.’s credibility
    and reliability. When asked in cross-examination why he had not given the
    police all the details in his video statement, A.B. replied: “I was embarrassed
    and…It was gross. I didn’t want to tell somebody I didn’t know stuff that
    happened to me. I barely even wanted to tell my mother”. The trial judge viewed
    the video recording of A.B.’s police statement, and observed that when giving
    his statement to the police, A.B. “was shy, and afraid” and demonstrated a “lack
    of understanding and sophistication”. By the time of trial, the complainant was
    a teenager and more at ease in explaining what had happened.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    we agree with the respondent that the trial judge’s reasons were essentially
    responsive to the submissions made by the appellant’s trial counsel. Trial
    counsel placed particular emphasis on the fact that A.B. could not recall the
    details of the first incident of abuse when he gave his police statement. The
    trial judge dealt with that argument, and with the others made by trial
    counsel. Many, if not most, of the inconsistencies now raised on appeal were
    not mentioned by trial counsel. In our view, it is entirely understandable why
    the trial judge focused on the inconsistencies alleged by trial counsel and did
    not find it necessary to address in his reasons other apparent inconsistencies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that when the trial judge’s reasons are read in the context of
    the submissions he heard, they reveal that the trial judge gave adequate
    consideration to the essential point, namely, whether there was an explanation
    for the manner in which A.B.’s allegations changed from the time he gave his
    police statement until he testified at trial. The trial judge concluded there
    was such an explanation, namely, A.B.’s age, shyness and immaturity at the time
    he gave his police statement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><em>2. Did
    the trial judge fail to properly analyze the motive of A.B. and S.B. to
    fabricate the allegations? </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to pay adequate attention to the
    evidence of A.B. being upset and disappointed when the appellant moved out of
    the family residence, evidence the appellant contends revealed A.B. had a
    motive to fabricate.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree with that submission. The trial judge specifically referred to the
    evidence “which clearly demonstrate [A.B.’s] anger and upset at what he
    perceived to be the accused abandoning him and his family in favour” of his
    friend and his friend’s mother. The trial judge also specifically noted that
    the complainant’s mother had demonstrated considerable anger and upset and had
    expressed a desire for revenge against the appellant. The trial judge stated “I
    take this into consideration in my overall assessment of the credibility and
    reliability of their evidence”. However, having taken the evidence of motive to
    fabricate into account, the trial judge concluded that he found A.B.’s evidence
    to be nonetheless credible and reliable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge was entitled to make his own assessment of the
    significance to be attached to the motive to fabricate which he fully
    recognized and, in the absence of any material misapprehension of the evidence
    on the point, we fail to see how this Court could interfere with his findings. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><em>3. Did
    the trial judge fail to properly analyze the possibility of collusion between
    the complainants?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge specifically addressed the possibility of collusion between A.B.
    and S.B., and provided adequate reason for concluding that there had been no
    collusion. In particular, the trial judge observed that while the complainant
    and his mother had the opportunity to collude, S.B. gave no evidence to
    corroborate A.B.’s allegations of abuse. To the contrary, she testified that
    the accused had been a good father to the children, and that she had no reason
    to suspect any misconduct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no merit in this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><em>4. Did
    the trial judge fail to address the issue of the implausibility of A.B.’s
    allegations?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal the appellant places considerable emphasis on what he alleges to be the
    implausibility of A.B.’s allegations. He submits that it is improbable that the
    appellant could have committed these offences without anyone in the household
    noticing; that it is improbable that a child between six and 12 years old would
    not have suffered physical injury from having been repeatedly penetrated anally;
    and that despite his allegations of anal sex, A.B. never mentioned the presence
    of feces.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the following passage from the reasons reveals that the
    trial judge erred by improperly putting the claim of implausibility to one
    side. The trial judge listed several points which the defence said pointed to
    implausibility, namely, that: lubricant was not used; there was no evidence of
    grooming; there was no evidence of physical injury; a six-year-old would be
    unable to have anal sex on the appellant, and; the lack of mention of feces.
    The trial judge then stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The accused is required to prove nothing whatsoever in this
    case, but neither are any of these four points essential elements of the offences
    charged upon which the Crown has the onus of proving beyond a reasonable doubt.
    I do not consider that these four points bear on my assessment of the
    credibility and reliability of the complainant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that this passage reveals that the trial judge failed to
    consider the defence implausibility argument simply because it rested on points
    that were not essential elements of the offence the Crown was required to
    prove. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. We are satisfied that when read in the light of the entire record and
    submissions that were made to the trial judge, the passage reveals no such
    error. The trial judge recognized that when assessing the plausibility of A.B.’s
    allegations, he had to take into account the fact that he was faced with the
    difficult task of assessing the evidence of a child regarding acts with which
    no child would be familiar. While A.B. testified that the appellant performed
    anal sex on him and that he had performed anal sex on the appellant, neither
    the Crown nor defence questioned A.B. as to the degree of penetration that
    either he or the appellant were able to achieve. As Crown counsel pointed out
    in his submissions, what a young child perceived to be penetration could well
    be something well short of full penetration. Crown counsel also pointed out
    that neither party called evidence on the likelihood of physical injury or of
    the presence of feces. The trial judge made it clear during argument that the
    defence had no burden. However, in the absence of some evidence on the point,
    he was not prepared to draw any conclusions from A.B.’s failure to mention
    anything about feces or injuries. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge was entitled to refuse to draw the negative
    inferences advanced by the defence that were reasonably based on the evidence
    that had been led.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    fairly read in the overall context of this case, the passage indicates nothing
    more than that the trial judge regarded aspects of the appellant’s
    implausibility argument as speculative and unsupported by the record. We are
    not persuaded that this isolated passage in the trial judge’s lengthy oral
    reasons for judgment that fully canvassed the evidence demonstrates that the
    trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the defence argument of
    implausibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><em>5. Did
    the trial judge over emphasize A.B.’s ability to recall extraneous details?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did refer to A.B.’s ability to recall certain details as to time,
    place and circumstances, but we do not agree that he erred in this regard. This
    was only one factor in his credibility assessment, and at trial defence counsel
    attacked alleged inconsistencies in A.B.’s evidence regarding surrounding
    details. The trial judge did not err in responding to those submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><em>6. Did
    the trial judge shift the burden of proof to the defence to prove the
    allegations did not occur?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge shifted the burden of proof to the defence.
    The passage relied upon by the appellant to support this contention corresponds
    with the second step of the <em>W.(D.)</em> analysis. It was preceded by a
    proper explanation of <em>W.(D.),</em> and immediately followed by a clear
    statement that the trial judge found that the Crown had proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the alleged incidents of repeated sexual abuse described
    by the complainant did occur.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
