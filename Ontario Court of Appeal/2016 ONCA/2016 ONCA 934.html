  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice W. Danial Newton of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated January 19, 2016, with reasons reported at
    2016 ONSC 457.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>van Rensburg J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central question in this appeal is whether the court has
    jurisdiction to grant relief from a deemed forfeiture occurring under s. 380(6)
    of the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>, S.O. 2001, c. 25 (the “Act”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, a not-for-profit corporation supporting Poplar Point
    First Nation Band and its members, was the registered owner of a property that
    was sold by the City of Thunder Bay (the “Municipality”) in a municipal tax
    sale. After recovering $5,843.11 in tax arrears and additional associated
    costs, the Municipality paid into court the surplus (an amount exceeding
    $76,000). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 380(4) of the Act, the appellant had one year from the
    date of payment of the surplus into court to bring an application for payment
    out of court. Pursuant to s. 380(6), one year after payment in, the monies were
    deemed to be forfeited to the Municipality. The appellant applied to the court
    three weeks after the one year deadline. In response to the appellant’s
    application, the Municipality brought a counter-application, seeking payment
    out of court of the monies pursuant to s. 380(7) of the Act. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge, after setting out the chronology of what had
    occurred, and the steps the Municipality had taken, all in accordance with the
    Act, considered whether to grant the appellant relief from forfeiture under s.
    98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 or under s. 5(1)
    of the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.13.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> After considering the contradictory case authority, the application judge
    dismissed the appellant’s application on the basis that he was not empowered to
    grant relief from forfeiture under either statute. He said he would have
    granted relief from forfeiture, if he had the jurisdiction to do so. He granted
    the Municipality’s application for payment out of court. Neither party sought
    costs, and none were awarded.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals, arguing that the application judge erred in
    concluding that he did not have jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture.
    The respondent says that the application judge was correct on this point, and
    in any event that relief from forfeiture is not warranted on the evidence in
    this case.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Briefly, I conclude that there is jurisdiction in the Superior Court
    under s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act </em>in proceedings under s. 380
    of the Act to grant relief from the deemed forfeiture arising under s. 380(6).
    Since the Act does not expressly, or by necessary implication, exclude the
    court’s general power to grant relief from forfeiture in civil proceedings, and
    the forfeiture is not imposed as a penalty for breach of any requirement of the
    statute, such relief may be available. In this case, to grant relief would not
    undermine the purpose of the Act, or interfere with the finality and certainty
    of the municipal tax sale scheme. Resort to s. 5(1) of the <em>Fines and
    Forfeitures Act </em>is unnecessary and it is doubtful that this statute would
    apply. Finally, consistent with the application judge’s assessment of the facts
    and the equities, I conclude that relief from forfeiture is warranted in this
    case. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relevant Facts and Statutory Provisions  </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the registered owner of a property located on County Blvd.
    in Thunder Bay. This was one of three properties in respect of which the
    appellant had failed to pay municipal taxes. As of December 31, 2011, $5,843.11
    was owing on the County Blvd. property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Municipality took the necessary steps under Part XI of the Act. This
    part provides for the rights of a municipality to sell a taxpayer’s land for
    the recovery of property tax arrears and specifies the procedures to be
    followed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 28, 2012, the Municipality registered a tax arrears certificate
    against title to the property. The certificate stated that the land would be
    sold if the cancellation price (tax arrears, interest, reasonable costs, etc.)
    was not paid within one year following registration of the certificate. Notice
    of registration of the tax arrears certificate was sent to the appellant on
    January 23, 2013. The notice was sent to the appellant at two addresses – the
    County Blvd. address and an address on Simpson St. (a property that was also
    the subject of a municipal tax sale). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 19, 2013, a final notice was sent to the appellant, warning that the
    land would be advertised for public sale failing payment of the cancellation
    price within the prescribed time, in accordance with s. 379 of the Act. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not challenge or respond in any way to the tax sale proceedings.
    The property was offered by the Municipality for sale by public tender and sold
    on June 26, 2014. The sale proceeds exceeded the cancellation price by $76,264.60.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 380(1) of the Act, after payment of the cancellation price, the remaining
    proceeds belonged to the appellant, as there was no other person or party
    having an interest in the land. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    treasurer of the Municipality was required to pay into court the proceeds of
    sale minus the cancellation price, “together with a statement in the prescribed
    form outlining the facts under which the payment into court [was] made”: s.
    380(2). This occurred on September 18, 2014. Within 60 days after making a
    payment into court, the treasurer was required to send a copy of the statement
    to the Public Guardian and Trustee and to the appellant.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The Municipality’s representative deposed that this had occurred.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 380(4), the appellant (and any other person with an interest in the land
    claiming entitlement to the proceeds) had one year from the date of payment
    into court to apply for payment out. In this case there was no one other than
    the appellant with an interest in the land. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    balance of s. 380 provides for the court to determine the entitlements to
    receive payment out of the proceeds of sale, including deemed forfeiture to the
    municipality where no one applies for payment out (s. 380(6)), where there is a
    surplus after the determination of the entitlements of any applicants (s.
    380(6.1)) or where the surplus is $250 or less (s. 380.0.1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    ease of reference I set out here section 380 in its entirety:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(1) The proceeds of a sale under section 379 shall,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) firstly, be applied to pay the cancellation
    price;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) secondly, be paid to all persons, other than
    the owner, having an interest in the land according to their priority at law;
    and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(c) thirdly, be paid to the person who immediately
    before the registration of the tax deed was the owner of the land.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a>&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) The treasurer shall pay the proceeds of sale,
    minus the cancellation price, into the Superior Court of Justice together with
    a statement in the prescribed form outlining the facts under which the payment
    into court is made.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3) Within 60 days after making a payment into court
    under subsection (2), the treasurer shall send a copy of the statement to the
    Public Guardian and Trustee and to the persons to whom the treasurer sent
    notice under subsection 379(1). </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(4) Any person claiming entitlement under clause (1)
    (b) or (c) may apply to the Superior Court of Justice within one year of the
    payment into court under subsection (2) for payment out of court of the amount
    to which the person is entitled.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(5) The court shall, after one year has passed from
    the day the payment was made into court, determine all of the entitlements to
    receive payments out of the proceeds of sale.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(6) If no person makes an application under
    subsection (4) within the one-year period referred to in that subsection, the
    amount paid into court under subsection (2) shall be deemed to be forfeited,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) to the Public Guardian and Trustee if, at the
    time of the registration of the tax arrears certificate, the land was vested in
    the Crown because of an escheat or forfeiture under the <em>Business
    Corporations Act</em> or the <em>Corporations Act</em>; or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) in any other case, to the municipality.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(6.1) If, after the entitlements of all applicants
    under subsection (4) to receive payment out of court have been determined,
    there remains any amount paid into court from the proceeds of sale, the
    remaining amount is deemed to be forfeited,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) to the Public Guardian and Trustee in the
    circumstances described in clause (6) (a);</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) to the municipality in any other case.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(7) The Public Guardian and Trustee or the
    municipality, as the case may be, may apply to the Superior Court of Justice
    for payment out of court of the amount that was paid in.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(8) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the
    Superior Court of Justice may rely on the statement of the Treasurer under
    subsection (2) in determining whether the amount paid into court under that
    subsection is forfeited to the Public Guardian and Trustee or the municipality
    under subsection (6).&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(9) Money received by a municipality under subsection
    (6) shall be paid into the general funds of the municipality.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the Municipality paid the surplus monies into court, the appellant did not
    respond or take any steps in relation to the arrears during the prescribed one
    year period to apply to obtain the funds in court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s explanation for its delay was that, while it was aware that there
    was a one year deadline, it did not receive the notice of payment into court which
    had been sent to the assessed (and sold) property, and that, because there were
    other properties subject to municipal tax sale proceedings, it misjudged the
    point at which the clock began running for the one year period. The appellant
    thought the Municipality would be making decisions about the three properties
    at the same time, and it believed the deadline to apply to the court was in
    October 2015. After a board member questioned when the deadline was, and began
    to look into the issue, the appellant discovered the one year deadline had
    passed. The appellant retained counsel and brought an application promptly on
    notice to the Municipality.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s application was dated October 7, 2015, at a time when the
    Municipality had not yet applied for payment out of court of the surplus funds.
    The application claimed payment out of court. The Municipality’s
    counter-application for payment out was made on November 12, 2015.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its application the appellant asserted that it was entitled to relief from
    forfeiture under s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em> or under s. 5(1)
    of the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Act. </em>Section 98 of the <em>Courts of
    Justice Act</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>A court may grant relief against penalties and
    forfeitures, on such terms as to compensation or otherwise as are considered
    just.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    5(1) of the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Act</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Where a fine is imposed by or under the authority of

    forfeiture. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also noted decisions to the contrary that refused to
    recognize the court’s authority to relieve from a forfeiture arising in the
    municipal context: <em>St. Louis v. Thunder Bay (City)</em> (2005), 16 M.P.L.R.
    (4th) 233 (Ont. Sup. Ct.); and <em>Household Realty Corp. v. Chatham (City)</em> (1988), 42 M.P.L.R. 215 (Ont. Dist. Ct.).<em> </em> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge accepted the authority of a line of cases (that will be
    discussed later in these reasons) that the equitable relief provided for under
    s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em> could not apply to relieve against
    statutory penalties and forfeitures. With respect to the <em>Fines and
    Forfeitures Act</em>, the application judge stated that he did not read that statute
    as applying to municipal tax sales. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Referring
    to authorities dealing with challenges to tax sale proceedings (<em>Zeitel v.
    Ellscheid</em>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 142 and <em>Elliott v. Toronto (City) </em>(1999),
    43 O.R. (3d) 392 (C.A.)), the application judge concluded that the tax sale
    regime is a carefully crafted legislative scheme, and that, while denying a
    remedy deprives the former owner of the surplus proceeds and results in a
    “windfall” for the municipality, it creates certainty and places the obligation
    to act diligently on the delinquent owner. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that, if he had authority to grant relief from
    forfeiture, he would have done so in this case. He noted that the appellant’s
    conduct was inadvertent, although negligent, that a three-week delay would not
    unduly prejudice the Municipality and the disparity between the lateness of the
    application and the value of the property forfeited. </p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Positions of the Parties</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that the application judge erred in law in concluding that he
    did not have jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture. The appellant argues
    that relief from the forfeiture occasioned by s. 380 of the Act is available
    under either or both of the <em>Courts of Justice Act </em>and the <em>Fines
    and Forfeitures Act</em>. Further, since the application judge would have
    granted relief from forfeiture in the circumstances, the appellant submits that
    the appeal should be allowed and an order substituted granting relief from
    forfeiture and payment out of court to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent says that there was no error in the decision of the application
    judge in finding that there was no jurisdiction to grant relief from a forfeiture
    arising under a statute. Further, the respondent contends that to permit relief
    from forfeiture would be inconsistent with the municipal tax scheme which is a
    “complete code”, and would undermine its policies and purpose. Finally, the
    respondent contends that, if the court has the power to grant relief from the
    forfeiture provided by s. 380 of the Act, relief should not be ordered in this
    case, considering the conduct of the appellant in relation to the sale and its
    weak explanation for failing to meet the one year deadline to claim payment out
    of court.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, I would allow the appeal. In my view, there is nothing in the
    scheme outlined in s. 380 of the Act that would preclude this court from
    granting relief from forfeiture under s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act </em>where
    the circumstances warrant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will begin by considering the broad and general language of s. 98 and its
    placement in the <em>Courts of Justice Act.</em> I will then address in turn
    the two impediments to the exercise of this jurisdiction identified by the
    application judge. The first is what he accepted as a general proposition that
    the court does not have the authority under s. 98 to grant relief against
    statutory penalties and forfeitures. I will explain why I conclude that the
    prohibition against such relief is properly limited to circumstances where the
    forfeiture is in the nature of a penalty for breach of the statute; or where the
    statute expressly or by necessary implication precludes equitable relief from
    forfeiture. This will take me to the second impediment identified by the
    application judge: that relief from forfeiture would be contrary to the
    statutory scheme. As I will explain, although s.&nbsp;380 is part of a
    statutory scheme for municipal tax sales, recognizing the court’s ability to
    relieve from forfeiture in an application for payment out of the surplus funds
    would not undermine the certainty or finality of that scheme.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will briefly discuss the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Act </em>and why in my view
    relief under that statute from the forfeiture that occurred here is both not
    contemplated thereunder and unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I will consider the merits respecting relief from forfeiture in this case and explain
    why I would accept the application judge’s assessment that relief from
    forfeiture, on the facts of this case, is warranted. </p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relief from Forfeiture under the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Courts of Justice Act</em> provides for what appears to be broad and
    unlimited authority to the court to grant relief from forfeiture. Section 98 is
    a general provision that states: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>A court may grant relief against penalties and
    forfeitures, on such terms as to compensation or otherwise as are considered
    just.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    98 is found in Part VII of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>. Section 95(1)
    provides that Part VII applies to “civil proceedings” in courts in Ontario.<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> “Civil proceedings” are not only proceedings commenced by statement of claim,
    but include proceedings commenced by application. In this case, s. 380 of the
    Act requires an application to the court before money paid into court will be
    released, whether by the party entitled to the surplus under s.&nbsp;380(4), or
    by the municipality after a deemed forfeiture under s. 380(7). The context of
    the appellant’s claim for relief from forfeiture is within a civil proceeding
    commenced by way of application under s. 380 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    origin of the court’s ability to grant relief from forfeitures and penalties was
    in the equitable jurisdiction of the Chancery Courts. Its scope was limited,
    available only for penalty clauses.  It was also restricted to contracts
    concerning the transfer of proprietary or possessory rights: J. McGee, <em>Snell’s
    Equity </em>3rd ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2010), at para. 13-015. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the fusion of the courts of equity and common law (commencing in 1873 with the <em>Administration
    of Justice Act</em>, S.O. 1873, c. 8 and completed in 1881 with the <em>Ontario
    Judicature Act, 1881</em>, S.O. 1881, c. 5) the ability to grant relief from
    forfeiture was no longer restricted to the Chancery Courts. Section 16 of the <em>Ontario
    Judicature Act, 1881 </em>provided that “in every civil cause or matter
    commenced in the High Court of Justice” where equitable relief was claimed, the
    court was empowered to grant “such and the same relief as ought to have been
    given by the Court of Chancery… before the passing of this Act.&quot;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specific
    statutory authority for granting relief from penalties and forfeitures appeared
    first in the <em>Ontario Judicature Act,</em> following an amendment to that
    Act in 1886: S.O. 1886, c. 16, s. 38(b).  Relief from penalties and forfeitures
    was included as “a rule of law” for “every civil cause or matter commenced in
    the High Court of Justice.” This new statutory power was quickly interpreted as
    having expanded the circumstances in which relief from forfeiture could be
    granted. See, for example, <em>Townsend v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway
    Company </em>(1898), 28 O.R. 195, where Meredith C.J. noted that it was
    “unnecessary to consider what, if any, limit was to be placed upon” the “wide
    general language of [the] provision” (at p. 199). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statutory provision was re-enacted in the various <em>Judicature Acts</em>,
    until the last was repealed and replaced by the <em>Courts of Justice Act, 1984</em>,
    S.O. 1984, c. 11, where it was placed under Part VII (originally as s. 111, and
    now s.&nbsp;98). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    broad wording of s. 98 and its application to civil proceedings, suggest,
    without more, that it should be available in this case, in the context of an
    application to obtain payment out of court of monies deemed to be forfeited to
    the Municipality.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to consider the two impediments that the application judge considered
    insurmountable in applying s. 98 in this case: first that, as a general
    principle, s. 98 would not be available to relieve from a statutory penalty or
    forfeiture, and second that relief from forfeiture is precluded in the absence
    of a specific discretion provided by the legislature as part of the “carefully
    crafted legislative scheme” for municipal tax sales. </p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Penalty or Forfeiture Imposed by Statute</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge referred to two lines of cases as authority that relief from
    forfeiture is not available to relieve from a penalty or forfeiture imposed by
    statute. The first is what I refer to as the <em>McBride </em>line of cases, which
    would preclude such relief as improperly interfering with the legislative
    function. However, this line of cases has been overtaken by a modern approach
    that rejects a categorical exclusion of s. 98 in the case of any forfeiture arising
    under a statutory scheme, and instead considers whether as a matter of
    statutory interpretation, s. 98 may apply.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second line of cases involves true penalties for breach of a statute, where it
    is clear that civil relief from forfeiture should not in any event be
    available.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>McBride</em> line of cases</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    issue in <em>McBride v. Comfort Living Housing Co-operative Inc.</em> (1992), 7
    O.R. (3d) 394 (C.A.) was the termination of rights of occupancy in a
    co-operative housing building. The Court of Appeal, resolving a dispute that
    had waged in the lower courts, decided that the residential tenancy provisions
    of the <em>Landlord and Tenant Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7 did not apply.
    These included specific authority to grant relief against forfeiture. Finlayson
    J.A. referred to s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act </em>as a “general
    provision giving the courts power to relieve against all penalties and
    forfeitures”. He commented that he “[did] not rule out the equitable
    jurisdiction of the court to grant relief against forfeiture apart from the
    provisions of the [residential tenancy legislation]” (at p. 402), but noted
    that equitable relief from forfeiture had not been relied on. He went on to
    comment that s. 98 “apparently does not empower a court to relieve against
    penalties and forfeitures imposed by statute” (at p. 402), citing <em>Webb v.
    Box</em> (1909), 14 O.W.R. 802 (Div. Ct.), leave to appeal ref’d (1910), 15
    O.W.R. 205 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    comments by the court are <em>obiter. </em>Relief from forfeiture under the <em>Courts
    of Justice Act </em>was not requested by the moving party, and the forfeiture
    in question arose under an occupancy agreement, not as the result of the
    failure to comply with a statutory requirement. Perhaps Finlayson J.A. was
    attempting to define the outer limits for such relief – that it would not
    “apparently” apply to a penalty or forfeiture “imposed by statute”. What he
    meant by a forfeiture imposed by statute was however not entirely clear.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fact, the case referred to by Finlayson J.A., <em>Webb v. Box</em>, involved a
    true breach of a statutory provision (illegal distress by a landlord), and its prescribed
    consequence (payment to the tenant of double the value of goods). The landlord
    claimed relief from forfeiture under the <em>Judicature Act</em> to reduce the
    payment to the tenant to the actual value of the goods seized. In refusing such
    relief at first instance, Chancellor Boyd commented that to do so “would be to
    repeal by adjudication what the legislature has distinctly provided for, not so
    much in the way of penalty as to afford protection to tenants against
    unwarrantable seizure and sales of property to the great detriment of the
    tenants’ rights” (at p. 804). Leave to appeal to this court was refused, with Meredith
    J.A. observing that to take away the double value damages would “repeal the
    statute” (at p. 208). Citing <em>Keating v. Sparrow</em> (1810), 1 Ball &amp; B.
    367, he went on to query, “…apart from these considerations, what power has the
    Court to relieve from even a penalty imposed by statute, except under R.S.O.
    1897, ch. 108 [a predecessor of s. 5(1) of the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Act</em>]?”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main reason for the court’s refusal of relief in <em>Webb v. Box </em>was that
    the statutory scheme specifically provided for the payment of double value of the
    goods as the consequence of unlawful distress. Even if the requirement to pay
    double value of the goods seized were characterized as a penalty then the only
    power to relieve from such a penalty would be under the equivalent to the <em>Fines
    and Forfeitures Act. </em>Again, the comment about the limitations on equitable
    relief from forfeiture was <em>obiter </em>to the court’s decision.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    origin of the statement that the court has no power to relieve against
    statutory penalties and forfeitures is the 1810 decision of the Irish High
    Court of Chancery in <em>Keating v. Sparrow. </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Keating
    v. Sparrow </em>however was decided when civil relief from forfeiture was
    limited to circumstances where the forfeiture was designed to secure the
    payment of money. More importantly, at the time of the decision there was no
    statutory provision for relief from forfeiture. The court was unwilling to
    apply equitable jurisdiction to override the legislative will expressed in a
    statute. The equitable jurisdiction to relieve against penalties and
    forfeitures has since been both expanded and legislated.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
    cases took the approach referred to in <em>obiter</em> in <em>McBride</em>. An
    example is <em>Johnson v. Dominion of Canada Guarantee and Accident Insurance
    Co. </em>(1908), 12 O.W.R. 980 (C.A.), where this court held that relief from
    forfeiture under the <em>Judicature Act</em> was not available to relieve from
    the requirement of providing timely proof of loss under an insurance contract.
    The court was confronted with the sympathetic case of a claim made out of time
    for a survivor’s benefit through no real fault of the claimant. In overturning
    the decision of Chancellor Boyd advocating a liberal interpretation of the
    court’s power under the <em>Judicature Act </em>and granting relief from
    forfeiture, this court noted that the legislature had “gone to great pains to
    regulate contracts of insurance” (at p. 982).  Meredith J.A. stated that it
    would be “legislation, not adjudication” to grant relief from forfeiture other
    than as provided under the insurance statute itself. By 1994 however, the
    Supreme Court of Canada rejected an argument based on <em>Johnson </em>and
    stated that the case  was  no longer good law, as the court wrongly treated the
    insurance legislation at issue as a statutory code: <em>Saskatchewan River
    Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co.</em>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 490, at 505-506. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evolution in the court’s approach is reflected in <em>State Farm Mutual
    Automobile Insurance Co. v. Ontario (Minister of Finance)</em> (2001), 53 O.R.
    (3d) 436. In that case an insured failed to provide a proof of loss within the 90
    days prescribed by a regulation under the <em>Insurance Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. I.8. The application judge denied relief from forfeiture under s. 98 of the <em>Courts
    of Justice Act</em>,<em> </em>stating that it was questionable “whether the
    court has any jurisdiction to relieve against a penalty or forfeiture that is
    decreed by statute” (at para. 38), referring to authorities including <em>McBride</em>.
    He concluded that “even assuming there is some residual jurisdiction in the
    court to relieve against penalties and forfeitures imposed by statute” (at
    para. 40), he could not see how the jurisdiction could arise in a situation
    where the legislature has “occupied the field” and stipulated for relief to be
    given in certain defined conditions; conditions the party seeking relief had
    failed to meet (at paras. 37 and 32) </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to this court (reported as <em>Kingsway General Insurance Co. v. West
    Wawanosh Insurance Co.</em> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 251 (C.A.)), Sharpe J.A.
    concluded that the court should not exercise “any general discretion it might
    have” under s. 98 to grant relief from forfeiture, because the regulation in
    question “provides a scheme that contemplates extensions of the 90-day notice
    period in certain circumstances, and that, by implication, any general
    discretion a court might have to grant extensions in other circumstances is
    excluded” (at para. 13). Sharpe J.A. approached the issue not through a blanket
    prohibition against the use of s. 98 relief from forfeiture in instances of statutory
    forfeitures, but by considering the statutory scheme itself. The focus of the
    analysis was on whether “by implication any general discretion a court might
    have…is excluded”. In that case, the provision for relief from forfeiture
    contained in the regulation was considered to be exhaustive, and therefore no
    further relief was available under s. 98.<em> </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question is not whether there is a statutory scheme, but whether the language
    and scheme of the statute would exclude relief from forfeiture under s. 98.
    This is now firmly the approach taken in the case of forfeitures arising under
    insurance contracts governed by the <em>Insurance Act. </em>Relief from
    forfeiture under s. 98 is available where the insured’s breach constitutes
    imperfect compliance with a policy term and the specific relief from forfeiture
    provisions under the <em>Insurance Act </em>do not apply: <em>Kozel v. Personal
    Insurance Co.</em>, 2014 ONCA 130, 119 O.R. (3d) 55. As LaForme J.A. noted in <em>Kozel</em> at para. 58:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…in the absence of clear legislative intent indicating that s.
    129 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> applies to the exclusion of s. 98 of the <em>CJA</em>,
    I would hold that the latter provision is available as an avenue of relief for
    contracts governed by the <em>Insurance Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>See
    also <em>Lavoie v. T.A. McGill Mortgage Services Inc</em>., 2014 ONCA 257, 119
    O.R. (3d) 651, where this court upheld the ruling in <em>Kozel </em>that relief
    against forfeiture under s. 98 may be available, however the facts in <em>Lavoie</em> were not amenable to such relief. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this is the approach that should govern in the present case. Section
    98 is a statutory provision expressed in broad and general terms to be
    available in civil proceedings. Where a forfeiture occurs under a statutory
    scheme, the scheme should be examined in order to determine whether by
    necessary implication relief from forfeiture under s. 98 would be precluded. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also referred to a second line of cases in concluding that the
    court does not have the power to grant relief against statutory penalties and
    forfeitures. These cases involved, what I would refer to as “true statutory
    penalties” imposed for breach of a statutory provision. While, this is an
    appropriate limit on s. 98 relief from forfeiture, in my view, none of these
    cases would preclude reliance on s. 98 in the present case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Canadian Northern Railway Co. </em>(1922), 64 S.C.R. 264; on appeal
    to the Privy Council,&nbsp;[1923] 3 W.W.R. 547, the court held relief from
    forfeiture under the Alberta <em>Judicature Act </em>was not available to
    relieve from penalties for failure to pay taxes under federal taxation statutes
    (although the court concluded that the railway was not subject to taxation). In <em>Canada (Attorney General) v. Wheeler</em>, [1944] O.R. 138 (H.C.J.), the
    court concluded that relief from forfeiture under the <em>Judicature Act </em>would
    not be available to relieve against a forfeiture of share warrants imported
    into Canada in contravention of orders and regulations under the <em>War
    Measures Act. </em> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also referred to <em>Mullen v. Flin Flon (City)</em>, 2000
    MBCA 104, 193 D.L.R. (4th) 300, leave to appeal ref’d, 269 W.A.C. 160 (note). In
    that case, a taxpayer claimed relief from forfeiture of its property after a
    completed municipal tax sale, where the taxpayer had not received actual notice
    of the sale and the property was sold to municipal councillors at what was
    described as a “bargain basement” price. The court purported to follow the
    authority of the <em>Canadian Northern</em> and <em>Wheeler</em> cases to
    refuse relief.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of these cases are determinative of whether relief from forfeiture should be
    available in the present case. First, both the <em>Canadian Northern </em>and <em>Wheeler </em>cases involved a forfeiture imposed as a consequence of the breach of a
    statute. As a matter of statutory interpretation, granting relief from
    forfeiture would amount to rewriting or repealing the statute, revoking the very
    consequence for breach of the statute that the legislature prescribed. Further,
    relief from forfeiture under the <em>Judicature Act</em> (and now the <em>Courts
    of Justice Act</em>) would not be available because the ability to grant such
    relief from forfeitures and penalties is in the context of civil proceedings,
    and not criminal or statutory offences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for <em>Flin Flon</em>, it is only by regarding the sale of a taxpayer’s property
    in a tax sale as a forfeiture occurring as a penalty for failure to pay taxes
    that the analysis under the <em>Canadian Northern</em> and <em>Wheeler </em>cases
    would apply. Respectfully, the relief from forfeiture issue in that case could
    have been decided, not by referring to cases involving true statutory
    penalties, but by finding that relief from forfeiture would be contrary to the
    “carefully crafted legislative scheme” for tax sales, as the Supreme Court did
    in <em>Zeitel v. Ellscheid, </em>(discussed below at para. 66). The result
    would have been the same – it would be inconsistent with the finality and
    certainty of the scheme to permit an attack on a tax deed after a tax sale had
    taken place. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not see this line of cases therefore as an impediment to the relief sought
    in the present case. The forfeiture of the surplus to the municipality under s.
    380 is not a penalty for the taxpayer’s failure to pay taxes or breach of any
    other obligation, nor does it occur as the release of security for an
    obligation owed to the municipality. The municipality has already been made
    whole, having received the cancellation price consisting of the tax arrears,
    interest and its costs. The forfeiture does not occur in order to punish the
    property owner, but to ensure that the money, which belongs to the owner or
    other claimants at the time it is paid into court, does not sit in court
    unclaimed, in perpetuity. The forfeiture brings finality to the process where
    funds might otherwise remain in court and unclaimed. The forfeiture arises from
    the failure to meet a time limit, and not as the consequence of any breach of a
    statutory obligation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    such, I would find that there is no absolute bar to granting relief from
    forfeiture in relation to the forfeiture in this case simply because it occurs
    in the context of a statutory scheme. The issue is one of statutory interpretation.
    The question is whether relief from forfeiture is expressly or implicitly
    precluded. I turn to this question now.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Would s. 380, in the Context of the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>, Preclude
    Relief from Forfeiture under s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>? </h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge accepted the argument that relief from forfeiture would not
    be available under s. 98 because the municipal tax sale statutory scheme is a “carefully
    crafted legislative scheme”. He referred to certain cases where the courts
    rejected challenges to the tax sale process and efforts to redeem the subject
    property by owners and mortgagees.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Zeitel v. Ellscheid</em>, the Supreme Court of Canada held that a tax sale
    under the <em>Municipal Tax Sales Act, 1984</em> (the predecessor to Part XI of
    the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>) was immune from attack by a party claiming an
    interest in the property. The court held, at p. 152, that the statute exists
    “to allow property which is the subject of tax arrears to be sold by a
    municipality” and that “purchasers must be assured of the integrity of title so
    with some exceptions when a tax deed is issued it is final”. The court held
    that as a matter of statutory interpretation any attack on the tax deed after
    the tax sale had taken place was not permitted, as the statute provided for a “carefully
    crafted legislative scheme” (at p. 152). This characterization of the statutory
    provisions respecting municipal tax sales has been adopted in numerous
    subsequent cases, including <em>Elliott v. Toronto (City)</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Elliott, </em>the owners and mortgagee of a property subject to a municipal
    tax sale challenged a sale before the registration of a tax deed, in part on
    the basis of lack of actual notice. This court held that there was no right to
    redeem the property by paying the outstanding taxes after the prescribed one
    year period had expired unless the tax sale proceedings were voidable under the
    Act. The court refused to read in additional notice requirements as interfering
    with the carefully crafted legislative scheme and expressed concern about
    impairing the integrity of the tax sale process (at p. 407-408). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    policy reasons for restricting the circumstances in which municipal tax sales might
    be challenged (certainty, finality and the integrity of the sale process,
    including interests of third parties) are not engaged when dealing with the
    surplus under s. 380.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]</span></span></span></a> The taxpayer is not challenging the sale process, but asserting a claim to the surplus.
    Section 380 operates after the municipality has recovered its tax arrears and
    its costs, at a time when its claim against the property is spent, and without
    affecting the rights or interests of third party purchasers. At issue under s.
    380 is entitlement to the surplus, not the property itself. As such, there is
    no prospect of interfering with or undermining the municipal tax sale process. 
        </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    read the Act’s provisions as consistent with, and not precluding, the ability
    of the court to relieve from forfeiture in an appropriate case. First, the
    statute states specifically to whom the sale proceeds “shall be paid.” After
    payment of the cancellation price, payment is to persons with a prior interest
    in the land, and then to the owner: s. 380(1).  Second, the statute requires
    the municipality to pay the surplus into court: s. 380(2). Arguably, if the
    intent were to provide for an absolute forfeiture to a municipality on default
    of a claim to the funds, there would be no reason to require the involvement of
    the court, until there is a dispute about priorities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the statute does not provide that the unclaimed surplus belongs to the municipality,
    but “deems” a forfeiture in three circumstances: (1) if the surplus is $250 or
    less; (2) if those entitled to the money have not applied for payment out
    within a year; or (3) if there is any surplus left after the payment out to a
    claimant (presumably because the owner has not made a claim). At the time the
    surplus was paid into court in this case, it belonged to the appellant, since
    there was no other party with an interest in the land, and it was only at the
    one year period without an application by the claimant, that it was “deemed
    forfeited” to the municipality. The municipality has no right to the funds
    absent a forfeiture, and in every case where the surplus is forfeited to the
    municipality, the municipality receives a windfall. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    and most importantly, the statute requires an application to the court for payment
    out, whether it is by the taxpayer or by the municipality. In this way, the
    court retains jurisdiction over the process, and the parties of necessity are
    engaged in a “civil proceeding”. The requirements for payment into the Superior
    Court of Justice, and for an application in all cases for payment out
    anticipate that the court will have at its disposal all authority available to
    it under the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, including under s. 98. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that the court’s general authority to relieve against
    forfeitures under s. 98 would be available in the context of a deemed
    forfeiture under s. 380, in circumstances such as are present in this case.
    There is no clear legislative intent to exclude relief from forfeiture, nor is
    the recognition of such authority inconsistent with the statutory scheme. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relief under the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Act</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of my conclusion that a court considering an application in respect of
    a surplus under s. 380 would have jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture
    under s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act, </em>it is unnecessary to
    consider in any detail the alternative claim that relief should be granted
    under s. 5 of the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Ac</em>t, which provides the
    Superior Court the authority to “remit in whole or in part” a “fine” (defined
    to include a forfeiture). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, a fair reading of that statute suggests that it applies in
    the context of fines, penalties and forfeitures that are imposed for violations
    of Ontario statutes. And as such, it has no application to the facts of this
    case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall
    that s. 5(1) deals with the remission of fines (defined to include “all
    pecuniary fines, penalties and forfeitures”):</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>5. (1) Where a fine is imposed by or under the
    authority of an Act of the Legislature, the court or judge having cognizance of
    the proceedings for the recovery thereof may at any time after the commencement
    thereof remit in whole or in part such fine, whether the money is in whole or
    in part payable to the Crown or to some person other than the Crown and whether
    it is recoverable by indictment, information, summary process, action or
    otherwise. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2 of the <em>Fines and Forfeitures Act </em>provides that “where a fine has
    been imposed <em>for a contravention</em> of an Act of the Legislature or a
    regulation made thereunder and no other provision is made for its recovery, it
    is recoverable with costs by a civil action at the suit of the Crown” (emphasis
    added). Section 3 provides that, where no other mode of recovery is prescribed,
    a fine may be recovered upon indictment in the Superior Court of Justice. Section
    4 also refers to fines “imposed for a <em>contravention</em> of any statute”
    and directs their payment, except so far as other provision is made in respect
    thereto, to the Treasurer of Ontario (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading
    these provisions together suggests that the ability of the court to remit a
    fine, penalty or forfeiture is in the context of proceedings for their recovery
    where they have been imposed for contraventions of a statute (and where no
    other provision is made in respect thereof). In this case, the deemed
    forfeiture arises from the expiry of a time limit under s. 380 of the Act, and
    is not a penalty “imposed” for a “contravention” of the Act. In any event, as I
    have found that relief from forfeiture here would be available under s. 98 of
    the <em>Courts of Justice Act, </em>it is unnecessary to offer any definitive
    views about the scope and availability of relief under s. 5 of the <em>Fines
    and Forfeitures Act.</em> </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should Relief from Forfeiture be Granted in this Case?         </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    exercising discretion to grant relief from forfeiture in a particular case, a
    court must first consider: (1) the conduct of the applicant; (2) the gravity of
    the breach; and (3) the disparity between the value of the property forfeited
    and the damage caused by the breach: <em>Dube v. RBC Life Insurance Co.</em>,
    2015 ONCA 641, 127 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 6; <em>Kozel</em>, at paras. 31 and
    59; <em>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co.</em>,
    at p. 504. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had
    the trial judge concluded that s. 98 was available, he would have exercised his
    discretion to grant relief from forfeiture and to allow the appellant’s late
    application for payment out of court of the surplus funds. He found that the
    appellant’s conduct was inadvertent, although negligent, and that the Municipality
    did not suffer undue prejudice from the three-week delay. He noted the
    disparity between the short delay in applying and the value of the property
    forfeited (at para. 64). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no reason to depart from the application judge’s assessment of the relevant
    factors in this case. The appellant would have been entitled to the monies in
    court, without any claim by the Municipality, had its application been
    initiated three weeks earlier. The appellant’s delay was explained by its
    erroneous belief about timing because of its two other properties also subject
    to tax sales. When it realized its error, the appellant moved promptly. The
    Municipality had not received the funds, and had not even commenced an
    application for payment out. And the windfall to the Municipality would have
    been enormous, amounting to the receipt of $76,264.60 in surplus funds when the
    initial tax arrears, which had been fully satisfied, were $5,843.11.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    I would grant the appellant relief against forfeiture under s. 98 of the <em>Courts
    of Justice Act</em>.</p>
  <h1>F.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disposition</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons I would allow the appeal and set aside the order of the
    application judge. I would grant relief from forfeiture and order payment out
    of court of the sum of $76,264.60 paid to the credit of Court File No.
    CV-14-0344-00 at the Superior Court of Justice in Thunder Bay, plus accrued
    interest. Such payment shall be made to Rene Larson Law Office Professional
    Corporation on behalf of the appellant.&nbsp; As agreed between the parties, I
    would make no order as to costs.</p>
