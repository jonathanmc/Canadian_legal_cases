  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Jennifer
    Blishen of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, on October
    11, 2013.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction on two counts of assault causing
    bodily harm in relation to his two-month-old infant. The infant suffered 12 rib
    fractures. The evidence was that the fractures were incurred on two separate occasions
    during the course of a hospital stay at the Childrens Hospital of Eastern
    Ontario (CHEO).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the verdict on the first count was
    unreasonable or, in the alternative, the trial judge failed to properly apply the
    principles in <em>R. v. W. (D.)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742</span></em>. With respect to the second count, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in her application of <em>mens rea</em> for assault causing bodily harm and misapplied the test for implied consent in
    the context of a parent-child relationship.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The First Conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is our view that the verdict in relation to the first set of
    fractures is reasonable. The scope of appellate review for unreasonable verdict
    is narrow. To determine the reasonableness of the verdict this court must
    decide, on the evidence as a whole, whether the verdict is one that a properly
    instructed trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered: <em>R.
    v. Pannu, </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>2015 ONCA 677</span></em>,
    127 O.R. (3d) 545, at paras. 161-163.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trier of fact can accept some, none, or all of what a witness says. We
    see no error in the trial judges factual findings in this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, she determined that the factures occurred sometime between
    January 25 and January 30, 2011. This conclusion was based on the expert
    evidence and the interpretation of the x-ray results. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the fact that the infant suffered a left anterior rib fracture and
    a right posterior rib fracture, and in light of the fact that there was no history
    of impact or accident, the trial judge accepted the expert evidence as to the
    potential causes of the injuries. The expert evidence supported that the
    fractures were non-accidental compression fractures from squeezing the front
    and back of the childs ribcage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also considered the appellants evidence and his
    admission that he grabbed the infant hard around the ribs in an effort to
    prevent a fall and that this might have caused fractures. The way the appellant
    described this fall was inconsistent with the expert evidence on the nature,
    location, and likely causes of the injuries. The trial judge therefore found
    the appellants story to not be credible. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The injuries were localized to the ribcage, just under the infants armpits.
    The expert evidence was corroborated by the observations of nurse Munro, who saw
    the appellant holding the baby under his armpits. As pointed out by the Crown,
    the trial judge was entitled to consider all of the evidence, including the observations
    by the two nurses of instances where the infant screamed out
    uncharacteristically. We agree that she was entitled to accept how the nurses
    professional experience informed their observations.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all the circumstances, based on the evidence, the trial judge was entitled to
    find that the appellant had caused the fractures to his son, and in our view,
    her factual findings are reasonable and entitled to deference.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in her application of the
    reasonable doubt standard pursuant to <em>W. (D.)</em>. We do not agree. While
    the trial judge did not recite the test as articulated in <em>W. (D.)</em>, she
    did consider all of the evidence and found that the appellants innocent
    explanation for the fractures was not credible or reliable. She rejected the
    appellants evidence in light of competing evidence, considered the Crowns
    case, and found his guilt was established beyond a reasonable doubt. Although
    she did not explicitly refer to the second step of the <em>W. (D.)</em> analysis, a precise articulation of the <em>W. (D.) </em>formula is not
    required: <em>R. v. C.L.Y.</em>, 2008 SCC 2, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 7.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Supreme Court of Canada recently reiterated in <em>R. v. Vuradin</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> [2013] 2 S.C.R. 639, at para. 27, when
    a trial judge rejects an accuseds testimony in a trial by a judge alone, it
    can generally be concluded that the testimony also failed to raise a reasonable
    doubt in the trial judges mind. In our opinion, that is the situation here. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal in relation to count one is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Second Conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the second set of rib fractures occurred between January
    30 and February 3, 2011. She also found that they occurred when the appellant
    squeezed or compressed the babys chest in an attempt to revive him during an
    apneic episode.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that where consent is at issue, the Crown must prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to cause bodily harm in order to
    secure a conviction. He relies on <em>R. v. McDonald</em>, 2012 ONCA 379, 284
    C.C.C. (3d) 470, and related cases. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits that the trial judge did not reject his evidence that
    he was attempting to administer CPR to the child because the childs life was
    in danger. He says it is reasonable to imply the childs consent for the
    appellant to have applied at least some force to save his life. The appellant
    submits that consent only becomes a nullity when the Crown proves that the
    appellant intentionally caused the bodily harm to the child.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decisions
    like <em>McDonald</em> about adults engaged in consensual fights are
    fundamentally different than those involving children. As this court noted in <em>R.
    v. A.E.</em> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 449, at para. 28:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>It was noted in <em>Jobidon</em> that policy based limits on
    consent are almost always the product of a balancing of individual autonomy and
    some larger societal interest. In the <em>Jobidon</em> situation, public policy
    vitiates the voluntary decision of the victim to consent. In this case, there
    is no concern about balancing an infants individual autonomy, or its freedom
    to choose to have force intentionally applied to itself. An infant is uniquely
    vulnerable to the quality of care and the decisions made on its behalf by its
    parents. The balancing exercise is therefore a different one.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly recognized that even if she did accept the appellants
    evidence that he was attempting to administer CPR, the force applied must not
    be excessive for the defence of deemed consent to apply: <em>A.E.</em>, at
    para. 37. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    reasonable person would realize that the force applied to the infant, enough to
    cause ten anterior and posterior fractures, was excessive and outside the range
    of normal care even in these urgent circumstances. The defence of implied
    consent therefore does not arise on the circumstances of this case. In our
    opinion she did not err in law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits that the trial judge was required to come to her own
    decision as to whether the appellant applied excessive force or acted outside
    what a reasonable parent would. She simply quoted the expert evidence as
    opposed to making her own finding.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges reference to the expert evidence was a shorthand way of accepting
    the expert evidence. Dr. Putnins explained that while it is possible to
    fracture ribs while performing CPR, this would occur after prolonged CPR. This
    is rare and the fractures would be anterior, not posterior, and would be fewer
    in number. Here the evidence was that the CPR was relatively brief and there
    were ten fractures. The submission that the expert evidence should be rejected
    because the studies in question related to persons trained to do CPR, raised
    for the first time on appeal, finds no support in the evidence.  </p>
