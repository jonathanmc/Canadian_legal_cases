  <p class=Namesofparty>AN APPEAL UNDER PART XX.1 OF THE <em>CODE</em></p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Gustavo Gonzalez, not present</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Anita Szigeti, appearing as <em>Amicus Curiae</em></p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Mike Callaghan, for the Attorney General of Ontario</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Janice Blackburn, for the person in charge of Waypoint
    Centre for Mental Health Care</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard: October 17, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board dated, January 6, 2016, with reasons reported at [2016] O.R.B.D. No. 163.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:100%'>Lauwers J.A.:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gustavo Gonzalez appeals the disposition of the Ontario Review Board
    that ordered him to be detained at the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care, Ontario’s
    only maximum secure forensic psychiatric facility, where he has been held since
    January 18, 2006. </p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:100%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Background Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Gonzalez was found not criminally responsible on account of mental
    disorder on a charge of attempted murder in contravention of the <em><span
style='line-height:100%'>Criminal Code</span></em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The
    index offence occurred on June 7, 2001. The victim was a psychiatrist, Dr. Jun
    Bi Tu, who had treated the appellant some 10 years before. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was originally diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder,
    Paraphilia (Exhibitionism) and Anxiety Disorder. He is presently treatment
    capable, but has not cooperated with treating physicians for years. The
    Hospital Report filed with the Review Board lists the current psychiatric diagnoses
    as: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis I:                    Paraphilia – Exhibitionism, Query
    Delusional Disorder</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis II:         Paranoid Personality Disorder with Antisocial
    and Narcissistic Traits</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis III:        Depressed Skull Fracture (2005), Resolved</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Axis IV         Psychosocial Stressors – Perceived Unjustified
    Incarceration</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are two issues on this appeal: First, does Mr. Gonzalez pose a
    significant threat to the safety of the public as defined in s. 672.5401 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>? Second, has a treatment impasse been reached between
    Mr. Gonzalez and Waypoint and, if so, what should be done about it?</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Standard of Review</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard of review of a disposition or placement decision of the
    Board by this court is set out in s. 672.78(1) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i> This
    court can only set aside an order of the Board where it is of the opinion that:
    the decision is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence; it is
    based on a wrong decision on a question of law; or there was a miscarriage of
    justice: <i>R. v Owen</i>, 2003 SCC 33, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779, at paras. 31-37.
    See <i>Re Hart</i> 2016 ONCA 277, at para. 6.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeading1Linespacingsingle>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issue One: Does the Appellant Pose<span class=MsoPageNumber> a
    Significant Threat to the Safety of the Public?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>Mr.
    Gonzalez provided a lengthy and closely reasoned written submission. He is
    articulate, organized and evidently highly intelligent. Mr. Gonzalez did not
    appear at the hearing of the appeal but advised that he would let his statement
    speak for him. He denies that he attempted to murder Dr. Tu. He seeks “a
    removal of all psychiatric diagnoses.” He asks rhetorically: “Isn’t fifteen
    years of psychiatry – enforced confinement, extortion, fabrications, bickering,
    vilification, and irreparable damage to my repute, enough revenge for the
    offence that is believed I committed?” </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>The
    appellant’s position, as summarized briefly by court appointed </span></span><em>amicus
    curiae</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, is this</span></em><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>: he is not a significant
    threat and ought to be absolutely discharged, and in the alternative, the Board
    acted unreasonably and erred in law by failing to transfer him to a medium
    security institution.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 672.54 of the Criminal Code, the Review Board must assess
    whether the NCR accused remains “a significant threat to the safety of the
    public,” which is the “paramount consideration”. See <i>Re Carrick </i>2015
    ONCA 866, 128 O.R. (3d) 209, at paras. 11-17.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Dr. A. Danyluk testified that she has been the appellant’s treating
    psychiatrist since August 2015. He has refused to speak to her. The appellant is
    angry, irritable and contemptuous of the people and systems that keep him in
    detention. He continues to deny he had any involvement in the index offence but
    has admitted to threatening the Crown Attorney. In June 2015, the appellant was
    reported to have attempted to hide a metal fork and spoon that could have been
    used as weapons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Danyluk testified that while <span class=MsoPageNumber><span
style='line-height:100%'>Mr. Gonzalez</span></span> had not been physically
    threatening in the last year (in fact, for many years), she did not consider it
    advisable to transfer him to a less secure facility because the staff and
    others would be unfamiliar with his excessive verbal aggression. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Dr. Danyluk’s opinion the appellant continues to pose a significant
    threat to the safety of the public. He has very poor, if any, insight into his
    illness and his need for treatment. He has persecutory ideas. The appellant
    scores at the medium to high range on the PCL-R and VRAG.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>The Review
    Board’s unanimous conclusion, expressed at para. 47 of its reasons, is that “Mr.
    Gonzalez poses a significant threat to the safety of the public as defined at
    s. 672.5401 of the </span></span><em><span style='line-height:100%'>Criminal
    Code</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>.” The
    Board added, at para. 50, that if he were to be discharged absolutely, “</span></span>there
    is a risk of serious physical or psychological harm to members of the public
    resulting from conduct that is criminal in nature” and “would also be violent.”
    The Board accepted the Crown’s suggestion that Mr. Gonzalez is a &quot;ticking
    time bomb&quot;.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'> The
    Board relied on the evidence of Dr. Danyluk, who endorsed the Hospital Report,
    and gave the following reasons, at para 48:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) Mr. Gonzalez continues to suffer from a major mental
    illness; (b) that illness is currently untreated; (c) notwithstanding the
    absence of recent physical assaultiveness, he continues to harbour the same
    view of mental health workers generally that appears to have motivated the
    index offence; (d) he has a history of patient premeditation for an extended
    period leading up to an act of extreme violence; (e) he has recently attempted
    to take metal utensils that were potential weapons; (f) he scores relatively
    high on both actuarial tools on which he has been scored; (g) he continues to
    refuse to engage with any treatment team members making it difficult for them
    to assess the risk he presents and to suggest treatment that will assist him;
    and (h) the seriousness and level of violence of the index offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Gonzalez continues to <span class=MsoPageNumber><span
style='line-height:100%'>pose a significant threat to the safety of the public
    as defined by s. 672.5401 of the </span></span><em><span style='line-height:
200%'>Criminal Code</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span
style='line-height:100%'>. The Board’s decision is plainly reasonable and is
    amply supported by the evidence. On the evidence, there is no support for an
    absolute discharge. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></span></p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issue Two: Has a Treatment Impasse been Reached?</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>Mr.
    Gonzalez’s submission shows he is passionately opposed to psychiatry and to
    psychiatrists. He has no faith whatsoever in Waypoint staff, including his
    current attending psychiatrist, Dr. Danyluk, with whom he has had no
    therapeutic contact.  </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><em>Amicus</em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span
style='line-height:100%'> supports the appellant’s position that the Board
    erred in not transferring him to a medium security psychiatric facility. In
    particular, she</span></span><em><span style='font-style:normal'> argues that
    such a transfer is necessary in order to facilitate an independent assessment
    of Mr. Gonzalez, which she asserts is necessary</span></em><em> </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>“</span></em><span class=MsoPageNumber><span
style='line-height:100%'>to break the treatment impasse manifestly reached now
    at Waypoint.” <i>Amicus</i> contends that </span></span>it was legally
    incumbent on the Review Board,<span style='line-height:100%'> with a view to
    ending the impasse,</span> to address it remedially by<span style='line-height:
200%'> ordering some form of alternative assessment</span>. She <span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>observes: “Staff at Waypoint
    had not managed to provide the appellant with any real treatment for 10 years.”
    Undeniably, as Dr. Danyluk noted, there has been an “utter lack of progress.”</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Treatment impasse was a live issue before the Review Board; this court
    raised the issue directly when it dismissed Mr. Gonzalez’s appeal from the last
    disposition of the Review Board (with reasons reported at 2015 ONCA 650). The
    court found merit in the argument that a treatment impasse might have been
    reached, and signalled its expectation for the next hearing, at para. 4: “<span
style='line-height:100%'>The Board will no doubt give careful consideration to
    exercising the jurisdiction described at para. 42 of <i>Mazzei<em> </em></i><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[</span></em><em>Mazzei v. British Columbia (Director
    of Adult Forensic Psychiatric Services)</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, 2006
    SCC 7, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 326].” The court added:</span> “The hospital should be
    prepared to assist the Board in that regard.”</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>In this case, after 28 years it is clear that the high level of

    the institution has no treatment plan with prospects of leading to a different
    situation. Rather than simply recapitulating the static situation and ordering
    that the appellant continue to be detained, an exercise of the Board’s
    inquisitorial role may have resulted in the appellant’s continued detention
    being subject to a condition ordering a comprehensive review of his situation

    what specific actions might conceivably lead to a break in the impasse, or even

    at para. 30: “The Board refused to attribute Mr. Conway’s lack of progress
    since 2005 to his treatment team, suggesting instead that progress was more
    likely impeded by “Mr. Conway’s incessant harassment and his obstructionistic
    tactics.”” Justice Lang agreed, stating at para. 67: “It was both an error of
    law and unreasonable for the Board not to impose conditions in light of the
    uncontradicted evidence that, despite 24 years of detention, Mr. Conway had
    received no effective treatment.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    entitled, under its supervisory powers, to order a re-evaluation of current or
    past treatment approaches and an exploration of alternative approaches. The Board
    must form its own independent opinion about the accused’s treatment plan and
    clinical progress, and in doing so, it may order an independent assessment in

  <p class=AParaNumbering align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Review Board characterized this court’s endorsement on Mr.
    Gonzalez’s appeal from his last disposition as “<em>obiter dicta,</em>” at
    para. 51. The Board concluded, at para. 53: “Having carefully considered the
    evidence and those submissions, the Board finds that, with all due deference to
    that honourable court, treatment impasse of the kind contemplated in the <em>Mazzei</em> case has not been reached.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=left style='text-align:left;
'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s reasoning is set out at para. 54:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This is not a situation where the hospital has tried every
    avenue of treatment (pharmacological or otherwise) that its staff thinks
    reasonable, nor has the treatment team given up on helping Mr. Gonzalez improve
    his mental condition or reintegration into society. Rather, forward progress
    has been stopped by Mr. Gonzalez's obstinate refusal to engage in any discourse
    or treatment whatsoever. Such an impasse, if it can be called that, is not one
    that can be resolved by the Board exercising its discretion as contemplated in <i>Mazzei</i>.
    Forward progress can only be achieved by either Mr. Gonzalez abandoning his
    resolute rejection of all Canadian psychiatrists in every aspect of the
    Canadian forensic mental health system; or by a finding of incapacity to
    consent to treatment that is upheld by the bodies whose responsibility it is to
    review such decisions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In declining to order Mr. Gonzalez’s transfer to another facility, the
    Review Board observed, at para. 55: “the disdain that he demonstrates for
    psychiatrists and the mental health system is not limited to a particular
    individual or hospital, and there is no reason to believe that any other
    psychiatrist or hospital would be any better able to get past the blank wall of
    his resistance.”</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=MsoPageNumber>There is no real treatment plan in place at
    Waypoint, as acknowledged by the Board at para. 35: “</span>Dr. Danyluk
    testified in response to questions from the Board that the only way she
    currently can see for Mr. Gonzalez to move forward, if he continues to refuse
    to engage with the team, is to explore the possibility of a finding of
    incapacity for treatment decisions.” The purpose for pursuing a finding of
    incapacity is so that he could be involuntarily treated with psychotropic
    medications, which he has steadfastly refused. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Crown and the Hospital take the
    position that when a capable NCR accused simply declines treatment, no
    treatment impasse has been reached and point to several of this court’s
    decisions, mostly endorsements, in support. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>I reject this argument, for two
    reasons. First, it is inconsistent with the approach taken by the Supreme Court
    in <i>Mazzei</i>, and by this court in <i>LePage</i> and <i>Conway</i>. In
    these cases, each of the NCR accused, like Mr. Gonzalez, had been refusing
    treatment for a long time and had made no progress. The standoffs were
    longstanding and unlikely to resolve.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Second, this court’s decisions
    offered in support by the Crown and the Hospital are distinguishable on several
    bases. None of the standoffs were as longstanding or as intractable as the one
    with Mr. Gonzalez, at 10 years. There is no basis for optimism that the
    treatment plan in place will gain traction with Mr. Gonzalez, unlike in <i>Re
    O’Donnell</i> 2014 ONCA 18, where Feldman J.A. noted, at para. 33, that: “</span>Although
    the appellant had not made any significant progress at Oak Ridge by the time of
    the hearing, it was not unforeseeable that he could progress in the future.” It
    is also unlike <i>Re Armstrong</i> 2015 ONCA 326, where the Board noted that
    the accused’s father had agreed to assist in persuading him to consent to
    medication.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>The
    other cases advanced by the Crown and the Hospital are also distinguishable. In <i>Re Shaikh</i> 2008 ONCA 114, the NCR accused was held in a minimum security
    facility and the dispute was over conditions for community living.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:100%'>Finally, in the <i>Robertson</i> sequence of cases, (2009 ONCA 860, 2012 ONCA 889, 2015 ONCA
    417), this court noted in 2009, at para 3, that: “</span></span>The appellant
    was continuing treatment at the time of the Board hearing and there were other
    treatment alternatives the appellant could pursue at Oak Ridge.” This suggests
    that the standoff was not as longstanding, although there is little information
    on this issue in the endorsements. Short endorsements of this court on ORB
    appeals fall squarely within the caution expressed in <i><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>R. v. Singh</span></i><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>, 2014 ONCA 293, 120 O.R. (3d) 76</span>,
    at para. 12:  “While all decisions of this court are binding, care must be
    taken to avoid reading unwarranted jurisprudential principles into a decision
    of the court rendered in [a brief] endorsement.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the appellant’s mental illness has posed a serious obstacle to treatment. If
    the only way forward for the appellant is for him to consent to treatment or be
    declared incapable, and the appellant’s mental illness precludes his consent to
    treatment, but the team has not declared him incapable, then a treatment
    impasse plainly exists. W</span>hile the accused’s attitude might assist in
    explaining why a treatment impasse exists, it does not justify the Review Board’s
    refusal to recognize the treatment impasse, throwing up its hands and
    complacently leaving any future progress up to the accused. </p>

    hospital would be any better able to get past the blank wall of his
