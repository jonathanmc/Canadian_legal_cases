  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, with the assistance of duty counsel, applies for an order
    under s. 684 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> assigning counsel to act on his
    behalf on the appeal. The Crown acknowledges he lacks sufficient means to
    retain legal assistance. The only issue is whether it appears desirable in the
    interests of justice that the appellant should have legal assistance. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Mr. Hasan submits there are three
    grounds on the conviction appeal for which the appellant should have legal
    assistance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>I see no merit in the first submission the
    trial judge erred by not instructing the jury on the dangers of propensity
    reasoning on the multi-count indictment. In my view, this was not a case in
    which it was legal error to fail to give such an instruction. Both sides
    presented significant evidence that applied to all counts – for example, the
    evidence supporting the appellant’s position the complainant had a motive to
    lie. In any event, the jury evidently understood the trial judge’s instruction
    to consider the charges separately: they acquitted the accused on four of the
    six charges he faced. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Nor do I see merit in the submission the
    trial judge failed to instruct the jury on the defence of honest but mistaken
    belief that the complainant consented. In my view there was no air of reality
    to that defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>However, I accept it is arguable the
    trial judge failed to provide the jury with adequate assistance in dealing with
    the assessment of the parties’ credibility (on which the entire case turned).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>First, where, as here, credibility is a
    “crucial issue” at trial, failure to specifically and adequately instruct the
    jury on credibility and the burden of proof may constitute a reversible error.
    As the Supreme Court held in </span><em>R. v. J.H.S.</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2008 SCC 30, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 152, at para. 8: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>A series of decisions over at least
    the past 20 years has affirmed and reaffirmed the proposition that where
    credibility is a central issue in a jury trial, the judge must explain the
    relationship between the assessment of credibility and the Crown’s ultimate
    burden to prove the guilt of the accused to the criminal standard.  A general
    instruction on reasonable doubt without adverting to its relationship to the
    credibility (or lack of credibility) of the witnesses leaves open too great a
    possibility of confusion or misunderstanding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>This concern has at least arguable
    merit on this record. The trial judge did review for the jury the appellant’s position
    the complainant (i) had a motive to fabricate and (ii) might not be reliable
    due to un-medicated bipolar disorder. She also gave a general instruction that
    it was up to the jury how much or little they chose to believe, using their
    common sense, from each witness. But there was no specific instruction on how
    to assess credibility, or the relationship between credibility and the burden
    and standard of proof. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The necessity of such an instruction in
    this case may be considered in the context of Count 2 of the indictment. Count
    2 charged that the appellant assaulted the complainant. The complainant
    testified this occurred that while she was a passenger in a car the appellant
    was driving. Dissatisfied with the way she was handling a call to Community
    Legal Assistance Sarnia, the appellant hit her three times in the head. The
    complainant testified she told the person to whom she was speaking that she was
    being hit. By contrast, the appellant testified that he made the call. The
    secretary of Community Legal Assistance Sarnia was called and testified she
    received a call from the appellant, not the complainant, and there had been no
    allegation of any assault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The trial judge provided no instruction
    to the jury of the import of this evidence for the complainant’s overall credibility
    in the event they concluded she had fabricated or not told the truth about this
    event. Rather, in the course of her instructions on Count 2, the trial judge
    merely told the jury the appellant submitted “that an independent witness…
    supports his version of events as it relates to the incidents surrounding the
    cell phone incident.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>I consider it arguable that a more
    fulsome instruction about credibility assessment was required in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Second, a trial judge should generally
    instruct the jury on the limits of demeanor evidence in assessing credibility.
    The Canadian Judicial Council’s </span><em>Model Jury Instructions</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, Part I, Preliminary Instructions, 4.11 Assessing
    Testimony (online: https://www.nji-inm.ca/index.cfm/publications/model-jury-instructions/?langSwitch=en)
    includes the following instruction:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>What was the witness’s manner when he
    or she testified? Do not jump to conclusions, however, based entirely on the
    witness’s manner. Looks can be deceiving. Giving evidence in a trial is not a
    common experience for many witnesses. People react and appear differently.
    Witnesses come from different backgrounds. They have different intellects, abilities,
    values, and life experiences. <u>There are simply too many variables to make
    the manner in which a witness testifies the only or the most important factor
    in your decision.</u> [Emphasis added].</span></p>

    credibility based on the demeanour of witnesses”: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>It is now acknowledged that demeanour

    provide any assistance to the jury in their consideration of the parties’
    demeanour in the assessment of credibility. In fact, the trial judge emphasized
    the Crown’s position regarding the complainant’s demeanour: her testimony had
    the ring of truth; she testified in a manner that was simple and
    straightforward; she appeared to do her best to answer all of the questions. A
    submission based on the failure to instruct the jury on the limitations of such
    evidence in assessing credibility has arguable merit on this record.</span></p>

    interests of justice that the accused should have legal assistance in advancing
    the ground of appeal that the trial judge provided inadequate assistance to the
    jury in the assessment of credibility.</span></p>

    appeal. The appellant proposes to appeal sentence on the basis of alleged
    errors in respect of the trial judge’s approach to sentencing on the sexual
    assault charge. It does not appear desirable in the interests of justice that
    the appellant should have legal assistance to advance this ground. That is
    because the sentence he received on the sexual assault charge was concurrent to
    his sentence on the sexual assault with a weapon charge. Even if the trial
    judge erred in the manner the appellant alleges, his overall sentence would not
    be affected.</span></p>

    Aid Committee to reconsider its refusal in light of these reasons. In the event
    the Committee maintains its refusal of legal aid, I order Mr. Hassan be
    assigned counsel for the appellant to advance on the appeal the credibility
    ground only, and that his fees and disbursements be paid by the Attorney General
    on the Legal Aid scale.</span> </p>
