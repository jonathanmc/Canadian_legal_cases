lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown appeals from an acquittal on a charge
    of influence peddling, contrary to s. 121(1)(d) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-US>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. This appeal turns on the interpretation of
    “any matter of business” in that provision and whether the respondent’s
    admitted activities were in connection with “any matter of business relating to
    the government”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent, Bruce Carson, was a senior
    advisor in the Office of the Prime Minister from 2006 to 2008 and briefly in 2009.
    In 2010, he negotiated a contract with H2O Professionals Inc. (“H2O”), which
    provided for commissions to be paid to his then girlfriend on all sales by H2O
    of water treatment systems to First Nations. The respondent did not personally
    sign the contract, as it was a contract between his girlfriend and H2O; the
    second version of the contract appointed his girlfriend as H2O’s “exclusive
    agent of [H2O] for the purpose of representing [H2O] in all matters relating to
    the sale of Water Purification Products to First Nations … (including dealing with
    the government of Canada relating to the sale of Water Purification Products to
    First Nations).”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was understood that the respondent would use
    his government contacts to help H2O sell its water treatment systems to First
    Nations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the respondent admitted that he was a
    person who had influence with the government and that he had demanded a benefit
    for his girlfriend in exchange for exercising his influence on behalf of H2O. The
    only issue at trial was whether the respondent’s exercise of influence was in
    connection with “any matter of business relating to the government”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown and the defence agreed to apply all of
    the evidence from the preliminary hearing to the trial. No witnesses were
    called at the trial and one additional document was filed as an exhibit, which was
    filed on consent. It was a government document published by Indian and Northern
    Affairs Canada (INAC), entitled </span><em>Protocol for Decentralized Water and
    Wastewater Systems in First Nations Communities</em><span lang=EN-US> (the
    “Protocol for Decentralized Water”). The purpose of the Protocol for
    Decentralized Water was to establish standards and codes to be followed for
    on-site water treatment systems funded by INAC.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the evidence, the respondent had
    several meetings and was in communication with government officials regarding
    H2O, including INAC employees. He also attempted to influence cabinet ministers
    and their staff for H2O’s benefit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge undertook an analysis of the
    relationship between INAC and First Nations with a view to determining whether
    the respondent’s exercise of influence was connected to a “matter of business
    relating to the government”. She summarized the two kinds of funding First
    Nations receive that can be used to purchase water treatment facilities at paras.
    32 and 33 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>INAC provides two streams of funding to First Nations
    communities. The first stream relates to the operation and maintenance of
    existing facilities and is provided on an annual basis. This type of funding is
    formula-driven based upon a calculation of the size of the community, the
    inventory of assets and the relative lifecycle of those assets. This is the
    bulk of the funding that is provided to First Nations communities. The First
    Nations Band or community has complete autonomy with respect to how to allocate
    those funds each year. Neither INAC nor any other government department or
    official has input into how the community spends those funds. [Stream 1
    funding].</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The second stream of funding is for capital investments such as
    building new or conducting major renovations to existing facilities. This
    stream of funding is allocated based upon priority, need and risk levels. Proposals
    from First Nations communities are submitted to INAC which then considers each
    proposal in relation to the needs and proposals submitted by other First
    Nations communities. If approved, the proposal is placed in a queue with other
    proposals of this nature to be awarded when funds from this stream are
    available.&nbsp;[Stream 2 funding].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First Nations had complete autonomy in deciding whether
    to purchase the smaller decentralized water treatment systems sold by H2O, as
    they could only use Stream 1 funding or their own resources to purchase this
    type of product. INAC was not involved in making decisions regarding purchases. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the point-of-use water
    treatment systems sold by H2O were not major capital projects envisioned by
    Stream 2 funding, which INAC was directly involved in allocating. Referring to
    the testimony of Gail Mitchell, INAC’s Director General of Community
    Infrastructure, the trial judge explained: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the water treatment system contemplated was a centralized or
    municipal system to supply water to the entire community, it would be a major
    project which would fall under the second stream of funding. [Gail Mitchell] confirmed
    that First Nations Bands could not afford to purchase such a system from their annual
    operating fund. The First Nations community seeking this type of system would
    have to submit a proposal to INAC that would then undergo a rigorous review,
    analysis and ranking and then make a decision about whether to proceed with
    that project. Ms. Mitchell indicated that the point-of-use water treatment
    systems marketed by H2O did not fall into this category for funding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent </span>also tried <span
lang=EN-US>to promote pilot projects using H2O’s water treatment systems to
    INAC officials. In November 2010, the respondent first mentioned the prospect
    of a pilot project. In an email, he stated that four communities had been
    identified as potential sites for pilot projects involving H2O’s water
    treatment systems. Later, in February 2011, Mr. Carson wrote to INAC about the
    possibility of another pilot project. The trial judge found that these
    possibilities did not relate to any pilot projects contemplated by INAC. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ultimately, an INAC official told the respondent
    in an email that it was up to individual First Nations to identify their own needs
    and submit project proposals to INAC for funding. The same email referred to a
    partnership between INAC and the Province of Ontario to “evaluate and
    pilot-test drinking water technologies” and indicated that INAC was in the process
    of developing a list of potential technologies and vendors for that project.
    The email explained that the “</span>final technologies/vendors selected for
    evaluation through pilot-testing would be chosen by the Project Team through a
    tendering process that will consider both technical merit and anticipated
    life-cycle cost (LCC). H2O Pros may be on the list of potential vendors invited
    to bid on this pilot-project.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the preliminary hearing, an INAC official
    testified that the pilot project with the Ontario government was only in the
    “conceptual planning stages” at the relevant time. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 121(1)(d) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span lang=EN-US> provides:</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown submitted that “any matter of business
    relating to the government” should be interpreted broadly. It argued that the
    relationship between the government, First Nations and third party suppliers, such
    as H2O, constituted a “three-way business relationship”. The fact that the
    government provided funding to First Nations through INAC was sufficient to capture
    the respondent’s approaches to government as “any matter of business relating
    to the government”, even though INAC </span>is not involved in the purchase of
    the water treatment systems sold by H2O and <span lang=EN-US>First Nations
    could use </span>INAC funding <span lang=EN-US>as they saw fit.  The Crown also
    argued that the respondent’s pursuit of pilot projects on behalf of H2O was a
    matter of business relating to the government because INAC’s approval was required
    for funding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence position was that “any matter of
    business relating to the government” should be read narrowly and should be
    restricted to actual commercial business dealings with the government. The respondent
    submitted that business dealings with entities outside the federal government
    that might receive funding from the government do not fall within the ambit of s.
    121(d) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s decision</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge considered general principles of
    statutory interpretation. She adopted the views of Cunningham A.C.J.S.C.J., as
    he then was, in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R. v. O’Brien</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, [2009] O.J. No. 5817 (S.C.), at para. 52, where he said that s.
    121(1)(d) is directed at preventing influence peddling in order to protect “the
    public’s confidence in the integrity and the appearance of integrity of the government”.
    At paras. 48-49, he explained that “conduct will only fall within the purview
    of s. 121(1)(d) if it is perceived by the Canadian public as blameworthy” and
    that “conduct will be perceived as blameworthy where it gives rise to the
    appearance of dishonesty.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also considered </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>R. v. Hinchey</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1128, which
    dealt with payment to government officials or employees by a person who has
    “dealings with government”, contrary to s. 121(1)(c). At para. 48, L’Heureux-Dubé
    J., writing for the majority, interpreted “dealings with government” in that
    section to be “truly concerned with persons who at the time of the commission
    of the offence had </span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-US>specific or
    ongoing business dealings with the government</span></span><span lang=EN-US>” (emphasis
    added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not accept the Crown’s
    argument that the government, First Nations and H2O were in a three-way business
    relationship. Given the autonomous status of First Nations, she reasoned that
    the mere fact that the government provides funding to an organization does not
    transform persons attempting to do business with those organizations into
    partners with the government. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She concluded that the respondent’s assistance
    to H2O was not in connection with “the transaction of business with or any
    matter of business relating to the government” because there “simply was no
    government business”: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Carson used his influence to set up meetings with INAC
    officials in which he tried to persuade INAC to support H2O as a supplier of
    water treatment systems in reserves. However, he was informed by INAC officials
    that they did not operate in that manner and that the First Nations Bands
    should be the point of contact if they wanted to sell their products to those
    communities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge refused to draw any conclusions
    from the Protocol for Decentralized Water: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Crown’s argument that the Protocol for Decentralized Water
    demonstrated that there was funding that came through INAC for the types of
    water treatment systems marketed by H2O was not supported by the evidence of

    tax treatment for a manufacturer to the detriment of its competitors, might be
    the kind of decision based on influence rather than merit tending to undermine

    or gifts from a person who has “dealings” with the government. In interpreting
    the scope of the term “dealings”, the court recognized at para. 48 that almost
    everyone has dealings with the government, perhaps to apply for </span>licences<span

    employees, like all individuals, may receive personal gifts from time to time,
    quite unrelated to their work. In this context, to avoid criminalizing conduct
    beyond the scope targeted by the legislature L’Heureux-Dubé J. interpreted s.

    “une personne qui a des relations d’affaires avec le gouvernement”, terminology

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of the purposes of s. 121, the context
    and the above textual analysis, the trial judge erred in confining “any matter
    of business related to government” to actual transactions to which the

    had to be a party to the decision to purchase a water treatment system for s.

    promise in exchange for the benefit?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Carson attempted to secure a business

    compliance with the </span><em>Lobbying Act.</em><a href="#_ftn1"

    trial judge found at para. 22 that the respondent told H2O that he “could help
    them by making some important calls in order to connect them with the right
    people to push through their water treatment products to First Nation Bands.” Mr.
    Carson had a lawyer prepare a contract in his girlfriend’s name, which entitled
    her to a commission on sales of H2O’s water treatment systems to First Nations,
    and it was understood that in exchange, he would attempt to influence
    government decisions. The undisputed evidence was that Mr. Carson advocated on
    behalf of H2O as a supplier. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the government did not make any
    particular decision about whether to purchase H2O’s water treatment systems,
    however, the essence of the offence is acceptance of a benefit for exercise of
    influence. Section 121(1) provides that it matters not “whether or not, in
    fact, the official is able to cooperate, render assistance, exercise influence
    or do or omit to do what is proposed.” Accepting a benefit in exchange for
    exercising influence on government officials in order “to push through their
    water treatment products to First Nation Bands” is a “matter of business
    relating to the government.”</span></p>

    Code</em><span lang=EN-US>, for both provisions embrace this conduct. If the
    purpose of the s. 121(1)(d) prohibition is to bar the non-transparent exercise

    may be in some cases that the transparency afforded by compliance with the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague, Pardu J.A. As she
    has explained, the Crown appeals from the respondent’s acquittal on a charge of
    influence peddling contrary to s. 121(1)(d) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among
    other things, s. 121(1)(d) prohibits a person “having or pretending to have
    influence with the government” from accepting, “for themselves or another
    person, a … benefit of any kind as consideration for cooperation, assistance,
    exercise of influence … in connection with [the transaction of business with or
    any matter of business relating to the government].”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the respondent admitted that he was a person with influence with the
    Government of Canada at the relevant time. He also admitted that he demanded a
    benefit for his then girlfriend from a company with whom she was associated as
    consideration for using his government contacts on behalf of the company. The
    respondent denied that his assistance was in connection with a “matter of
    business relating to the government”. Rather, he asserted that it was to obtain
    information about a matter of business relating to First Nation bands.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the evidence, the trial judge concluded that “there simply was no
    government business” involved. Accordingly, she acquitted the respondent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law by misinterpreting s. 121(1)(d);
    by misinterpreting the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence; and by failing to
    give proper legal effect to a government protocol that was admitted at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague would accept the Crown’s submission that the trial judge
    misinterpreted s. 121(1)(d) and would therefore allow the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree that the trial judge misinterpreted s. 121(1)(d) or that she made
    any other error of law. In my view, she found, simply, that the Crown had
    failed to prove that the respondent’s conduct fell within the purview of the
    section.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore dismiss the Crown’s appeal. To explain my reasons, I will set
    out my own summary of the facts and the trial judge’s decision before turning
    to my analysis. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent worked as a senior advisor in the Prime Minister’s Office between
    2006 and 2008, and briefly in 2009.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    leaving the Prime Minister’s office, in February 2010, the respondent met and
    began a romantic relationship with Michele McPherson. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    McPherson met the principals of H20 Professionals Inc., a company that marketed
    and sold point-of-use water treatment systems and water softener systems, and
    had some brief involvement with that company. Point-of-use water treatment
    systems are typically marketed to private homeowners to purify water for use in
    the home. H20 did not sell water treatment systems that would supply clean
    water to an entire community. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    in exchange for a contract that provided commissions to Ms. McPherson on sales
    of water treatment systems to First Nations communities, the respondent agreed
    to help promote H20 products. In doing so, the respondent had various
    interactions with officials from a federal government department then known as
    Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (“INAC”)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a>,
    as well as others, including Ministers and their staff.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    interactions gave rise to the influence peddling charge laid against the
    respondent. In particular, he was charged with being: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>a person having or pretending to have influence with the
    Government of Canada, or with a minister or an official of the Government of
    Canada, [who] did directly or indirectly demand, accept, or agree to accept for
    himself or Michele McPherson, a reward, advantage or benefit as consideration
    for cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence, or acts <span
class=Underline>in connection with a matter of business relating to the
    Government of Canada</span>, contrary to s. 121(1)(d) of the Criminal Code.
    [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a preliminary inquiry, the Crown and the defence agreed that the evidence from
    that proceeding would be admitted as evidence at trial. The Crown did not call
    any additional witnesses at trial but filed as an exhibit one additional
    document that had not been filed at the preliminary inquiry, INAC’s <em>Protocol
    for Decentralized Water and Wastewater Systems in First Nations Communities</em>,
    dated April 15, 2010 (the “Protocol”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the respondent admitted that he was a person who had influence with the
    Government of Canada at the time of the alleged offence. He also admitted that
    he demanded a benefit for Ms. McPherson from H20 in exchange for using his
    government contacts on H20’s behalf.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the respondent denied that his assistance was in connection with “any matter of
    business relating to the government” for the purposes of s. 121(1)(d). Rather,
    he maintained that his interactions with government officials were in
    connection with a matter of business relating to First Nations bands.</p>

  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Trial Judge’s Reasons</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the respondent’s admissions and the manner in which the charge against the
    respondent was framed, the only issue at trial was whether the respondent used
    his influence with the government to obtain a benefit for Ms. McPherson in
    connection with “any matter of business relating to the government.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown argued that there was a three-way business relationship
    between the Crown, First Nations communities and H20. In the Crown’s
    submission, the fact that INAC was the agency providing taxpayers’ money to First
    Nations Bands for their use was sufficient for the respondent’s actions to be
    captured under s. 121(1)(d) as “any matter of business relating to the
    government”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the trial judge reviewed the evidence about INAC funding to First
    Nations communities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence indicated that INAC provides two streams of funding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first stream relates to the operation and maintenance of existing facilities
    and is provided on an annual basis. The funding is formula-driven based on
    various factors, including the size of the community. The First Nations Band or
    community has complete autonomy with respect to how to allocate those funds
    each year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second stream of funding is for capital investments such as building new facilities
    or conducting major renovations to existing facilities. First Nations
    communities can submit proposals to INAC for such funding, and INAC allocates
    funds on the basis of priority, need and risk levels. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence indicated that smaller types of water treatment systems, such as the
    type sold by H20, would be purchased by the First Nations bands from the first
    stream of funding or from resources the community raised on its own.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    there was also some evidence about H20 seeking to participate in a pilot
    project in one or more First Nations communities. The trial judge found this
    evidence to be “somewhat unclear.” She also noted evidence from an INAC
    official that a pilot project that had been in the conceptual stages around the
    time of the respondent’s interactions with INAC officials. However, the
    official confirmed that “it was ultimately up to First Nations Bands to take
    action in either participating in or advancing the project.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the evidence, the positions of the parties, relevant principles of
    statutory interpretation, case law interpreting s. 121, and the purpose of s.
    121, the trial judge embarked on her analysis in a section of her reasons
    entitled “Analysis and Conclusion”. She found that it was “abundantly clear”
    that the respondent was attempting to influence government officials to promote
    H2O’s water treatment systems. Moreover, he had admitted doing so to obtain a
    benefit for his girlfriend. Nonetheless, the evidence supported a finding that
    it was up to individual First Nations communities to determine whether to
    purchase the systems being sold by H20. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted by the trial judge, the testimony of INAC employees indicated that INAC
    did not offer funding to First Nations outside of its first stream of annual
    formula-based funding to purchase the type of product sold by H20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected a Crown submission that because INAC was the funding
    agency for, and an advisor to, First Nations, a three-way business relationship
    was created between the government, First Nations and third-party suppliers
    such as H20. In the trial judge’s view, such a finding would be contrary to
    First Nations’ right to autonomy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on a common sense reading of s. 121(1)(d), and applying the modern rule of statutory
    interpretation, the trial judge concluded that the respondent’s conduct did not
    fall within the purview of s. 121(1)(d). While the respondent had tried to
    persuade INAC employees to support H20 as a vendor to First Nations
    communities, the employees instructed him that they “did not operate in that
    manner” and that the First Nations communities must be his point of contact.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge found that the respondent’s “actions were not in connection
    with ‘the transaction of business with or any matter of business relating to
    the government’ -  there simply was no government business.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge elaborated on these conclusions in the context of the purpose of s.
    121 being to preserve the integrity of the government. She found that the
    government was not in the business of procuring water systems for First Nations
    communities; nor did the government have any authority to approve the systems
    to be purchased. Rather, First Nations communities were autonomous from the
    government in relation to third party vendors such as H20. She said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>In light of my findings that there was no
    business with the government, it follows that the integrity of the government
    was not in issue.</span> I do agree, however, that it was Parliament's intent
    that s. 121(1)(d) … should be applied so as to preserve the integrity of
    government. <span class=Underline>It may also be true that the public</span>,
    viewing [the respondent’s] conduct, <span class=Underline>would believe that
    there was, at the very least, an appearance that his conduct</span> as someone
    with influence with the government <span class=Underline>compromised the
    government's integrity and gave rise to the appearance of dishonesty</span> as
    described … in&nbsp;<em>O'Brien</em>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>However, the difference between&nbsp;<em>O'Brien</em>&nbsp;and
    this case is that <span class=Underline>the government's integrity was never in
    issue here</span> because <span class=Underline>regardless of [the
    respondent’s] attempts to persuade INAC officials to purchase water systems
    from H2O, INAC officials were not in the business of procuring these water
    treatment systems for First Nations communities.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[The respondent] appears to have erroneously believed that the
    government, particularly INAC, was able to assist H2O in selling their water
    treatment products to First Nations communities. He either never understood, or
    chose to ignore the information he received from his contacts at INAC and the [Assembly
    of First Nations]  that they were the wrong entities to engage. <span
class=Underline>Had I found that INAC had the authority to either approve or
    purchase H2O's water treatment systems, beyond the provision of funding to
    First Nations, [the respondent’s] conduct would have been blameworthy</span> and I would have found him guilty of the charge of committing a fraud on the
    government pursuant to s. 121(1)(d).</p>
  <p class=CQuote>However, <span class=Underline>one cannot engage in &quot;the
    transaction of business with or any matter of business relating to the
    government&quot; nor damage the integrity of the government when the government
    is not the entity with which business must be conducted in order to achieve the
    benefit sought. In this case, the evidence supports only one conclusion and
    that is that First Nations communities were autonomous from the government with
    respect to any business transactions with H2O</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also rejected the Crown’s argument that the Protocol demonstrated
    that there was funding that came through INAC for the types of systems marketed
    by H20. She found the argument “was not supported by the evidence of those who
    testified on behalf of INAC. This document was not put to any of them.” In the
    trial judge’s view, it was not possible to afford weight to the Protocol in the
    absence of evidence from an INAC witness concerning how the Protocol operated,
    whether it applied to H20-type water treatment systems and whether it had been
    part of the discussions between the respondent and INAC.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issues &amp; Analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 676(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, the Attorney General may appeal
    against an acquittal “on any ground of appeal that involves a <span
class=Underline>question of law alone</span>” (emphasis added). Thus, the Crown
    is precluded from challenging findings of fact, or findings of mixed fact and
    law, on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law in three respects:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she adopted an overly narrow interpretation of s. 121(1)(a)(iii),
    as incorporated in s. 121(1)(d);</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she misinterpreted the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>she failed to give proper legal effect to the Protocol.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown contends that but for the trial judge’s legal errors, there would have
    been a finding of guilt in this case. It is the Crown’s position that the
    “matter of business relating to the government” to which the respondent’s
    conduct related is government funding of, and funding decisions concerning,
    decentralized water systems in First Nations communities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will address each of the alleged errors relied on by the Crown in turn.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alleged Error #1: Misinterpretation of s. 121</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the trial judge made several errors in interpreting s.
    121(1)(a)(iii), as incorporated in s. 121(1)(d).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Crown says that the trial judge erred in focusing on the phrase
    “transaction of business with … the government”, and ignored the intentionally
    broad language of the phrase “any matter of business relating to the
    government”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Crown argues that the trial judge relied improperly on narrow judicial
    interpretations of other offences created by s. 121 to justify a narrow
    interpretation of s. 121(1)(a)(iii).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Crown submits that the trial judge failed to apply the “modern approach” to
    statutory interpretation by ignoring the broad and specific words used by
    Parliament and reading down the grammatical and ordinary meaning of “any matter
    of business relating to the government” to mean “actual commercial dealings
    with the government”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the Crown maintains that trial judge ignored the concluding language in s. 121(1)(a),
    which makes an official’s ability to “cooperate, render assistance, exercise
    influence or do or omit to do what is proposed, as the case may be” irrelevant
    to the offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the Crown submits that the trial judge’s decision ignores the purpose of the
    section in that it fails to capture “blameworthy” conduct that Parliament
    intended to be captured.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not accept these arguments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the Crown’s submission, in my opinion, the trial judge did not ignore the
    broad language of the phrase “or any matter of business relating to the
    government”; nor did she focus on the phrase “the transaction of business with
    … the government.” Rather, on the evidence before her, the trial judge found
    that “[the respondent’s] actions were not in connection with ‘the transaction
    of business with or any matter of business relating to the government’”. Read
    fairly and in context, her statement “there simply was no government business”
    can only be seen as referring to both elements of s. 121(1)(a)(iii).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in my view, the trial judge did not rely on narrow judicial interpretations of
    other provisions in the scheme of offences created by s. 121 to justify a
    narrow interpretation of s. 121(1)(a)(iii). Before turning to the “Analysis and
    Conclusion” section of her reasons, she quite properly reviewed what little
    case law there is dealing with the interpretation of s. 121 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. While she recognized that none of the cases were directly on point,
    she used them to help inform her understanding of the purpose of s. 121, as discussed
    below.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    I do not agree that the trial judge read down the grammatical and ordinary
    meaning of “any matter of business relating to the government” to mean “actual <span
class=Underline>commercial</span> dealings <span class=Underline>with</span> the government” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    uses the word “commercial” twice in her reasons. At para. 58, she notes the
    defence’s argument that “the phrase in s. 121(1)(d) ‘transaction of business
    with or any matter of business relating to the government’ must be restricted
    to actual commercial business dealings with the government.” She also uses the
    word “commercial” at paragraph 74, in quoting from <em>R. v.</em>&nbsp;<em>Hinchey</em>,&nbsp;[1996]
    3 S.C.R. 1128. There is no mention of the word “commercial” elsewhere in her
    reasons, including in her “Analysis and Conclusion” section. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my reading of
    her reasons, the trial judge found that there was no matter of business
    relating to the government in this case because INAC did not have the authority
    to either approve or purchase H20’s water treatment systems. Had INAC had the
    authority to approve a transaction, the trial judge would have found that there
    was a “matter of business relating to the government”, even though INAC was not
    a party to the transaction. The trial judge did not read s. 121(1)(d) to
    require that the government be a party to any transaction, actual or proposed.
    I therefore reject the Crown’s submission that the trial judge read down the
    section in the manner alleged.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Nor, in my view, did the trial judge err in ignoring the
    closing phrase of s. 121(1)(a). That section makes it an offence to bribe
    officials or their families and the closing phrase stipulates that it is not a
    defence that the official is unable to “cooperate, render assistance, exercise
    influence or do or omit to do what is proposed”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>However, no such closing phrase is included in s.
    121(1)(d). Moreover, I see no basis on which to hold that the fact that s.
    121(1)(d) incorporates sub-paragraphs 121(1)(a)(iii) and (iv) by reference also
    serves to incorporate by reference the closing phrase of s. 121(1)(a). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>As I read s. 121(1)(a), the closing phrase is not an integral
    part of sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv); rather, sub-paragraphs (iii) and (iv)
    stand alone. Section 121(1)(d)(i) refers specifically to subparagraphs (a)(iii)
    and (iv); it makes no mention of the closing phrase of s. 121(1)(a), or the
    remainder of that subsection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Further, if the closing phrase of s. 121(1)(a) were to be
    incorporated into s. 121(1)(d), it would have to be modified to fit the
    different context. While s. 121(1)(a) deals with bribes to officials and their
    families, s. 121(1)(d) deals with influencing officials or ministers. Thus, if
    the closing phrase were to apply in the context of s. 121(1)(d), it would have
    to read  “whether or not, in fact, the official <span class=Underline>or Minister</span> is able to cooperate…”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>I would also reject the Crown’s submission that the trial
    judge’s decision ignores the purpose of s. 121(1)(d) in that it fails to
    capture “blameworthy” conduct that Parliament intended to be captured. The
    trial judge acknowledged that the purpose of s. 121 is to preserve the
    integrity and appearance of integrity of the government. However, on the facts
    of this case, she found that “the government’s integrity was never in issue”.
    This was because INAC officials were not in the business of procuring water
    treatment systems for First Nations communities; nor did they have authority to
    approve them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>As for the Crown’s reliance on an isolated passage from
    the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>R. v.</em> <em>Giguère</em>, [1983] 2
    S.C.R. 448, I would simply note that the issue in <em>Giguère</em> was not the proper
    interpretation of the phrase “the transaction of business with or any matter of
    business relating to the government.” The passage on which the Crown relies
    does not address that question.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Before concluding on this issue, I note that my colleague
    contends that the “gravamen of the offence under s. 121(1)(d) is the acceptance
    of a benefit in exchange for a promise to influence government or assistance,
    whether or not any transaction results.” I do not agree with this
    characterization. Among other things, it ignores the essential requirement that
    “cooperation, assistance, exercise of influence or an act or omission” must be
    in connection with “the transaction of <span class=Underline>business with</span> or <span class=Underline>any matter of business relating to the government</span>”
    (emphasis added). A promise to influence the government can only meet that
    criterion if the promise is in connection with “the transaction of <span
class=Underline>business with</span> or <span class=Underline>any matter of
    business relating to the government”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the result, I am not persuaded that the trial judge
    erred in law in interpreting s. 121(1)(a)(iii) as incorporated in 121(1)(d). Absent
    an error of law alone, it is not open to this court to overturn an acquittal. I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alleged Error #2: Misinterpretation of the <em>Actus Reus</em> of the
    Offence</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The Crown points to para. 76 of the trial judge’s reasons,
    where she said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Subsection 121(1)(a)(ii) of the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code</em>&nbsp;includes
    the same language as s. 121(1)(d), (both make reference to s. 121(1)(a)(iii)).
    The difference between the two sections is that s. 121(1)(a)(ii) applies to
    government officials who commit a fraud against the government whereas
    subsection 121(1) (d) applies to anyone &quot;having or pretending to have
    influence with the government&quot;. <span class=Underline>On the facts of
    both&nbsp;Cogger&nbsp;and this case, for the accused to be found guilty he must
    have engaged in &quot;the transaction of business with or any matter of
    business relating to the government</span>&quot;. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The Crown submits that by including the words “he must
    have engaged in” prior to the final phrase, the trial judge imposed an
    additional conduct requirement where none exists. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Similar language appears in para. 98, where the trial
    judge states:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>However, one cannot engage in &quot;the transaction of business
    with or any matter of business relating to the government&quot; nor damage the
    integrity of the government when the government is not the entity with which
    business must be conducted in order to achieve the benefit sought.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    judge’s reasons as a whole, in my view, it is clear that the trial judge did
    not create an additional conduct requirement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In paragraph 76, the trial judge was discussing the
    differences between the offences in <em>R. v. Cogger</em>,<em> </em>[1997] 2
    S.C.R. 845, and that alleged against the respondent. </p>

class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In para. 98, the trial judge was focused on the impact of

class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>A full reading of the trial judge’s reasons reveals that

    respondent was assisting H20 in a “matter of business relating to the
    government.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>As indicated above, the evidence from the preliminary
    inquiry was incorporated into the trial on consent. However, the Protocol was
    not filed as an exhibit at the preliminary inquiry. Rather, the Crown filed it
    as an exhibit at trial on consent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In her reasons, at paras. 46–50, the trial judge reviewed
    the evidence relating to the Protocol. Ultimately, however, since it had not
    been put to the INAC witnesses who testified, in the absence of their evidence
    on a document that could have been put to them, the trial judge declined to put
    any weight on it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>On appeal, the Crown attempts to formulate the trial
    judge’s assessment of this evidence as some form of legal error. I reject this
