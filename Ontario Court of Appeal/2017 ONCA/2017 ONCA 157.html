    pending the hearing of an appeal to this court from the dismissal by the
    Superior Court of Justice of her appeal from a decision of the initial
    application judge making her son a Crown ward, without access. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She submits that there is a serious issue to be
    determined on appeal – namely, whether the Superior Court appellate judgment
    and the decision of the application judge were correct – and that irreparable
    harm may occur if access is not continued. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Z.A.F. was apprehended by the respondent Children’s
    Aid Society on July 27, 2013 at about eight weeks of age and has remained in
    the care of the same foster parents since that date, about three and a half
    years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Society subsequently brought a protection application
    in the Ontario Court of Justice under Part III of the </span><em>Child and
    Family Services Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (“CFSA”), which
    was heard between May and June of 2015.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following a twelve-day trial, in reasons for
    judgment released December 1, 2015, the application judge made an order of
    Crown wardship with no access by either the father or the mother. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge found that Z.A.F. was in
    need of protection. She accepted the expert testimony that the quality of the
    appellant’s parenting was hampered by her mental health issues, which made the
    appellant lack insight into Z.A.F.’s emotional and developmental needs. The
    appellant had also exposed Z.A.F. to adult conflict and domestic between her
    and her partners.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge also reviewed some of the expert
    evidence about the bond between the appellant and Z.A.F. She found that,
    although there was some level of affection expressed, there was no strong emotional
    bond between them, and the appellant at times exhibited emotional removal or
    detachment from Z.A.F.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given these difficulties, as well as the
    unlikelihood that the appellant would make the changes necessary to become a
    successful parent and lacked significant community or family support, the application
    judge found that a supervision order would not adequately protect the child.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After concluding that the child’s best interests
    required a Crown wardship order, the application judge held that there was no
    basis for an access order. Z.A.F. lived in the care of foster parents for most
    of his life, and there was no evidence that the relationship between K.F. or
    her partner was meaningful or beneficial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appealed this decision to the
    Superior Court of Justice. She brought a motion for a stay pending that appeal,
    as well as an order for access pending the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 22, 2016, the Superior Court motion
    judge  ordered interim access pending the appeal for two hours once a week, to
    be monitored by the Society until disposal of the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This access continued until the mother’s appeal
    was dismissed by The Superior Court appeal judge on January 3, 2017. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal judge concluded, at para. 21 of his
    reasons, that “the trial judge was correct in her decision; made the reasonable
    and proper inferences and findings based upon all of the evidence before her;
    and that such inferences and findings were reasonably drawn thereon; and that
    she made no palpable nor overriding error in fact; and was correct in her
    interpretation of the law.” On the appeal, the appellant’s argument was
    essentially that the trial judge should have made different findings of fact. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal judge dealt with the issue of access
    following an order for Crown wardship at paras. 28 and 33-35: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>This issue was argued at trial and the field “re-plowed” at the
    appeal hearing. Despite certain further evidence being allowed and considered
    at the Appeal Hearing and despite the Agency filing uncontroverted (or even
    challenged) evidence regarding the quality of or impact upon Z.A.F. of
    continued, weekly, supervised access to the Appellant, no new (or any) evidence
    was offered by the Appellant that access was either “meaningful or beneficial”
    to Z.A.F.. It was argued by Agency counsel that continued access did indeed
    impair the child’s opportunity for adoption (despite the 2011 amendments to
    the&nbsp;<em>Act</em>). I agree with this submission.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, the trial judge carefully considered the
    evidence, the submissions, applied the legislation and addressed the s. 59(2.1)
    criteria and came to an appropriate decision.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>No new evidence was offered on this issue other than counsel’s
    ingenious speculation that weekly access (since the Sloan J. Order of February
    22, 2016) has created in his mind a routine, so therefore continued access must
    be “meaningful” to Z.A.F.. Despite that “leap”, even if it were logical, it is
    refuted by the further evidence of the Agency workers regarding the nature of
    Z.A.F.’s behaviour (and K.F.’s) during the imposed access visits.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>On the evidence, I find that continued access is neither
    meaningful nor beneficial to Z.F. and entirely impairs and obstructs Z.A.F.’s
    possible placement for adoption. It is not in his interest (“best” or
    “otherwise”) to continue that invasion into his life.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was a good-bye visit between the K.F. and
    Z.A.F. on January 9, 2017. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 59(2.1) of the CFSA sets out the
    conditions which must be satisfied before an access order can be made in favour
    of a parent, following an order for Crown wardship:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong>Access: Crown ward</strong></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2.1) A court shall not make or vary an access order
    made under section 58 with respect to a Crown ward unless the court is
    satisfied that,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) the relationship between the person and the
    child is beneficial and meaningful to the child; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) the ordered access will not impair the child’s
    future opportunities for adoption.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    a decision is made for Crown wardship, the burden of persuading a court that an
    access order should be made, and that the statutory conditions are met, is on
    the parent seeking access: see <em>Catholic Children’s Aid Society of
    Metropolitan Toronto v. M. (C.),</em> [1994] 2 S.C.R. 165, at p. 207; and <em>Children’s
    Aid Society of Toronto v. P. (D.)</em> (2006), 19 R.F.L. (6th) 267 (Ont. C.A.),
    at para. 8.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is of course a very serious matter for the appellant to have had a Crown
    wardship order made without access to her child. I am not persuaded, however,
    that there is a substantial ground of appeal raised in this court. Again, the appellant
    takes issue with the factual findings made by the trial application judge and
    the appeal judge on the fresh evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have examined the appellant’s Notice of Appeal in this court. She requests that
    the child be placed with her subject only to a six-month supervision order. It
    is difficult to see how that relief could be granted in the circumstances of
    this case. She asks in the alternative that the child be placed with an 18-year-old
    sibling. This was not advanced at trial. She raises constitutional arguments
    suggesting that various sections of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CFSA</span></em><em> </em>are void on the ground they violate rights guaranteed by the <em>Charter</em>.
    These arguments were not advanced at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that the appellant’s onus to show that there are serious issues raised
    by the appeal is not a heavy one, but I do have difficulty in concluding that
    there is arguable merit in one of more of the grounds of her appeal. I
    recognize that a motion such as this does not permit a full examination of the
    grounds of appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are findings by two judges that no order for access should be made on the
    ground that the mother had not shown that the relationship between the person
    and the child is beneficial and meaningful to the child. A decision whether to
    grant access pending appeal must be based on the best interests of the child. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    has been a good-bye visit. Only a month has elapsed since then. Should access
    be resumed until this appeal is heard and decided?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have reviewed the fresh evidence that was before the appeal judge describing in
    detail the interaction between the mother and her child during the weekly two
    hour access visits. I am not persuaded that those visits are in the child’s
    best interests or that the child will suffer irreparable harm if there is no
    access until this appeal is decided. This court gives priority to appeals from
    decisions making Crown wardship orders and this appeal should be able to be
    heard within months. All transcripts have been prepared. In the event the
    appellant succeeds on appeal in obtaining an order for access to her child, I
    am not satisfied that a resumption of access would be traumatic for the child
    given the nature of their relationship. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the motion for access to the child pending the hearing of the
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
