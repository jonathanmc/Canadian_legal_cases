  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on December 5,
    2014, by Justice Anne Mullins of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Gillese J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A Rogers Wireless store was robbed.  Shortly
    afterwards, Rheal Michel Hamilton (the “appellant”) was arrested in connection
    with the robbery.  He was placed in the back of a police cruiser.  After having
    been read his rights to counsel, the appellant told the arresting officer that
    he wanted to speak to duty counsel.  Despite that, the officer continued to
    question him.  The appellant answered by giving an exculpatory statement about his
    whereabouts shortly before the robbery (the “First Statement”).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the police station, the appellant spoke by
    telephone with duty counsel for four or five minutes.  Approximately an hour
    and a half later, the appellant was interviewed by a different police officer. 
    During the interview, the appellant acknowledged that duty counsel had advised
    him not to speak to the police.  The interviewing officer also advised the
    appellant of his right to silence.  However, he did not tell the appellant that
    nothing the appellant had already said to the police should in any way affect
    his decision whether to speak with them at that time.  Over the course of the
    interview, the appellant gave substantially the same exculpatory statement as
    he had before (the “Second Statement”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and his co-accused were tried
    together on charges arising from the robbery.  The trial took place before a
    judge and jury. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A pre-trial <i>voir dire </i>was conducted
    concerning the admissibility of statements that each of the accused had given
    to the police.  The trial judge admitted the Second Statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified at trial and advanced an
    alibi that was consistent with the Second Statement except that he said that,
    just prior to the robbery, he had been with his spouse as opposed to a woman
    named Sasha.      </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The jury found the appellant guilty of all
    charges against him (robbery, using an imitation firearm in the commission of
    an indictable offence, unlawful confinement, and wearing a disguise with intent
    to commit an indictable offence).  He was sentenced to a net term of 27 months
    and 10 days’ imprisonment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He appeals against conviction on the basis that
    the trial judge should not have admitted the Second Statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal, quash the convictions and order a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND IN BRIEF</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At approximately 9:05 p.m. on November 23, 2011,
    three men robbed a Rogers Wireless store in Vaughan, Ontario.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Exterior security footage from a Tim Hortons
    restaurant in the same plaza as the Rogers store showed the appellant walking
    across the parking lot approximately ten minutes after the robbery had ended. 
    A short while later, a bystander reported to the police that someone had been
    seen running west along Highway 7.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Police Constable McCallum drove along the
    highway and saw the appellant in the plaza of a Wendy’s restaurant.  PC
    McCallum thought that the appellant matched the description of one of the
    suspects that had been aired over police radio, so he detained him.  He asked
    the appellant where he was coming from and the appellant replied, “Tim
    Hortons”.  PC McCallum searched the appellant for weapons, and told him that he
    was investigating an armed robbery at the Rogers store. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was then turned over to PC Armas,
    who had arrived in his own cruiser just behind PC McCallum.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At 9:23 p.m., PC Armas arrested the appellant
    and placed him in the rear of his police cruiser.  Approximately eight minutes
    after his arrest, PC Armas apprised the appellant of his rights to counsel.  After
    having been cautioned, the appellant indicated that he understood the information
    that he had been given.  He also told PC Armas that he wanted to speak with
    duty counsel.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless, PC Armas continued to question the
    appellant.  The appellant made the First Statement to PC Armas, most of which
    was in response to questions by PC Armas after the appellant had indicated that
    he wanted to talk to duty counsel.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The essence of the appellant’s First Statement
    was that he had been taking the bus to Toronto along Highway 7 from his home in
    Brampton with a woman named Sasha Costello; they had argued; he had left the
    bus and was on his way to Wendy’s when he was detained by the police.      </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant arrived at the police station with
    PC Armas shortly before 10 p.m.  Shortly after midnight, the appellant spoke privately
    with duty counsel, by telephone, for four or five minutes.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At approximately 1:45 a.m., the appellant was
    taken to an interview room, where DC Abreu questioned him.  The interview lasted
    until 3:36 a.m, with several breaks.  It was recorded by video and supervised
    by another officer.  During the interview, DC Abreu advised the appellant of
    his right to silence. But, he did not tell the appellant that his decision
    whether to speak with them should not be influenced by anything the appellant had
    already told the police </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>DC Abreu testified that although he expected to
    be briefed about any statements that the appellant had made to other police
    officers before he interviewed the appellant, at the time of that interview, he
    was unaware of the First Statement.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During his interview with DC Abreu, the
    appellant made the Second Statement, which was substantially similar to his
    First Statement.  He said that he and Sasha had been taking the York Region Transit
    #77 bus along Highway 7 and were travelling to Sasha’s home in Toronto. 
    However, after they got into a fight he got off the bus at the stop in front of
    the plaza in which the Tim Hortons was located.  He said that he first went
    into the Tim Hortons but changed his mind and, while he was walking down the
    road to Wendy’s, he was arrested.     </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During the interview, the appellant mentioned
    several times to DC Abreu that he was repeating what he had already told the
    police.  For instance, when DC Abreu asked the appellant what he had been doing
    in Vaughan, the appellant began his answer by saying, “I already talked to them
    about that”.  The appellant then told PC Abreu what he had previously told PC
    Armas, namely, that he had been taking the bus with a friend.  When DC Abreu
    asked for the friend’s name, the appellant replied, “Sasha. I already gave that
    to the police.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>THE IMPUGNED RULING </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown brought a pre-trial motion in which it
    sought to adduce the Second Statement in order to discredit the appellant’s
    story as a fabrication and to invite the jury to infer consciousness of guilt. 
    The Crown did not seek to adduce the First Statement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence conceded the voluntariness of the
    statements and brought its own application to have the statements excluded on <i>Charter </i>grounds.  In that application, the appellant maintained that PC Armas had
    infringed his s.10(<i>b</i>) rights by continuing to question him after he had
    indicated his wish to speak with duty counsel and that the Second Statement was
    tainted.  He submitted that both statements should be excluded under s. 24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i>.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the pre-trial <i>voir dire</i> was conducted,
    both Crown and defence counsel mistakenly believed that the First Statement had
    not been audio-recorded. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>voir
    dire</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, in a ruling dated October 21, 2014 (the
    “Original Ruling”), the trial judge ruled that the Second Statement was admissible. 
    She began by considering the voluntariness of the statements.  She concluded
    the voluntariness section of her analysis at para. 55 of her reasons, saying:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[55] Assuming for these analytic purposes, [the
    appellant’s] utterances at the scene were involuntary, and obtained in
    circumstances of a breach of his <i>Charter </i>rights, the admissibility of
    his [Second Statement] must be assessed on the basis of a number of factual
    determinations. These include the time between the [First Statement] and the [Second
    Statement], any advertence to the [First Statement], the presence or not of the
    same officers, and any other similarities of circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The validity of the trial judge’s reasons for
    admitting the Second Statement is in issue in this appeal.  Thus, I set them out
    below.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading align=center style='text-align:center'><u><span lang=EN-US>Tainting
    – Mr. Hamilton [the appellant]</span></u></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[56] In the case of <i>R. v. I &amp; T</i>,
    jurisprudence is cited that confirms that there is no hard and fast rule.
    Tainting of a statement may be found if the same disqualifying circumstances
    are considered to be prevalent in the second statement, as were present at the
    first statement. Or that the evidence establishes that a first statement is a
    substantial contributing factor to the making of the second.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[57] Here the defence submits that Mr.
    Hamilton’s [Second Statement] was tainted in that utterances attributed to him
    by Officer Armas to the effect that he was coming from Tim Hortons, that he had
    traveled by bus, that he was intending to visit a girlfriend, and/or was accompanied
    by that girlfriend, must have preyed on Mr. Hamilton’s mind during the giving
    of his formal statement while interviewed by Officer Abreu. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[58] When the specific examples that are cited
    by the defence are considered, those at pages 14, 9 to 10, 18 to 19, 22, 33 and
    36 to 37, and having viewed the video-recorded statement, this is simply not
    borne out. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[59] Officer Abreu related to Mr. Hamilton
    during the video-recorded statement that witnesses had observed him running
    towards Wendy’s from Tim Hortons. Mr. Hamilton was not confronted with any
    allegation of having made a statement to any other officer as to his presence
    at Tim Hortons. Likewise, Mr. Hamilton’s account of having been on a bus
    intending to visit a friend is not prompted by any assertions to him, of having
    recounted this previously to any other officer. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[60] In short, there is no demonstrable
    relationship between any utterance earlier made by Mr. Hamilton and his [Second
    Statement] that can be discerned as having subverted his choice to speak or not
    with Officer Abreu.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[61] Since the Crown is not seeking to tender
    the utterances of Mr. Hamilton that preceded his video-recorded statement, I
    need not make a ruling as to their voluntariness, nor given my finding that
    there was no taint of the latter by the former, need I make a ruling that
    excludes any earlier utterances from being given in evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When counsel subsequently discovered that an

    and made the same error that this court identified in <i>R. v. Plaha </i>(2004),
    188 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.).  He contends that a proper consideration of

    The Crown contends that if there was a breach of the appellant’s rights in

    Thereafter, I apply the <i>Plaha </i>test to the present case and show why the

    they failed to tell the accused that he was not obliged to speak with them and

    should have been excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.      </span></p>

    that if the impugned statement was considered in isolation from the earlier
    statements, there was no <i>Charter </i>violation and, hence, no question of
    excluding it under s. 24(2).  However, the impugned statement could not be
    considered in isolation.  Its admissibility had to be resolved under s. 24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i>: <i>Plaha</i>, at para. 42.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Doherty J.A. explained that there are two
    components to the s. 24(2) analysis.  The first is a threshold requirement: was
    the impugned statement obtained in a manner that infringed a <i>Charter </i>right? 
    If that threshold is crossed, one turns to the second “evaluative” component of
    s. 24(2) to determine whether the admission of the impugned evidence would
    bring the administration of justice into disrepute: <i>Plaha</i>, at para. 44.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A generous approach is to be taken to the
    threshold issue. As Doherty J.A. explains at para. 45 of <i>Plaha</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>A causal relationship between the breach and
    the impugned evidence is not necessary. The evidence will be “obtained in a
    manner” that infringed a <i>Charter </i>right if on a review of the entire
    course of events, the breach and the obtaining of the evidence can be said to
    be part of the same transaction or course of conduct. The connection between
    the breach and the obtaining of the evidence may be temporal, contextual,
    causal or a combination of the three. The connection must be more than tenuous: <i>R. v. Goldhart</i> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), at 492-497. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A temporal connection between the <i>Charter </i>breach
    and the subsequent obtaining of a statement will usually suffice to bring the
    statement within the ambit of s. 24(2).  The measurement of the temporal
    connection is more than simply counting the minutes or hours between the two. 
    Events that occur during the time interval can colour the significance of the passage
    of time: <i>Plaha</i>, at paras. 48-49.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Doherty J.A. found that the temporal connection
    in <i>Plaha </i>was made out.  The accused made the impugned statement some six
    and a half hours after the last violation of his right to counsel.  The “mere
    ticking of the unheard clock” could not distance the impugned statement from
    the earlier events because during the intervening period, the accused had been
    sitting by himself in a small interview room and was under the “total control”
    of the authorities: <i>Plaha</i>, at para. 49. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He also found that there was a contextual
    connection between the impugned statement and the earlier ones; the second,
    third and fourth statements were taken in the same place, by the same two
    police officers, using the same approach: <i>Plaha</i>, at para. 51.  </span></p>

    co-accused (Original Ruling, at para. 45), even though defence counsel for the
    appellant had conceded that voluntariness was not in issue in respect of the
    First and Second Statements and had framed his application exclusively in terms
    of the <i>Charter</i>.   </span></p>

    Statement was tainted, the trial judge referred only to <i>R. v. I. (L.R.) and
    T. (E.), </i>[1993] 4 S.C.R. 504, which addresses the admissibility of
    statements under the common law rules relating to confessions.  The trial judge
    did not set out or allude to the <i>Plaha </i>test for determining whether,
    when the police have obtained a statement in violation of s. 10(<i>b</i>), and
    the suspect gives a second statement after having consulted a lawyer, the
    second statement was “obtained in a manner” that infringed the <i>Charter</i>.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the trial judge’s analysis focused
    entirely on whether the Second Statement was causally linked to the First

    between the two statements.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As para. 45 of <i>Plaha </i>(set out above) makes
    clear, a causal relationship between the breach and the Second Statement was
    not necessary.  However, the trial judge had to determine whether there was a
    temporal, contextual or causal link, or some combination of all three, between
    the First and Second Statements such that the Second Statement could be said to
    be part of the same transaction or course of conduct.  The sufficiency of the
    connection between the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Charter</span></em><i><span

    be determined only by a case-specific factual inquiry: </span><em><span

    judge did not undertake such an inquiry.          </span></p>

    expressed a wish to see a lawyer, PC Armas continued to question the appellant. 
    His failure to hold off further questioning until the appellant had spoken to
    counsel was a breach of the appellant’s s. 10(<i>b</i>) rights: <i>R. v.

    whether the Second Statement was tainted, the court must review the entire
    course of events from the breach to the Second Statement to determine whether
    the Second Statement can be said to be part of the same transaction or course
    of conduct.  In its review, the court must consider the connection between the
    breach and the obtaining of the Second Statement.  The connection may be temporal,
    contextual or causal, or some combination of the three but it must be more than
    tenuous (<i>Plaha</i>, at para. 45).  </span></p>

    separation in time between the appellant’s two statements than there was in <i>Plaha</i>.
     In <i>Plaha, </i>six and a half hours passed between the earlier statements
    and the making of the impugned statement.  In this case, the Second Statement
    was made four hours after the First Statement.  And, just as in <i>Plaha</i>,
    apart from the brief period of his telephone conversation with duty counsel,
    the appellant passed his time between the making of the two statements under
    the total control of the authorities.  Thus, the passage of a few hours between
    the breach and the Second Statement could not distance the latter from it.   </span></p>

    contextual link between the appellant’s two statements.  From the appellant’s
    perspective, DC Abreu’s interrogation was a continuation of PC Armas’ earlier
    questioning.  Although DC Abreu never confronted the appellant with his
    statement to PC Armas, the appellant noted several times that he was repeating

    In support of this contention, the Crown points to the following: the appellant

    judge’s ultimate determination: <i>Grant</i>, at para. 86.  In this case, such deference
    is not owed to the trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis because she failed to
    consider the s. 10(<i>b</i>) violation of the appellant’s rights by PC Armas

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The third inquiry focusses on the public interest
    in having the case tried fairly on its merits.  This may lead to consideration
    of the reliability of the evidence.  Just as involuntary confessions are
    suspect on grounds of reliability, so may, on occasion, be statements taken in
    contravention of the <i>Charter</i>.  Detained by the police and without a
    lawyer, a suspect may make statements to the police that are based more on a
    misconceived idea of how to get out of his or her predicament than on the
    truth.  This danger, where present, undercuts the argument that the illegally
    obtained statement is necessary for a trial of the merits.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this passage from <i>Grant</i>, the Supreme
    Court explains that a suspect detained by the police and without a lawyer may
    make statements based on a misconceived idea of how to escape their
    predicament, rather than on the truth of those statements.  Where that danger
    is present, as indicated in the foregoing quotation from <i>Grant</i>, it undercuts
    the argument that admission of the statements is necessary for a trial of the
    merits.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, the First Statement was
    taken in contravention of the appellant’s <i>Charter </i>rights and the Second
    Statement was tainted by the First Statement.  Thus, the danger described in

    concern about the reliability of the statements.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, and in any event, the Crown was not
    relying on the Second Statement for its truth.  It sought to have the Second
    Statement admitted so that it could establish its falsity in support of an inference
    of consciousness of guilt. That inference was contested because, while the
    appellant acknowledged that he had lied to the police, he denied having done so
    in order to conceal his guilt.  In the circumstances, it seems self-evident
    that the Second Statement was not reliable within the meaning of the third <i>Grant </i>factor. </span></p>
