    involves whether the trial judge committed a jurisdictional error in signing a
    new Warrant of Committal four months after sentencing the appellant to correct
    an apparent mathematical error. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>BACKGROUND</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The appellant,
    Roman Krouglov, was convicted of aggravated sexual assault, sexual
    interference, assault with a weapon, and assault and uttering a death threat. 
    All charges related to one victim.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The aggravated
    sexual assault and the sexual interference counts arose out of the appellant’s
    sexual relationship with the victim when she was 15 and 16 years old.  The
    appellant was nine years older.  The appellant knew he was HIV positive.  He
    did not disclose his status to the victim.  He had unprotected sex with her
    over an extended period of time before finally disclosing his HIV positive
    status to the victim.  The appellant and the victim continued their sexual
    relationship after the disclosure and she ultimately contracted HIV.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    admitted to having “terrorized” the victim during the relationship. The balance
    of the convictions stems from an incident in February 2014, when he choked the
    victim, held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    to sentence, the Crown sought a global sentence of six to seven years. The
    defence argued that the appellant should be given credit for 29.25 months of
    pre-sentence custody (19.5 months were actually served) and that no further
    period of custody should be imposed. </span></p>

    the following as aggravating factors:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>…. The prior criminal record, marked as Exhibit Number 3 on
    sentence. On the aggravated sexual assault count, the fact that the victim was
    a minor and the nine-year difference in their ages. The breach of trust in
    failing to inform the complainant, the victim, of his H.I.V. status. The
    accused's deliberate disregard for safe sexual practices in relation to his
    H.I.V. illness, despite counselling prior to these offences. The fact that the
    accused used drugs as part of his manipulation of the complainant, including
    the use of heroin within the first month or two of their relationship. The
    accused's lack of remorse, lack of appreciation of the gravity of the offence
    and his indifference to the impact of the offence on the victim. The impact of
    the offences upon the complainant as detailed in the presentence report.</p>

    mitigating factors, the trial judge referred to the fact that the accused had
    spent 19.5 months in pre-sentence custody.  He had a history of drug addiction.
    He had the support of his family. He was intelligent.  There was potential for
    rehabilitation.  The trial judge also observed that although the accused did
    transmit HIV to the victim, the evidence was unclear as to whether the
    transmission took place before or after the victim was aware of his status.  </span></p>

    expressed the view that the facts, particularly the actual transmission of HIV
    and the vulnerability of the victim, placed the appropriate sentence “closest
    to the cases where sentences of five years or more had been imposed.”  </span></p>

    noted that the accused lived in a luxury condominium and drove an expensive
    car.  He provided drugs to the victim. The trial judge described how the combination
    of what the accused offered the victim and the victim’s difficult home life led
    her to respond quickly to the accused’s overtures.  Relying on <em><span

200%'>he trial judge found that the accused was in a position of trust in
    relation to the victim.  He concluded that the accused’s “manipulation of the
    [victim] and the toxic relationship that resulted, ultimately had terrible
    life-long consequences for the victim”. The trial judge further found that the accused
    lacked insight and remorse and was “entirely self-focused and apparently
    unconcerned about his responsibility for these offences and the impact they
    have had on the victim.”  The trial judge further found that the accused posed
    a high-risk to reoffend.  </span></p>

    the fairness of the procedure followed to correct a perceived mistake will be
    an important consideration.  The passage of time between the court’s original
    decision and the proposed correction is a relevant factor, although time is not
    the only factor that can compromise the appearance or reality of trial
    fairness.  Here, the appellant notes the following aspects of the process followed
    which, in his submission, compromised the appearance or reality of trial
    fairness:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge issued a judgment that was internally
    inconsistent as to the sentence (paras. 32 and 33), but signed an Information
    and three times signed a Warrant of Committal that indicated that the sentence
    imposed was one of 66 months (consistent with para. 33).</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Four months later, CSC discovered the inconsistency in the

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was no hearing before the trial judge on the issue.</p>

    the appellant argues that the complete exclusion of defence counsel or the
    appellant from the process cannot be defended.  The appellant submits that the
    Crown’s argument to the contrary depends on finding that the trial judge’s
    intention was manifest and therefore, in issuing a new Warrant of Committal, he
    was engaged in a “non-judicial function” that did not require all parties to be
    consulted.  The appellant argues that, on this record, the trial judge’s
    intentions were not manifest.  He says it is equally possible that the error in
    the reasons for sentence resides in para. 32 (where the trial judge indicated a
    global sentence of 6.5 years) and not in para. 33 (where the trial judge noted
    the global sentence as 66 months).  Because there was no hearing on the matter,
    it is impossible to know whether the trial judge had a clear memory of the case
    and his intention, if he refreshed his memory somehow, or if he relied on the
    communication from the CSC to establish his intention.  The fact that the trial
    judge signed the new Warrant of Committal endorsing a 78 month sentence is not evidence
    of his intention.</span></p>

    submits that issuing the new Warrant of Committal to correspond to the sentence
    as initially pronounced by the trial judge was not in error because it was a
    correction that did not involve exercise of a judicial function.  Rather, it was
    a reflection of the trial judge’s intention as demonstrated by both a plain
    reading of the reasons for sentence and the trial judge’s subsequent conduct.  When
    the trial judge was made aware that the conversion to months did not match up
    with the statement of the total sentence in years, he did not need to engage in
    any weighing of factors, reconsideration of analysis or application of legal
    principles.  All he needed to do was correct the mathematical error he had made
    in converting years to months.  In so doing he was exercising an administrative
    not a judicial function.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The respondent
    submits that it is manifestly apparent that the trial judge intended to sentence
    the appellant to a term of 6.5 years in custody less credit for pre-sentence
    custody.  The transcript of the reasons for sentence makes this clear.  The trial
    judge made a simple mathematical error – 6.5 years was mistakenly converted to
    66 months. </span></p>

    further submits that had there been any doubt about judicial intention, it is
    cleared up entirely by the judge’s subsequent response to the CSC inquiry.  The
    communications between the trial judge and court staff indicates his
    acknowledgment of the mathematical error. </span></p>

    fairness, the respondent argues that the error correction was not so long after
    the original sentencing so as to cause the appellant any injustice.  His appeal
    was already underway and his statutory release date was not yet reached.  He had
    not been granted parole. </span></p>

    fairly admits that it would have been preferable to notify defence counsel so
    that the error would be corrected with submissions, or at least with advance
    notice to both parties.  However, the respondent points out that there would have
    been no submissions of any import to make, given the trial judge’s clear
    intention to impose a custodial term of 6.5 years.  Had the parties been
    brought together, the result would have been no different. </span></p>

    alone criminal trials. A jury can make an error in recording a verdict; so can

    6.5 years in custody, less credit for his pre-sentence custody.  It follows
    that the trial judge’s mathematical error in converting 6.5 years into months
    does not render his intention ambiguous.  The fact that this error was copied

    clear that para. 32 of the reasons for sentence is the paragraph in which the trial
    judge issued his sentence.  The paragraph starts with the phrase: “Mr.
    Krouglov, you will be sentenced as follows.”  The trial judge then immediately proceeded
    to break down the sentence per count: five years on the aggravated sexual
    assault, one year consecutive on the sexual interference with a person under
    the age of 16, and six months on each of the assault with a weapon, assault and
    uttering death threats, concurrent to each other, but consecutive to the first
    two counts. Adding these sentences together, the sentence is 6.5 years.  The
    trial judge reinforced this global sentence by explicitly stating at the end of
    the paragraph, “…for a total of six and a half years.”</span></p>
