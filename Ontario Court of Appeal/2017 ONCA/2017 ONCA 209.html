  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on June 29, 2015 by
    Justice K.N. Barnes of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Heading>By the Court:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals his convictions for historical
    sexual assault and sexual exploitation against the complainant, D.I. These
    offences occurred from 1988 to 1991, when D.I. was between 13 and 16 years old,
    and the appellant was his Big Brother. In particular, among other incidents, the
    trial judge found that the appellant had sexually assaulted and exploited D.I. when
    he brought him to the house of the appellant’s sister.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant advances two main grounds of appeal:  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge erred in admitting records from the Big
    Brothers organization concerning his relationship with D.I., for the truth of their
    contents, and in allowing the Crown to split its case by filing them in reply after
    the close of the appellant’s defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s reasons were inadequate because he
    failed to explain why he rejected the corroborating evidence of the appellant’s
    sister, which should have left the trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to
    the appellant’s guilt.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Admission of Big Brothers Records</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the parties’ agreement, the trial judge admitted the Big
    Brothers records as <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the truth of their
    contents and allowed the Crown to file them in reply. In particular, the trial
    judge accepted the dates in the records as to when the relationship between the
    appellant and D.I. began and ended, in preference to the appellant’s evidence
    and in corroboration of D.I.’s evidence. For the reasons that follow, we see no
    error in the trial judge’s admission and reliance on the records for this
    purpose.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a statutory exception to the hearsay rule, s. 30 of the <em>Canada
    Evidence Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, allows business records to be admitted
    into evidence, upon the satisfaction of the formal criteria, including notice,
    as set out in that section of the Act. Subsection 30(1) of the Act provides as
    follows:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Where oral evidence in respect of a matter would be admissible
    in a legal proceeding, a record made in the usual and ordinary course of
    business that contains information in respect of that matter is admissible in
    evidence under this section in the legal proceeding on production of the record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown gave timely notice under s. 30 of the Act<em> </em>that it intended
    to produce the Big Brothers records. It filed an affidavit, to which the
    records were attached as an exhibit, to satisfy the formal requirements under
    the Act concerning the authenticity of the records, indicating that they were
    “made in the usual and ordinary course of business”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no dispute that the records were authentic business records. 
    Moreover, the factual information about the dates of the relationship between
    the appellant and D.I. as contained in the records would have been admissible
    if given in oral evidence by the author of the records. Most importantly, the
    parties consented to the admission of the records as an exhibit at trial, as “<em>prima
    facie</em> evidence”, according to defence counsel.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown having met the formal prerequisites under s. 30 of the Act,
    the records were therefore admissible as business records as <em>prima facie</em> proof of the truth of their contents: <em>R. v. Smith</em>, 2011 ABCA 136, 510
    A.R. 37, at para. 46.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'>The
    admission of the records into evidence did not preclude other evidence or
    available inference raising a doubt about the reliability of their contents:  </span><em>Smith</em><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'>, at para. 33.</span> <span
style='line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'>The trial judge was
    entitled to accept or reject the evidence provided by the records, just as if
    it had come from a witness during the trial: </span><em>Smith</em><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'>, at para. 35. </span>How
    the trial judge weighed the evidence proffered by the records, in light of the
    whole of the evidence, was a matter of his discretion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of oral argument, it became clear that the appellant did
    not dispute that the Big Brothers records would have been admissible under s.
    30 of the Act as <em>prima facie</em> proof of the truth of their contents if
    they had been filed as part of the Crown’s case in chief. However, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge could not rely on them as evidence of
    the truth of their contents for the reasons that they were not filed by the
    Crown as part of its case in chief and that the appellant did not agree that
    they could be relied upon as such in reply.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree. The trial judge had expressly canvassed the issue of
    the records’ admissibility with counsel, specifically asked them to consider
    whether or not the documents could be considered for the truth of their
    contents, and invited them to come to an agreement if possible, failing which
    he would hear a motion and make a ruling. This proved unnecessary because after
    the close of the defence, the parties advised the court that they had reached
    an agreement that the records could be marked as a numbered exhibit and be
    filed “without objection” as part of the Crown’s case in reply, without the
    necessity of further proof. As the appellant’s counsel reiterated during his
    closing submissions: “I want to address therefore that we all understand that
    by admitting these records in that what we’re establishing by virtue of the
    notice given and the consent given, the records are themselves <em>prima facie</em> evidence” (Trial Transcript, vol. 13, at p. 2).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The admission of the records created no unfairness to the appellant and came
    as no surprise. Indeed, it was the appellant’s counsel who first referred to
    the Big Brothers records during the cross-examination of D.I. and sought to
    rely on portions of the records that assisted the appellant’s position, for the
    truth of their contents. The fact that the records also supported the Crown’s
    case by providing a basis to challenge the credibility of the appellant in
    relation to the length of his Big Brother relationship with D.I. does not
    affect their admissibility. In any event, the trial judge stated that he was
    satisfied of the appellant’s guilt of the offences beyond a reasonable doubt,
    even without reliance on the records.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Big Brothers records were admissible into evidence. Thereafter, the
    weight that the trial judge gave to the records was an exercise of his
    discretion that is subject to deference absent error. In either case, we see no
    basis to interfere.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>Adequacy of the Trial Judge’s reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not explicitly
    setting out why he did not accept the sister’s evidence that she had never come
    home to find the appellant and D.I. in her home, as D.I. had alleged, or why
    that evidence did not leave him with a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s
    guilt, since it corroborated the appellant’s denial that the incident had ever
    taken place. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that a trial judge need not detail his findings
    on each piece of evidence or controverted fact, so long as the findings linking
    the evidence to the verdict can be logically understood: <em>R. v. R.E.M.</em>,
    2008 SCC 51, <span style='line-height:200%'>[2008] 3 S.C.R. 3</span>, at para.
    20. It is also necessary to read a trial judge’s reasons as a whole, in the
    context of the evidence, issues, and submissions at trial, together with an
    appreciation of the purposes or functions for which they are delivered: <em>R.
    v. Villaroman</em>, 2016 SCC 33, 338 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 15; <em>R.E.M.</em>,
    at para. 16.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed the evidence of D.I., the appellant, and the
    appellant’s sister in relation to the allegations that the appellant had taken
    D.I. to his sister’s house and sexually abused him. He heard the submissions of
    Crown counsel as to why he should accept the evidence of D.I. and why the
    evidence of the sister and the appellant concerning the incident in her home
    should be rejected.  Similarly, he considered the submissions of the appellant’s
    counsel as to why he should accept the evidence of the appellant and his
    sister. The trial judge explained why he accepted that D.I. was in the sister’s
    home. In particular, he noted D.I.’s specific details about the unusual layout
    of the house, which the sister confirmed in her testimony. And he stated why he
    did not accept the appellant’s evidence, which necessarily included the
    sister’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it would have been helpful if the trial judge had explicitly set
    out his analysis of all of the evidence, including the sister’s evidence, the
    absence of additional reasons does not preclude meaningful appellate review. Viewed
    in the context of the entire trial, the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate how and
    why he reached his verdict.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s findings were open to him on the record and are
    entitled to deference absent error. He was alert to the necessity of not simply
    choosing between D.I.’s evidence and that proffered by the defence, and considered
    the evidence as a whole. He gave detailed reasons for accepting D.I.’s evidence
    and for finding the appellant’s evidence to be unworthy of belief. There is no
    basis to interfere.</p>
