  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice William A. Gorewich of
    the Ontario Court of Justice, dated July 9, 2015 affirming the decision of
    Justice of the Peace R.S. Shousterman with reasons reported at 2013 ONCJ 643.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Pepall J.A.:</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal involves a constitutional battle over a municipal by-law and
    a body rub parlour.  The City of Vaughan passed By-law 315-2005 regulating the
    operation of body rub parlours in its jurisdiction. The respondent, Eric Tsui,
    owns and operates a body rub parlour that is licensed by the City of Vaughan. He
    was charged with contravening that section of the by-law governing operating
    hours. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tsui challenged the by-law on the basis that it was unconstitutional. He
    argued that the by-law was outside of the municipality’s jurisdiction because
    it constituted criminal law.  Specifically, Tsui submitted that the by-law’s
    provisions governing dress<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> were a prohibition against nudity and the hours of operation provision was a
    prohibition against prostitution.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A justice of the peace accepted Tsui’s arguments and held that, in pith
    and substance, the by-law’s provisions relating to hours of operation and dress
    were criminal in scope and invaded federal authority. As such, she struck the
    provisions as being <em>ultra vires </em>the municipality. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Court of Justice dismissed the City’s appeal. Leave to
    appeal having been granted, the City now appeals to this court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General of Ontario intervened in the appeal to challenge
    the Ontario Court of Justice’s treatment of the scope of the provincial power
    to legislate to suppress conditions conducive to crime.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and order a new
    trial.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background Facts</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>History of the By-law</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About 20 years ago, body rub parlours were not permitted under the City
    of Vaughan’s comprehensive zoning by-law. In 1997, the City considered the
    licensing and regulation of body rub parlours. In April 1997, City Council
    directed staff to prepare a first report on suggested ways to control body rub
    parlours within the municipality and then, in March 1998, requested a second
    report on the potential implementation of a licensing by-law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Council directed that the proposed by-law governing body rub parlours include
    restrictions on hours of operation. Residents had complained about possible
    illegal activity being undertaken at body rub parlours and the negative impact
    on surrounding areas. The hours of operation restriction would reduce the risk
    of illegal activity, which would in turn decrease the nuisance that such
    illegal activities created for surrounding businesses and residents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Council’s minutes of September 28, 1998 described some of this
    background, and addressed a September 23, 1998 report authored by Councillor
    Bernie Di Vona. The report that was reproduced in part in the minutes stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A strong and growing concern has been raised by many residents
    in Woodbridge regarding the presence of “massage parlours”<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> within industrial/commercial areas and most importantly, with the number of
    massage parlours that are opening, three have recently opened in Ward 3 (East
    Woodbridge). With many of these “new” massage parlours, their advertisements
    have included sexually explicit disclosure of the female anatomy leading one to
    conclude that the massage parlour may not carry out the use of a “personal use”
    establishment as desired by the City of Vaughan By-law. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Individuals have expressed that they have found large groups of
    adult males frequent some establishments mostly in the early morning hours. Should
    “ladies of the night” be operating in these establishments, the hours of
    restriction by-law will take the “night away from the ladies of the night” in
    Vaughan for the massage parlours. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Individuals operating close to a “massage parlour”, have
    expressed outrage that they cannot go out during their lunch to shop, walk or
    go to a restaurant, without being propositioned. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Businesses have expressed to me and also to Vaughan Council, at
    a recent Public Hearing that they are concerned with the possible establishment
    of a massage parlour. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The City of Vaughan has asked for a police investigation and it
    has been expressed that the investigation is continuing and that additional
    evidence from new massage parlours has been provided. Since the investigation
    of over 40 massage parlours, and the opening of three new massage parlours in
    Ward 3, the urgency exists that we move quickly and decisively.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is a well known fact that specific types of businesses move
    from a highly regulated area to a low regulated area.</p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 1999 By-law</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 25, 1999, Council passed a stand-alone body rub parlour
    licensing by-law, By-law 30-99, “respecting the licensing, regulating and
    inspecting of body rub parlours and those engaged in the business of providing
    body rubs in body rub parlours” (the “1999 By-law”). The preamble to the 1999 By-law
    stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>WHEREAS section 224 of the <em>Municipal Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990
    c. M.45 (“the Act” as amended) authorizes the Council to pass by-laws for
    licensing, regulating, governing, classifying and inspecting body rub parlours
    and for revoking or suspending any such license and for limiting the number of
    licenses to be granted; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>AND WHEREAS Part XVII.I of the <em>Municipal Act</em> authorizes the Council to pass by-laws for licensing, regulating and governing
    any business carried on within a municipality and includes the authority for Council
    to enact legislation with regard to persons who provide services in connection
    with any such businesses; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>AND WHEREAS the Council deems it advisable, having regard to,
    among other matters, the health, welfare and safety of those within its
    jurisdiction, to enact a by-law to license, regulate, govern and inspect body
    rub parlours, and activities carried on in the business of the operation of
    body rub parlours.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 1999 By-law addressed all manner of matters associated with the
    licensing and regulation of body rub parlours, including the design of
    premises, designated areas, signs and advertisements, and hours of operation. This
    1999 By-law was the predecessor to the substantially similar by-law that is in
    issue on this appeal.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Zoning By-law</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At about the same time it passed the 1999 By-law, the City passed By-law
    31-99. It designated commercial/industrial areas with low visibility to the
    general public as areas where body rub parlours could operate. Adult
    entertainment parlours (strip clubs) and adult video stores were also permitted
    in these areas.</p>
  <h5>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2001 Consolidated By-law</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 15, 2001, the City passed By-law 2-2001, which consolidated
    all City licensing by-laws for all business categories, including body rub
    parlours, into one licensing by-law. This by-law revised the hours of operation
    of establishments that served liquor to provide for a 2:00 a.m. closing, so as to
    ensure compliance with s.148(4) of the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, S.O. 2001, c. 25,</span></em> which prohibits a
    municipality from regulating the hours of operation of a business that sells
    liquor under the authority of a licence issued under the <em>Liquor Licence Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990 c. L.19. Such businesses included adult entertainment parlours,
    which sell liquor, but did not include body rub parlours, which do not. The hours
    of operation applicable to body rub parlours remained the same as those prescribed
    in the 1999 By-law.</p>
  <h5 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 By-law</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2005, the City’s Committee of the Whole (Working Session) (a
    committee comprised of the Mayor and city councillors but not a meeting of Council)
    met to address investigation and enforcement processes and recommendations made
    by the Commissioner of Legal Services in conjunction with the City’s Senior
    Manager of Enforcement Services. One of the topics addressed related to body
    rub parlours. The April 26, 2005 minutes of that meeting included a report,
    which stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although this is a matter that is covered in the Licensing By-law,
    the topic needs to be discussed separately. The City of Vaughan currently has
    23 body rub parlours of which only 5 are licensed. This kind of business has
    been known to employ young girls and immigrant women and usually operates as a
    front to prostitution. The conditions inside these operations are generally
    poor. In the past, special projects have been successful in closing some of
    these establishments down permanently, but as one closes it seems like another
    opens. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>York Regional Police investigate these establishments and those
    in the other municipalities for Criminal Code and by-law violations. City of
    Vaughan Licensing Enforcement has been dedicating two days per month to
    enforcement of this industry.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>York Regional Police have expressed concern that without
    targeted enforcement of this industry, the crime associated with body rub
    parlours will escalate and the potential for homicides such as what happened in
    Markham a year ago will increase. They have also written a letter complaining
    about the lack of enforcement of Body Rub operations by the City of Vaughan. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This is an area which needs dedicated staff to work towards the
    goal of eliminating illegal body rub parlours and demonstrate that commitment
    to York Regional Police.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Attached to the report was a February 21, 2005 letter to the Vaughan
    City Clerk from the York Regional Police expressing concern about enforcement
    of Vaughan’s body rub parlour by-law and illegal body rub establishments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Council received the report for information purposes, but did not act on
    the recommendations as they related to body rub parlours.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 12, 2005, the City replaced By-law 2-2001 with By-law
    315-2005 (the “2005 By-law”), as the former was set to expire on January 30,
    2006 due to the 5-year sunset provision then contained in the <em>Municipal Act,
    2001</em>. The 2005 By-law was essentially a re-enactment of By-law 2-2001. Indeed,
    Council minutes dated November 21, 2005 state: “The proposed comprehensive Licensing
    By-law for the upcoming five years contains few substantive amendments.” However,
    as newly required by the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>, it contained an explanation
    of why the municipality was licensing and imposing conditions on various
    classes of businesses. Under the heading “Reasons for Licensing and Imposing
    Conditions on Classes of Businesses”, those for body rub parlours and attendants
    were described in Council minutes dated November 21, 2005:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Health and Safety: to encourage safe, proper operational and/or
    business practices, including but not limited to compliance with health
    regulations, building code requirements, fire code requirements and liquor
    regulations; to conduct police background checks of principals and attendants,
    attendant age checks and any applicable medical reviews; to ensure proper
    record keeping, including proper records of appointments, bookings and
    arrangements for services; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Consumer Protection: to ensure compliance with all applicable
    regulations, including but not limited to health requirements and regulations,
    age restrictions and ensuring attendants are adequately clothed to protect
    clients from improper exposure, etc.;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nuisance Control: to ensure compliance with zoning
    requirements, noise control and other related requirements.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 2005 By-law is the enactment in issue on this appeal. Section 13 of the
    2005 By-law governs body rub parlours. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charge Under Appeal</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span

    2005 By-law, which governs the operating hours of a body rub parlour. Section
    13.0(1)(h) provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>No Body Rub Parlour Owner or Operator may permit a Body Rub
    Parlour to open or to remain open for business except in compliance with the
    provisions of section&nbsp;13.4 respecting “Hours of Operation”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 13.4(1) provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>No Body Rub Parlour shall be open to the public and no Owner or
    Operator of a Body Rub Parlour may permit services to be provided and no
    Attendant at a Body Rub Parlour may provide services, except on the following

    was $25,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a corporation.  Although the
    Legislature gave municipalities the power to enact a penalty of imprisonment
    for a term not exceeding one year, neither the 1999 By-law nor the 2005 By-law

    fine was $400. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span

    body rub parlours. Section 13.0(1)(o) provides that every attendant at a body
    rub parlour shall be clothed in a manner in which such person’s pubic area and
    buttocks, and in the case of a woman, also her breasts, are completely covered
    by an opaque material. Section 13.0(1)(p) provides that every attendant shall ensure
    that every customer in a body rub parlour is clothed in a manner in which such

    invalid on the basis that the pith and substance of the provisions is criminal
    in scope and therefore <em>ultra vires</em> the municipality’s legislative

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice of the peace did not quash all of s. 13. She did quash ss.&nbsp;13.0(1)(h)

    charged with contravention of the dress provisions, she also quashed ss. 13.0(1)(o)

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City appealed to the Ontario Court of Justice, and the Ontario Court
    appeal judge (“OCAJ”) dismissed the City’s appeal.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasons of the Justice of the Peace</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice of the peace commenced her analysis by acknowledging that
    there was no dispute that the City was entitled to license and regulate body
    rub parlours. She determined that, with the exception of the provisions
    governing dress (ss. 13.0(1)(o) and (p)) and hours of operation (ss. 13.0(1)(h)
    and 13.4), the pith and substance of s. 13 was the regulation of a business,
    which falls within s. 92 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the justice of the peace held that the provisions relating
    to dress and hours of operation were, in pith and substance, criminal. She therefore
    held that those provisions were <em>ultra vires</em> the municipality. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In analyzing the dress provisions, she rejected the City’s submission
    that they addressed health and safety and consumer protection concerns. Rather,
    she concluded that they amounted to an attempt to regulate nudity. As such, they
    amounted to criminal law and were <em>ultra vires</em> the City.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She then turned to the hours of operation provisions. She considered the
    evidence of Joseph Chiarelli, a City manager responsible for the development,
    administration, and enforcement of City by-laws, including the 2005 By-law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chiarelli’s evidence was that the hours of operation provisions were
    created in response to “complaints from residents regarding possible illegal activity
    being undertaken at body rub parlours, and the negative impact that it was
    having on surrounding areas.” The City’s rationale behind the hours of
    operation restriction was that it would “reduce the risk of illegal activity,
    which would in turn decrease the nuisance that such illegal activities created
    for surrounding businesses and residents.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice of the peace inferred that the “illegal activity” referred
    to prostitution, although she subsequently observed that prostitution is legal
    in Canada, and that “nuisance concerns were to be addressed through curtailing
    illegal activity.” She relied on the 2005 report to Council that described the
    concerns of York Regional Police and the need for enforcement of body rub
    parlours.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> She acknowledged, however, that it was unclear whether these concerns related
    to unlicensed establishments only, or to all body rub parlours be they legal or
    illegal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She identified one objective of the impugned by-law as being to combat
    neighbourhood disruption and disorder. This was accomplished by relocating body
    rub parlours to industrial lands in the City and setting up adult entertainment
    districts which would, among other things, encompass body rub parlours. This
    was done, she reasoned, to remove prostitution and other sex related activities
    from residential neighbourhoods. She determined that another objective of the by-law
    was to safeguard the health and safety of the public by requiring individuals
    working in body rub parlours to be healthy and of a minimum age. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice of the peace noted that as far back as 1998, City Council
    had indicated that the purpose of imposing hours of operation in the by-law was
    to take the “night away from the ladies of the night”. This addressed
    prostitution, conduct that was traditionally criminal. She relied on the
    February 21, 2005 letter from the York Regional Police and Chiarelli’s evidence,
    which referenced the September 28, 1998 Council minutes and the 2001 By-law, to
    support her conclusion that the hours of operation provision was an attempt to
    regulate morality. As the zoning by-law had required body rub parlours to
    relocate to industrial areas with other adult entertainment businesses, she
    concluded that the City’s claim of nuisance was muted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She held that the City had entered into criminal law and the hours of
    operation provision was <em>ultra vires</em> the City. The justice of the peace
    also noted that the hours of operation provisions were “unfairly
    discriminatory” because strip clubs are permitted to stay open until 2:00 a.m.,
    whereas body rub parlours must close at 10:00 p.m.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The justice of the peace then considered the double aspect doctrine, but
    determined that it was inapplicable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that the dress and hours of operation provisions were <em>ultra
    vires</em> the City, the justice of the peace invoked s. 52 of the <em>Constitution
    Act, 1867</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em>and quashed ss.
    13.0(1)(h), (o), (p) and 13.4 of the 2005 By-law.</p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ontario Court of Justice dismissed the City’s appeal. The OCAJ agreed
    with the justice of the peace’s analysis and determined that she was correct in
    quashing the dress and hours of operation provisions of the 2005 By-law on the
    basis that, in pith and substance, they amounted to criminal law and were
    therefore <em>ultra vires</em> the City.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCAJ found that the justice of the peace had correctly rejected the
    City’s submission that the by-law was enacted to regulate nuisance and health
    and safety. He held that the justice of the peace did not err in relying on the
    extrinsic evidence in reaching her conclusion that the purpose of the hours of
    operation and dress provisions was to prohibit prostitution. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCAJ rejected the City’s submission that the 2005 By-law was a
    lawful exercise of its delegated provincial authority to suppress conditions
    that may lead to crime. At para. 95, the OCAJ noted: “When the dominant feature
    of legislation is criminal, the authority of provincial power to suppress the
    conditions that may lead to crime is eliminated.” The OCAJ distinguished <em>Chatterjee
    v. Ontario (Attorney General)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2009
    SCC 19, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 624, </span></em>because it involved legislation aimed
    at the general suppression of crime, as opposed to the singling out of a particular
    offence (in this case, prostitution). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCAJ reviewed the history and context of the legislation and
    observed that there was a clear connection between the enactment of the by-law
    and the desire to eliminate prostitution. He noted the references in the
    extrinsic evidence to “ladies of the night” and to body rub parlours operating
    as fronts for prostitution, as well as the letter from the York Regional Police
    enlisting the City’s help in enforcing the body rub parlour licensing regime.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He referenced the maximum fine of $100,000, which he concluded
    reinforced the justice of the peace’s conclusion that the effect of the by-law
    is to stiffen, supplement or replace the criminal law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCAJ also observed that there was only one report addressing
    nuisance concerns. It was from 1999, and, since then, there had been no
    evidence of nuisance concerns. He agreed that nuisance concerns would be
    “muted” because body rub parlours are confined to industrial areas. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, at para. 96, he echoed the justice of the peace’s concerns and
    questioned how it could be said that nuisance caused by body rub parlours,
    which serve no alcohol, is such that they must close by 10:00 p.m., whereas the
    nuisance caused by adult entertainment establishments, which do serve alcohol, is
    either minimal or non-existent such that they are allowed to stay open until 2:00
    a.m.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He stated, at para. 96:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is reasonable to conclude, as did the Justice of the Peace
    in the case at bar, that the enforcement and crackdown of 2006 was not caused
    by nuisance concerns but rather as a result of pressure from the York Regional
    Police who were unequivocal in what they were targeting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Citing the Ontario Court of Justice’s decision in <em>1270627 Ontario
    Ltd. v. Kanata (City)</em> (1998), 49 M.P.L.R. (2d) 170 (Ont. S.C.), the OCAJ held
    that a law will not be upheld if there is a disassociation between the law and
    its reported objective. He likened the facts in this case to those in <em>Westendorp
    v. The Queen</em>, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 43, where the Supreme Court held that a
    by-law prohibiting a person from being on the street for the purposes of
    prostitution was <em>ultra vires</em> the City of Calgary. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, the OCAJ found that the justice of the peace did not err
    in finding that in pith and substance, the impugned by-law provisions amounted
    to criminal law and therefore were <em>ultra vires</em> the City. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scope of the Appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To reiterate, Tsui was charged with contravening s. 13.0(1)(h) of the
    2005 By-law, by permitting a body rub parlour to be open outside of the
    permitted times, which are set out in s. 13.4. He was not charged with
    contravening either of the dress provisions found in ss.&nbsp;13.0(1)(o) and
    (p). Accordingly, we must address the preliminary question of whether this
    court should limit the scope of the appeal to the provisions of the 2005 By-law
    under which Tsui was actually charged. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court limited the scope of an appeal in similar circumstances in <em>R.
    v. Banks</em>, 2007 ONCA 19, 84 O.R. (3d) 1, a case involving charges of
    “squeegeeing” contrary to the <em>Safe Streets Act, 1999</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, S.O. 1999, c. 8,</span></em> and the <em>Highway
    Traffic Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  In the absence of a live controversy,
    this court limited the appeal’s scope to the challenge of the constitutionality
    of the provisions of the provincial statutes under which the appellants were
    actually charged. In doing so, Juriansz J.A. noted, at para. 26, that “making
    unnecessary pronouncements about the constitutionality of legislative
    provisions is an unwarranted exercise of judicial power.” However, the parties
    were able to rely on the entire statute to assist in discerning the purpose and
    effects of the particular provisions in controversy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Here, counsel for Tsui acknowledges that Tsui was only charged under
    the operating hours provision of the 2005 By-law and conceded that there was no
    jurisdiction for the justice of the peace to decide the dress provision. However,
    he also submitted that the dress provisions were relevant to the
    characterization of the by-law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I propose to proceed on a basis similar to that adopted by this court in
    the <em>Banks</em> decision. As such, while only ss. 13.0(1)(h) and 13.4 of the
    2005 By-law dealing with hours of operation are in issue, reference may be had
    to the entire by-law, including the dress provisions, so as to characterize and
    ascertain the purpose and effect of the subsections under which Tsui was
    charged and their constitutionality. </p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issues</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 139 of the <em>Provincial Offences Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. P.33, an appeal lies from the Ontario Court of Justice to this court, with
    leave, on special grounds, upon any question of law alone. On September 18th,
    2015, Sharpe J.A. granted leave to appeal the decision of the OCAJ on three
    questions of law. These questions are at issue on this appeal: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the OCAJ err in his consideration of the “pith and substance” of the
    by-law by focusing exclusively on the extrinsic evidence and failing to engage
    in the exercise of characterizing the purpose and effect of the provision of
    the by-law as it was enacted?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the OCAJ err by failing to give proper scope to the municipal
    objective of legislating to suppress conditions likely to produce crime? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the OCAJ err by holding that, in legislating conditions to suppress
    crime, a municipality cannot target a specific crime but must aim at crime in
    general? </p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Discussion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I will address the standard of review, followed by a discussion
    of the constitutional framework, the municipal context, and the relevant criminal
    law provisions. Lastly, I will address the three questions of law at issue in
    this appeal. </p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standard of Review</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The standard of review on questions of constitutional interpretation is
    correctness. That said, the Supreme Court in <em>Bedford v. Canada (AG)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101,</span></em> established that absent reviewable error in the trial judge’s appreciation of
    the evidence, an appellate court should not interfere with the trial judge’s
    conclusions on social, legislative or adjudicative facts: <em>Bedford</em>, at
    paras. 49 and 56. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constitutional Framework</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fundamental issue raised by this appeal involves a division of
    powers analysis. Was the enactment of the 2005 By-law within the City’s
    jurisdiction? Put differently, are the by-law provisions <em>ultra vires</em> the City, because they relate to a subject matter that is within the exclusive
    jurisdiction of Parliament under the <em>Constitution Act</em>, <i>1867</i>?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em><i> </i>gives Parliament exclusive
    legislative authority over criminal law (with the exception of the constitution
    of courts of criminal jurisdiction) under s. 91(27). The provinces are given exclusive
    legislative authority over (i) “Shop, Saloon, Tavern, Auctioneer, and other Licences
    in order to the raising of a Revenue for Provincial, Local, or Municipal
    Purposes”, under s.&nbsp;92(9), and (ii) property and civil rights in the
    province, under s. 92(13). Thus, the provinces have authority to regulate the
    conduct of most businesses and recreation in the province: see P.W. Hogg, <em>Constitutional
    Law of Canada</em>, loose-leaf (2016-Rel. 1), 5th ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters
    Canada Ltd., 2007), at pp. 18-19. That authority extends to the imposition of
    limits on the hours of operation of commercial establishments: <em>Lieberman v.
    The Queen</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> [1963] S.C.R.
    643. Under s. 92(15) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>, the provinces also
    have the authority to impose punishment by fine, penalty or imprisonment for
    the purpose of enforcing otherwise valid provincial laws.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has provided considerable guidance on how to proceed
    with a division of powers analysis.</p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> Pith and Substance</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first step is to determine the “matter” of the legislation in issue.
    The analysis involves an examination of: (i) the purpose of the enacting body,
    and (ii) the legal effect of the law: <em>Reference re</em> <em>Firearms Act</em>,
    2000 SCC 31, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783, at para. 16. This exercise is traditionally
    known as determining the law’s “pith and substance”: <em>Chatterjee</em><em><span

  <p class=KHeading10>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Purpose</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the enacting body is determined by examining both

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span

    Binnie J. observed, at para. 17: “While a court is not bound by an enactment’s purpose
    clause when considering the constitutional validity of an enactment, a

    reliable and should not be given undue weight. The Supreme Court addressed this
    point in <em>Firearms Reference</em>, at para. 17: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>A law’s purpose is often stated in the

    purpose, it is now well accepted that the legislative history, Parliamentary
    debates, and similar material may be quite properly considered as long as it is
    relevant and reliable and is not assigned undue weight.… Purpose may also be
    ascertained by considering the “mischief” of the legislation – the problem

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>An example of this overlap is found in </span><em>Bédard
    v. Dawson</em><span lang=EN>, [1923] S.C.R. 681. There, the Supreme Court
    upheld the validity of a provincial law that authorized a judge to close a common
    bawdy house for up to one year, notwithstanding the prohibition in the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><i> </i><span lang=EN>against keeping a common bawdy house. The court
    held that the impugned law dealt with property and civil rights by providing
    for the suppression of a nuisance. In concluding that the law was within the
    province’s jurisdiction, Idington J. stated, at p. 684: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[I]</span>t is the duty of the legislature to do
    the utmost it can within its power to anticipate and remove, so far as
    practicable, whatever is likely to tend to produce crime.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Further, Duff J. stated, at p. 684:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The legislation impugned seems to be aimed at suppressing
    conditions calculated to favour the development of crime rather than at the
    punishment of crime. This is an aspect of the subject in respect of which the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where measures enacted pursuant to a provincial power overlap with a
    federal power, the court must identify the “dominant feature” of the measure: <em>Chatterjee</em><em><span

    the subject matter of provincial authority, “the enactment will not be
    invalidated because of an ‘incidental’ intrusion into the criminal law”: <em>Chatterjee</em>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Chatterjee</em><span lang=EN> dealt with a provincial civil
    forfeiture law that was enacted to compensate victims of crime and to deter
    crime. The former purpose was within provincial competence. The latter purpose
    was considered to be broad enough that both the federal and provincial
    governments could pursue it. In that case, </span>the Supreme Court discussed
    the province’s jurisdiction to suppress conditions likely to favour the
    commission of crimes. Binnie J. stated, at para. 40: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The Constitution permits a province to enact
    measures to deter criminality and to deal with its financial consequences so

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overlapping powers are often unavoidable. The “double aspect” doctrine
    acknowledges that some laws simultaneously have both a federal and a provincial
    purpose, roughly equal in importance, and both levels of government may
    legislate with respect to different aspects of the same matter. Provided that
    the federal and provincial laws do not conflict, that is, they are not
    contradictory, and that each law’s purpose is anchored in an appropriate head
    of power, both laws will be deemed valid: <em>Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta</em>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most importantly, a healthy approach to federalism mandates a

    extrinsic evidence. Only then is regard had to the heads of legislative
    competence. A province may legislate in relation to conduct that is encompassed

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of these provisions, the City had the power to enact a by-law

    regulation of the premises, persons engaged in the business, and closing times.
    Indeed, the parties did not dispute that the City is entitled to license and

    to 18-5, Parliament’s power to enact “criminal law” has proved very difficult
    to define. In <em>Proprietary Articles Trade Association v. Canada (AG)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> [1931] AC 310, at p. 324, Lord Atkin
    advanced a definition of criminal law using the question, “Is the act
    prohibited with penal consequences?”  However, subsequent jurisprudence considered
    this definition to be too wide; it had to be supplemented with a third
    ingredient. This ingredient was identified in <em>Canadian Federation of
    Agriculture v. Attorney-General of Quebec et al.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> [1949] S.C.R. 1 (“<em>Margarine
    Reference</em>”), as being a typically criminal public purpose. In that case, Rand
    J. said, at p. 50, that a prohibition was not criminal unless it served “a
    public purpose which can support it as being in relation to criminal law”. Safeguarding
    morality was one such purpose.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, to constitute criminal law, the impugned enactment requires
    a prohibition and a penal consequence.  In addition, the prohibition has to
    serve a criminal public purpose.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the justice of the peace heard Tsui’s application, this court had
    released its decision in <em>Bedford</em>. This court upheld the decision of
    the Superior Court of Justice declaring s. 212(1)(j) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> which prohibited living off the avails
    of prostitution, unconstitutional, and striking “prostitution” from the
    definition of “common bawdy house” for the purposes of s. 210 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court agreed with that determination, except that it also found
    s.&nbsp;213(1)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span style='font-style:

    prostitution,</span></em> to be unconstitutional.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, at the time of the hearing, prostitution itself was not
    illegal, and prostitution was not contained in the definition of a common bawdy
    house. The latter was limited to the practice of acts of indecency. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Criminal Code</em> does address nudity. Section 174 states that
    everyone who, without lawful excuse, is nude in a public place, or is nude and
    exposed to public view while on private property, whether or not the property
    is his or her own, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. </p>
  <h2>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>     Issue 1: The
    Pith and Substance of the By-law </h2>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Positions of the Parties</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the OCAJ made three errors in considering the
    pith and substance of the 2005 By-law provisions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he erred by relying almost exclusively on extrinsic evidence and failing
    to consider the intrinsic evidence. The intrinsic evidence included: the
    general structure of the by-law, which revealed an intent to license and
    regulate businesses; and the by-law’s purpose clause, which reflected a concern
    for the health, safety and welfare of City residents. The intrinsic evidence
    reveals that compliance with the hours of operation and dress provisions were
    conditions of holding a body rub parlour licence and that these provisions
    aimed to suppress conditions likely to produce criminal activity relating to
    the operation of a common bawdy house.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the OCAJ erred by considering irrelevant extrinsic evidence that
    deserved no weight. In particular, he should not have considered the report
    that referred to comments from the York Regional Police, which post-dated the
    original enactment of the substantially similar 1999 By-law. Further, he misapprehended
    the report authored by Councillor Di Vona that is referred to in Council’s
    minutes dated September 28, 1998.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the OCAJ erred by failing to consider the legal effect of the hours
    of operation provisions. The restrictions imposed by the 2005 By-law were licensing
    requirements. They did not apply to the public at large. They were not
    prohibitive, but rather were preventative in nature, and there was also no conflict
    between the <em>Criminal Code</em> and the 2005 By-law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, Tsui submits that neither the justice of the peace nor the
    OCAJ erred in making their findings and conclusions, and deference is owed to
    their decisions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tsui submits that intrinsic evidence was examined. This included the maximum
    fine for violating the by-law, which Tsui argues far exceeds regulatory fines
    for related conduct in other jurisdictions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Tsui submits that in determining that the 2005 By-law had a criminal
    purpose, it was relevant to consider that the prior zoning of body rub parlours
    into industrial areas of the City effectively eliminated any nuisance concerns.
    Further, reliance was properly placed on the inexplicable distinction between
    body rub parlours and other adult entertainment establishments - the latter can
    stay open until 2:00 a.m. and operate with no nudity restrictions. This
    distinction properly informed the OCAJ’s assessment of whether the by-law was
    an attempt to supplement the criminal law. Furthermore, the dearth of evidence
    linking nudity in body rub parlours to the risk of communicable disease
    demonstrated that the restriction was a veiled attempt to supplement criminal
    prohibitions on nudity and common bawdy houses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the findings of fact made by both courts were amply supported
    by the extrinsic evidence of an improper purpose.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As mentioned, the AG intervened in the appeal. Counsel confined his
    submissions to the issue of the scope of provincial – and by extension,
    municipal – authority to legislate to suppress conditions that are conducive to
    crime. In particular, the AG submits that the OCAJ erred to the extent that he
    held that provincial legislatures are limited to legislating to suppress
    conditions that are conducive to crime <span class=Underline>in general</span>,
    and cannot legislate to suppress conditions that are conducive to a specific <em>Criminal
    Code</em> offence.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis of the Pith and Substance</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would give effect to the City’s position on pith and substance. The
    pith and substance of the hours of operation provision is business licensing,
    and the courts below erred in concluding otherwise. In doing so, they failed to
    consider the relevant intrinsic evidence, considered irrelevant extrinsic
    evidence, and failed to consider the legal effect of the provision in issue.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(i)       Failure to Examine

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the City that the OCAJ overlooked the failure of the
    justice of the peace to consider the intrinsic evidence. This included the
    statement of legislative intent found in the by-law’s preamble, the structure
    of the by-law itself, and the absence of provisions containing characteristics
    of criminal law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At para. 88 of his reasons, the OCAJ observed that “the justice of the peace
    was clear, after assessing the real nature of the legislation, in ruling it was <em>ultra vires</em>.” The difficulty with this statement is that the justice of
    the peace did not assess the legislation. Rather, she recited the two sections
    of the by-law dealing with hours of operation and then concentrated her
    analysis on extrinsic evidence relating to the by-law. Significantly in my
    view, nowhere does the justice of the peace discuss the preamble to the by-law,
    which identifies the licensing and regulatory purpose that underlies the
    enactment. To repeat, a statement of legislative intent, while not determinative,
    is a useful tool: <em>Chatterjee</em>, at para. 17. Here, the justice of the peace,
    and then the OCAJ, ignored this interpretative aid. Although form alone is not controlling,
    the intrinsic evidence must be examined: see <em>Morgentale</em>r at para. 51. That
    did not occur here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An examination
    of the by-law’s preamble reveals a stated purpose of licensing, having regard
    to health, safety, consumer protection and nuisance. The conditions of holding
    a body rub parlour licence include hours of operation and dress requirements. As
    with any other business regulated by a municipality, it is not surprising that hours
    of operation are encompassed by such a regulatory scheme.  Regulating hours as
    a condition of licensing serves to address the parameters of the operation of a
    body rub parlour and eliminates late hours that may be conducive to crime
    associated with the operation of a common bawdy house.  The provisions nullified
    by the justice of the peace were rationally connected to the City’s stated
    objective, the elimination of nuisance associated with the operation of a
    common bawdy house.  Neither judge addressed this stated purpose.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, neither
    the OCAJ nor the justice of the peace examined the structure of the by-law. The
    structure reflects a process designed to issue or refuse business licences and
    to monitor compliance with the terms of those licences. The hours of operation
    and dress requirements are conditions associated with holding a body rub
    parlour licence and also suppress conditions likely to produce criminal
    activity.  They are similar to other provisions in the by-law which are
    anchored in the licensing of a business and are designed to curtail the nuisance
    caused by the presence of common bawdy houses by suppressing conditions likely
    to lead to the commission of crime.  (See s.13.3(1) c) – access to the body rub
    parlour shall be kept unlocked; s.13.3(1) d) no part of the body rub parlour
    shall be used as a dwelling or for sleeping purposes or contain therein a bed
    or other furniture which is commonly used or which may be used for sleeping
    purposes; and s.13.3(1) k) – every door to a massage room must have windows of
    a size not less than 36 cm. by 36 cm.) </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An examination
    of the intrinsic evidence also reveals that the by-law contains no prohibition
    against prostitution or against keeping a common bawdy house within the City. 
    The provisions amount to preventative measures.  Moreover, the provisions do
    not apply to the public at large, but just to the regulated business. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tsui submits
    that the by-law’s “extraordinary penalty”, the prior zoning of body rub parlours
    into industrial areas of the City, and the City’s inexplicable distinction
    between body rub parlours and other adult entertainment establishments reflect
    the intrinsic evidence and legal effect relied upon in the lower court
    decisions. Counsel relies on <em>Morgentaler</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>in which the court spoke of fines ranging from
    $10,000 to $50,000 as being a reflection of a criminal law purpose.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing firstly
    with the penalty, I do not accept Tsui’s submission.  First, the City simply
    incorporated the quantum and language of the provincial statute into the
    various iterations of the by-law.  Second, the significance of the dollar
    amount of the fines at issue in <em>Morgentaler</em> must be looked at in the
    context of that decision, which was decided over 20 years ago. Further, s. 429
    of the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em> only now provides for a maximum fine of
    $100,000 for municipal offences.  At the time of the original 1999 By-law and
    the 2005 By-law, the maximum fine was $50,000 for a corporation and $25,000 for
    an individual.  Lastly, the prescribed penalties applied to all activities
    regulated under the 2005 By-law, not just the body rub parlour provisions. The
    prescribed penalties did not reflect a criminal law purpose.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the
    location of body rub parlours in the City, the content of the original 1999 By-law
    and the 2005 By-law on operating hours and dress was identical. The nuisance at
    issue was described as being in “industrial/commercial” areas. The nuisance
    concern continued, despite the body rub parlours being situated in industrial
    areas.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]</span></span></span></a> 
    There was no evidence that suggested that nuisance found in any
    industrial/commercial area differed from that in an industrial area.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the
    distinction between body rub parlours and adult entertainment establishments reflected
    a jurisdictional limitation on the municipality’s legislative authority. As the
    latter category of establishments carried liquor licences, the power to
    regulate their hours of operation rested with the province and not the
    municipality. <em>Pimenova v. Brampton (City) </em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>(2004), 49 M.P.L.R. (3d) 1 (Ont. S.C.)</span></em>, a decision that
    both judges relied on, failed to recognize this limitation. The City was
    entitled to address nuisance concerns relating to the presence of body rub
    parlours by enacting provisions restricting hours of operation even though it
    could not do so with respect to adult entertainment establishments.  To the
    extent it could reduce the community’s nuisance concerns, it was open for the
    City to act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the justice
    of the peace, upheld by the OCAJ, failed to consider the intrinsic evidence and
    based her decision on extrinsic evidence.  They failed to engage in the
    exercise of characterizing the purpose and effect of the by-law.  While a court
    is entitled to examine extrinsic evidence, as discussed in the next section, it
    can be dangerous to simply rely on extrinsic evidence and such evidence must be
    relevant and should not be assigned undue weight: see <em>Keshane</em>, at
    para. 21.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)      Consideration of Extrinsic Evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings me
    to the extrinsic evidence. In my view, the justice of the peace – and
    subsequently, the OCAJ – relied on irrelevant extrinsic evidence. Also, in
    considering whether the by-law was enacted to curb nuisance, the courts below
    misapprehended the evidence, resulting in reviewable error. <i> </i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, there is
    no evidence that Council ever adopted or acted on the 2005 report. Indeed, the
    evidence is to the contrary; it was simply received for information purposes. 
    Secondly, there was no transcript of Council’s discussions, and so, apart from
    the fact that it was received only for information purposes and not adopted,
    the record is incomplete. As stated in <em>Keshane</em>, at para. 24, caution
    must be used in relying on extrinsic evidence where the extrinsic material cannot
    be assessed in the context of a complete record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Pimenova</em>,
    which the justice of the peace relied on, the state of the record was
    considerably different. There, the extrinsic evidence was a council report that
    was tabled immediately prior to the passage of the by-law amendments in issue. In
    any event, <em>Pimenova</em><i> </i>was decided before <em>Chatterjee</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, and the application judge in </span></em><em>Pimenova</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> </span></em>did not consider the intrinsic evidence,
    the legal effect of the law, or the suppression of crime as a legitimate
    municipal objective. Rather, the application judge’s finding of
    unconstitutionality was largely based on the discriminatory distinction in the
    restrictions on the hours of operation relating to adult entertainment dance establishments,
    which, as discussed, a municipality had no legislative authority to regulate. As
    such, the decision is of limited assistance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, the
    language of the 2005 By-law on hours of operation and nudity mirrored that of
    the original 1999 By-law which predated the 2005 report.  The judges ignored
    this temporal reality.  Lastly, and in any event, Council’s motives – or in
    this case, the motives of the York Regional Police – should not be the focus of
    the pith and substance analysis: <em>Canada Post</em>, at para. 40.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree
    with the City that there was a misapprehension of the evidence. The contents of
    the Di Vona Report that were reproduced in Council’s minutes of September 1998
    concerned “the presence of [body rub] parlours within industrial/commercial
    areas” and the complaints generated as a result of these establishments. The
    justice of the peace reasoned, and the OCAJ agreed, that the nuisance concern
    was “muted” because the body rub parlours were being moved to industrial areas.
    This was a palpable and overriding error. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Di Vona Report
    commences with: “A strong and growing concern has been raised by many residents
    in Woodbridge regarding the presence of [body rub] parlours within
    industrial/commercial areas.” While some of the concerns expressed related to
    areas populated with shops and restaurants, they were not confined to those
    areas; industrial areas were included in the description, and the nuisance
    concern originated in those areas.  There was no evidence that suggested that
    the description of industrial/commercial constituted a designation that
    differed from industrial. Furthermore, in his report, Di Vona was not proposing
    a prohibition against prostitution. “Taking the night away” simply removed late
    hours. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the OCAJ
    and the justice of the peace’s emphasis on the extrinsic evidence was
    misplaced. This is particularly so in light of their failure to adequately consider
    the relevant intrinsic evidence, as outlined above. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Legal Effect</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the OCAJ’s
    acceptance of the justice of the peace’s conclusion that the legal effect of
    the by-law was to “stiffen, supplement or replace the criminal law” cannot be
    sustained. The by-law provision under which Tsui was charged reflects no such
    thing. It merely prescribes the hours during which the business may operate – a
    completely legitimate objective. Business licensing falls under a provincial
    head of power. As such, it was legitimate for the by-law as a whole to address
    the suppression of conditions likely to produce crime, a topic to which I turn
    to next.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Summary</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the justice of the peace and the OCAJ ignored significant intrinsic
    evidence and misapprehended the evidence.  They failed to examine and
    characterize the purpose of the by-law and misstated the legal effect of the
    by-law provision in issue. The pith and substance of the hours of operation
    provision, and that of the 2005 By-law as a whole, is business licensing. The
    by-law is designed to regulate a business operating within its municipal
    borders. It was also aimed at the curtailment of nuisance, for which there was
    evidentiary support, and at suppressing conditions that are conducive to crime. </p>
  <h2>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issue 2: Suppression of Conditions Likely to Produce Crime</h2>
  <h5>(a)      Positions of the Parties</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    submits that suppression of crime is a valid municipal objective. It must be
    tied to a provincial head of power – in this case, a municipality’s delegated
    authority to regulate conduct within licensed premises pursuant to ss. 92(9)
    and 92(13).  It argues that the OCAJ lost sight of the fact that the impugned
    provisions were also part of a business licensing regime, and therefore a
    municipality may regulate conduct within licensed premises pursuant to ss.
    92(9) and 92(13) even when that conduct is related to criminal law and
    morality: see <em>Rio Hotel Ltd</em>.  The OCJA failed to give proper scope to
    the municipal objective of legislating to suppress conditions likely to produce
    crime.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, to the
    extent there was any jurisdictional overlap, the provincial aspects of the 2005
    By-law overwhelmingly outweigh the federal aspects. The dominant purpose of the
    By-law therefore relates to ss. 92(9) and 92(13) of the <em>Constitution Act,
    1867</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> and the provisions
    are <em>intra vires</em> the City.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tsui responds by
    submitting that unlike provincial legislatures, pursuant to the <em>Municipal
    Act, 2001</em>, a municipality may only exercise its licensing powers for one
    of three purposes: health and safety, nuisance, and consumer protection. For the
    2005 By-law to have been validly enacted, both the restrictions imposed and the
    conditions of crime targeted must relate to one of these three purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The AG submits
    that as long as the pith and substance of the law relates to a provincial head
    of power, a province may validly legislate to suppress conditions of crime in
    relation to conduct that is also captured by an offence under the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. Legislating to suppress conditions that are likely to favour the
    commission of crimes has repeatedly been held to be within provincial competence
    under s. 92(13) and s. 92(16) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>.</p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(b)     Analysis of the City’s
    Authority to Enact a By-law that Serves to Suppress Conditions Likely to Produce
    Crime</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To reiterate, a
    province may enact measures to deter criminality providing they are taken in
    relation to a head of provincial competence: <em>Chatterjee</em>. The 2005
    By-law is anchored in the province’s authority over property and civil rights (s.
    92(13)) and licences (s. 92(9)). Together, these sections create a “power of
    regulation through licences”: <em>Smith v. St. Albert (City)</em>, 2014 ABCA
    76, 93 Alta. L.R. (5th) 295, at para. 47. The province has delegated that
    authority to the municipality through the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>. Accordingly,
    as the subject-matter of the 2005 By-law relates to a provincial head of power,
    namely business licensing, it was open to the municipality to enact a by-law that
    serves to suppress conditions conducive to crime.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An examination
    of the 2005 By-law as a whole reveals a licensing scheme of which the hours of
    operation and dress provisions are a part.  The by-law establishes conditions
    designed to regulate businesses operating in the municipality.  It defies
    reason that prescribed hours of operation would not be a legitimate condition
    for the licensing of a business.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the dress
    provision, in <em>Rio Hotel Ltd.</em>, the prohibition against nudity was a
    licensed condition in a by-law.  The Supreme Court cited with approval the
    decision of <em>Re Sharlmark Hotel and Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto</em> (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 129.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[11]</span></span></span></a> 
    Although the <em>Criminal Code</em> included nudity provisions, the impugned
    by-law was upheld.  Estey J. wrote, at pp. 73-4: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>The by-law may have been designed
    to create conditions to prevent crime or even as legislation relating to
    morality, but it nonetheless did not encroach on the forbidden field of
    criminal law.  It is but another illustration of the subtle but discernible distinction
    between criminal legislation and regulation established to support and promote
    the operation of a valid provincial legislative object.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>In each of the above-cited cases
    the provincial regulation in question was directed at the orderly operation of
    the licensed premise in question, be it a tavern, adult entertainment parlour,
    or a massage parlour.  Conduct which would detract from the efficiency and
    orderliness of these operations was either the grounds for the cancellation of
    the licence or for process in the criminal courts of the provincial offence
    established in support of the provincial regulation</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>The same holds true in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to
    Tsui’s submissions, the suppression of conditions conducive to crime was
    reflected in the preamble and structure of the by-law, and in the relevant extrinsic
    evidence. There was also evidence to support the City’s perception of nuisance.
    There is no requirement that a municipal council have “hard evidence” before
    passing a by-law; the evidence may be impressionistic rather than factual, and
    courts owe deference to <span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;color:#191919'>municipalities</span><span

    see <em>Adult Entertainment Assn. of Canada v. Ottawa (City)</em>, 2007 ONCA
    389, 224 O.A.C. 267, at para. 30. Each level of government has a responsibility
    for its citizens. Here, the City was acting to protect its citizens from
    nuisance in the community. The presumption of constitutionality seeks to thwart
    the undermining of that objective.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, the
    dominant purpose of the provisions in issue do not amount to criminal law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as
    mentioned, the licensing conditions only apply to the licence holder for a body
    rub parlour, not to the public at large. It is not an enactment of general
    application. As in <em>Smith</em>, the conditions are part of a “larger,
    comprehensive regulatory scheme that establishes conditions for obtaining and
    maintaining business licences”: at para. 50. Second, the purpose is to reduce
    nuisance by regulating body rub parlours so as to suppress conditions conducive
    to crime. The beneficiaries of the 2005 By-law are the citizens of Vaughan, not
    the victims of any crime. Third, as reflected in the general provisions of the
    licencing by-law, the penalty for operating outside of the prescribed hours is
    a fine and/or the suspension or revocation of the licence; there is no
    prohibition of any criminal act. There is also no duplication with the criminal
    law. The provisions are preventative, not prohibitive.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCAJ erred
    by failing to give proper scope to the municipal objective of business
    licensing and legislating to suppress conditions likely to produce crime. The
    dominant purpose of the by-law provisions related to s. 92(9) and 92(13) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> and were the proper subject matter of
    provincial authority. Further, there was evidence of nuisance to support the
    municipality’s exercise of authority under the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    submits that the OCAJ erred in agreeing with the justice of the peace that in
    legislating conditions to suppress crime, a municipality cannot target a
    specific crime, but instead must target crime in general. This is contrary to
    the jurisprudence: see <em>Smith</em>, <em>Keshane</em>, <em>Prince Edward
    Island (Provincial Secretary) v. Egan</em>, [1941] S.C.R. 396, <em>Ross v. Ontario
    (Registrar of Motor Vehicles)</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 5, and <em>Goodwin</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The AG supports
    the appellant’s position on this issue and notes that <em>Chatterjee</em> did
    not stand for the proposition that provincial laws that suppress conditions
    conducive to particular crimes are <em>ultra vires</em>.  <em>Goodwin</em>,
    which was decided after the judgment under appeal and is discussed below, is a
    complete answer to this issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral
    argument, Tsui conceded that municipalities may target a specific crime. He
    submits, however, that if a province or municipality singles out a crime, there
    is a stronger inference that the enacting body is trying to suppress crime
    because of its criminal nature, and not because of a secondary community
    impact. Tsui emphasizes that legislation to suppress the conditions conducive
    to crime must be anchored in a valid provincial head of power. There is no
    free-standing power to suppress crime.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    OCAJ erred in determining that a municipality, in the exercise of provincial
    delegated authority, is limited to legislating to suppress conditions that are
    conducive to crime in general. The jurisprudence does not reflect such a
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The OCAJ held
    that in <em>Chatterjee</em>, the legislation was aimed at the general
    suppression of crime – no aim was taken at any particular category of criminal
    conduct. As such, he reasoned that the justice of the peace correctly concluded
    that the City was improperly targeting a specific crime, namely prostitution.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key, as
    discussed, is that the exercise of provincial authority must engage, in pith
    and substance, a matter within provincial legislative competence. The
    legislation may then also suppress conditions conducive to crime. It matters
    not whether this extends to crime in general, or to a particular crime. The
    Supreme Court has not suggested such a limitation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Chatterjee</em> must be read in context. It was addressing legislation aimed at a variety of
    unlawful activities – hence the reference to crime in general. In addition, the
    court referred with approval to <em>Egan </em>and<em> Ross</em>, two decisions involving
    provincial legislation aimed at “deterring impaired driving, notwithstanding
    its status as a federal offence”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More recently,
    in <em>Goodwin</em>, the Supreme Court stated, at paras. 29 and 32:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>At the end of the day, the purposes and effects of a law must
    be considered together, rather than in isolation, to determine its pith and
    substance. <u>No doubt the ARP [automatic roadside prohibition] scheme has
    incidental impacts on criminal law.</u> <u>No doubt it targets, in part,
    specific criminal activity</u> and imposes serious consequences, without the
    protections attendant on criminal investigations and prosecutions. However, the
    consequences relate to the regulation of driving privileges. In my view, the
    chambers judge was correct in characterizing the pith and substance of the ARP
    scheme as “the licensing of drivers, the enhancement of highway traffic safety,
    and the deterrence of persons from driving on highways when their ability is
    impaired by alcohol”. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Provincial drunk-driving programs and the criminal law will
    often be interrelated. Some provincial schemes have relied incidentally on
    criminal convictions. A number of provincial courts of appeal have also upheld
    schemes that are not dependent on criminal convictions but rely incidentally on <em>Criminal Code</em> provisions. <u>This jurisprudence makes clear that a
    provincial statute will not invade the federal power over criminal law merely
    because its purpose is to target conduct that is also captured by the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>.</u> [Emphasis added.] [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is evident
    from <em>Goodwin</em> that Tsui’s submissions on this final issue must fail.
    Where the pith and substance of the legislation comes under a head of
    provincial authority, it may also aim to suppress conditions conducive to
    crime, even if those conditions relate to a specific <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>offence.
    The OCAJ improperly narrowed the scope of provincial authority to legislate to
    suppress conditions conducive to crime.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion,
    for these reasons, the decisions of the OCAJ and the justice of the peace must
    be overturned. I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. None of the
    parties requested costs and none are ordered.</p>
