    and the sentence imposed on July 9, 2015 by Justice Edward M. Morgan of the
    Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Judge align=center style='text-align:center'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>ENDORSEMENT</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of multiple sexual offences against his son,
    who six years old at the time of the offences. The appellant was sentenced to
    five years imprisonment with ancillary prohibition orders. He appeals against
    conviction and seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal aspects
    of the sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out below, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.
    With respect to the sentence appeal, the extension of time, the leave to appeal
    sentence, and the appeal of sentence are granted, but limited to the extent of
    the Crown’s concession, as explained below.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conviction appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant raised several issues on appeal, only two alleged
    errors were strenuously pursued in oral argument: (1) the trial judge’s failure
    to find that the complainant’s evidence was tainted by collusion; and (2) the
    trial judge’s admission, as similar fact evidence, of the appellant’s criminal
    record for the sexual assault of an 8 year old girl. </p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Collusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The argument from collusion was characterized by counsel for the
    appellant as the heart of the appeal. The factual background is this: the
    appellant had an unstable relationship with the complainant’s mother for the
    first three years of the complainant’s life. The appellant and the
    complainant’s mother had an acrimonious separation, and the complainant visited
    his father every second weekend. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues, effectively, that the complainant’s mother
    influenced the complainant’s evidence by speaking negatively about him and, specifically,
    by continually questioning the complainant, and having public authorities question
    the complainant, about whether the appellant had ever sexually abused him. The
    backstory to this questioning is that when the complainant was 11 years old,
    the appellant pleaded guilty to the sexual assault of an eight-year-old girl, K.I.,
    the daughter of the appellant’s girlfriend at the time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later, when the complainant was 15 years old and the appellant had been
    out of his life and his mother’s life for several years, he spontaneously disclosed
    the sexual abuse in notes and drawings that he gave to his foster father. In
    those writings he also mentioned the appellant’s abuse of K.I.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the complainant’s description of events was influenced
    by his mother in several different ways: First, through exposure to his
    mother’s ill-will towards the appellant fueled by years of acrimonious family
    litigation; second, through repeated questioning of the complainant; third, by his
    mother informing him about the appellant’s abuse of K.I.  Additionally, the
    appellant argues that the complainant may have had opportunity to speak with
    K.I. directly, and may have colluded with her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found, however, that mere opportunity is insufficient
    and that there was no evidence that the complainant spoke with K.I. about the
    incidents involving her. The trial judge further found that the other instances
    of possible collusion raised by the appellant were in the realm of conjecture.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further argues, however, that the absence of evidence of
    collusion is the fault of the Crown in not calling the complainant’s mother as
    a witness at the <em>voir dire</em>. The appellant argues that the evidence at
    the <em>voir dire</em> met the necessary evidential threshold requiring the
    Crown to call the mother to give evidence. The Crown did not do so, with the
    result, the appellant argues, that the defence was deprived of her evidence,
    particularly of what she told the complainant about the incidents involving
    K.I.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree that the trial judge made any error in finding that there
    was no evidence of collusion between the complainant and his mother that would satisfy
    the threshold requirement. The mere fact of questioning of the complainant was
    not sufficient, and there was no evidence that anyone discussed the details of
    the offences against K.I. with the complainant.  Significantly, the
    complainant’s evidence about what he witnessed of the appellant and K.I., in
    fact, was different than what the complainant would have known if he had relied
    on accounts of the appellant’s prior conviction. This ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Similar fact evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the second ground of appeal, the trial judge made no error in
    admitting the similar fact evidence. He adverted to the correct legal
    principles and found relevant similarities between the prior offences (to which
    the appellant had plead guilty) and the offences against the complainant. Both
    sets of offences were characterized as opportunistic, secretive encounters. In
    both cases, the appellant exploited the vulnerability of pre-pubescent children
    under his care. The children were similar in age and in both cases there was a
    similar pattern of escalation. In both cases, the exploitation occurred
    suddenly, without grooming, recurred over a few weeks, and then suddenly
    stopped.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentence appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal
    various provisions of an ancillary prohibition order. The Crown concedes that one
    part of the prohibition order – the prohibition on communicating with persons
    under the age of 16 (paragraph (d) of the prohibition order) – is
    unconstitutional for retroactive application, following the recent decision of
    the Supreme Court in <em>R. v. K.R.J.</em>, 2016 SCC 31.  The Crown also
    concedes that the lifetime prohibition on being within 2 km of the complainant
    (paragraph (b) of the prohibition order) should be varied to a 15 year ban. To
    the extent of these two concessions, we grant the extension to appeal sentence,
    grant leave to appeal, and order the sentence be varied by deleting paragraph
    (d) of the prohibition order, and replacing the lifetime prohibition in
    paragraph (b) with a 15 year prohibition. We cannot address the remainder of
    the prohibition order in the absence of a constitutional challenge, and make no
    comment on its constitutionality. We do not grant the extension of time to
    apply for leave to appeal those aspects of the sentence.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal against conviction is dismissed. We grant an extension of
    time to appeal sentence as set out above, grant leave to appeal, and order the
    sentence varied by deleting paragraph (d) of the prohibition order, and by
    replacing the lifetime prohibition in paragraph (b) with a 15 year prohibition.</p>
