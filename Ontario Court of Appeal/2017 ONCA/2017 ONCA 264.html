    appellants, Alexander Bimman and 2182474 Ontario Inc. (“218”), were minority
    investors in the respondent, Corayana Enterprises Limited (“CEL”), which owned
    several multi-unit residential complexes in Thompson, Manitoba. CEL acquired
    the properties and renovated them, for subsequent sale or lease.</span></p>

    company, 218, initially held 20% of CEL’s issued shares. In early 2010, CEL
    required further funds to renovate its properties. Unable to secure third party
    financing, CEL’s shareholders made two cash calls – on January 11 and February
    11, 2010. Bimman declined to participate in either cash call; all other
    shareholders participated.</span></p>

    on a provision in their November 3, 2009 Shareholders’ Agreement (the “SHA”), the
    majority of CEL’s shareholders approved the issuance of additional shares to shareholders
    who had participated in the cash calls, thereby diluting Bimman’s ownership
    interest in CEL. </span></p>

    B.16. By the time of the trial, the parties had agreed that a parting of the
    ways was required. The main issues for trial therefore became: (i) had the respondents
    engaged in oppressive conduct; and (ii) if they had, how many CEL shares did
    the appellants own and what was their value as of December 31, 2013, the
    agreed-upon valuation date for a buy-out?</span></p>

    trial judge found, in effect, that the respondents had engaged in conduct that was
    unfairly prejudicial to the appellant’s interests by issuing too many shares on
    the January and February 2010 cash calls. That finding is not in issue on this
    appeal.</span></p>

    his Judgment, the trial judge granted declarations (i) specifying the number of
    shares CEL ought to have issued on the two cash calls and (ii) the resulting
    ownership interest of the appellants in CEL, which he fixed at 11.08%. The
    trial judge then valued the appellants’ shares in CEL as of December 31, 2013
    at $858,468.31, and he ordered the respondents to purchase those shares for
    that amount, plus pre-judgment interest.</span></p>

    verbatim at paragraphs 66 and 137 of the Reasons. </p>

  <p class=CQuote>However, I make the following observations in this Addendum to
    my Reasons for Judgment:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>a. A reading of my Reasons indicates that while I did not
    deal with the argument sought to be revisited in this motion head on, which I
    am not in any event obliged to do in the discharge of my duties as a jurist, I
    implicitly rejected the interpretation asserted again in this motion. I was
    very much alive to the issue when it was argued and as I wrote the judgment.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>b. The argument now advanced by the plaintiffs was not rooted
    in any facts to which my attention was directed during the evidence portion of
    the trial, nor during argument. In effect, it was a gloss put on the words of
    the November Shareholders’ Agreement by plaintiffs’ counsel. It was, as I
    observed during argument, a “4 a.m. inspiration,” which all good counsel have
    in the heat of battle. It was not plaintiffs’ counsel’s primary or strongest
    argument.</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>c. Put otherwise, the argument advanced by plaintiffs’
    counsel was not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time
    the Shareholders’ Agreements were being negotiated. Indeed, while the words
    “necessary funds” were used in an earlier draft of the August Agreement, when
    Article 6.01(b) was debated by Itkine and Bimman in various email exchanges, its
    use in the earlier iteration of the agreement actually undercuts the
    plaintiffs’ suggested interpretation in my view. </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>d. Finally, this proposed interpretation is not referenced
    in the pleadings, which although not those of trial counsel, still must be considered
    in defining the issues for trial and judgment. In that respect, a review of
    paragraph 6 of the Plaintiffs’ Reply and Defence to Counterclaim is most
    instructive. </p>

  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Ellyn did not lump all the events of the month of March as

  <p class=CQuote>While this argument had some appeal, in my view it would only
    succeed if I found that the cash calls were either not necessary or a ruse at
    the relevant time, and that none of the money had been contributed along the
    way. I am satisfied the evidence belies those conclusions. Therefore, I hold
    that Bimman’s interest in CEL as at March 31, 2010, should be reduced to
    11.08%. I now must embark upon a calculation of its value as at December 31,

    s. 6.01(b) of the SHA, which provides that the number of new shares would be
    based on both (i) the contributions of the participating shareholders and (ii)
    the “then current values of the [CEL] shares before and after the

    one comparable was used in the Direct Comparison Approach (68 Fox Bay) and that
    comparable was discounted by 15% due to size difference between 68 Fox Bay and
    the Buildings 1 and 2. The same comparable (68 Fox Bay) was used in Red River’s
    2013 appraisal in the Direct Comparison Approach, however, the selling price
    was not discounted as it had been in Red River’s 2009 Appraisal. Had Red River

  <p class=CQuote>Conversely, I am not persuaded that Bimman’s activities prior
    to October 2009 warrant compensation to the levels he proposes. From my
    understanding of the project, namely a conversion of very modest apartments to
    prime rental property in Thompson, the day-to-day activities associated with
    the renovations were really left to Neiman and the team he assembled to
    complete. I am satisfied that much of the heavy lifting in respect of the
    renovation work and the subsequent marketing and rental of the units, if not as
    entire buildings, was done after Bimman was forced out of the day-to-day
    management of the Property.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Furthermore, while Bimman may have introduced UCN [University College
    of the North] to the Property, and may have been instrumental in retaining
    appraisers to assist in the marketing of the two buildings, the deal that was
    struck was concluded under Neiman’s watch, with little or no Bimman
    involvement.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I have not lost sight of the fact that Bimman was forced out of
    the management group as a result of exaggerated, if not unfounded, allegations
    of impropriety bordering on embezzlement. I have concluded that while Bimman’s
    resignation was perhaps ill-advised, the defendants, with Itkine at the helm,
    made his life positively miserable during this period of time. He had no
    alternative but to resign, if only to secure his entitlement to a healthy
    portion of the DMF, a negotiation which never took place, notwithstanding earlier
    promises from Itkine to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Bimman did not, however, have a reasonable expectation to one
    half of the amount reserved for the DMF, or $250,000, after his resignation and
    based on the status of the development to that date. Indeed, it does not appear
    that he ever asserted such a claim, as it is not evidenced in any of the
    meeting minutes either prior to or following the date of his resignation and
    into early 2010. His final entitlement to a portion of the DMF was very much a
    matter left for future negotiation.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>That said, I am satisfied that but for the timing of his forced
    resignation from CEL, he would have been permitted to stay and participate in
    the management of the project and undoubtedly would have been entitled to an
    increased share of the DMF, a share greater than that to which the defendants
    suggest he’s entitled. In that respect, I find that he is entitled to share in
    the DMF up to the end of March 2010, the moment in time that I have held that
    the oppression took place. This adds an additional five months to the
    calculation. Using the straight mathematical formula that both parties are
    agreed to, this calculation yields a DMF entitlement of $112,068.</p>

    reducing the amounts of experts’ fees recoverable as disbursements, and (iv)

    Real Estate Services Inc., had contracted with a local paint store owner, Lucy
    Lambert, to involve some of the CEL work crew in painting projects in Thompson
    (the “Lambert Contracts”). In October 2009, Bimman was accused of having

    costs on a higher scale:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Lead counsel for the Defendants, from the drop of the puck at
    trial, downplayed the importance of the Lambert Contracts and their impact on
    the decision-making process surrounding the raising of funds necessary to
    finance CEL in the formative days, a process counsel allowed was critical to
    the ultimate success of CEL. This approach, whether undertaken by plan or
    happenstance, meant that <span class=Underline>the allegations of fraud formed

    the appellants submit the trial judge acted inconsistently in awarding punitive
    damages against Neiman and Itkine, but not awarding substantial indemnity costs
    against the respondents. I do not agree. An award of punitive damages does not
    automatically translate into an award of substantial indemnity costs. An award
    of costs acts to provide fair and reasonable indemnity for legal expenses
    incurred when assessed in light of all of the factors enumerated in rule
    57.01(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:

    nature of the allegations asserted in a proceeding, but also how a party
    conducts a proceeding. The trial judge’s cost endorsement disclosed he took all
    relevant factors into account. At para. 39, the trial judge explained how he
    balanced them:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>On balance, I am satisfied, having regard to the matters
    described above, that a payment of costs to the Plaintiffs on a partial
    indemnity basis only is appropriate in all the circumstances. I decline to
    award costs of any aspect of this case on a substantial indemnity basis since I
    am not persuaded that there was clear evidence throughout of “reprehensible,
    scandalous or outrageous conduct” to warrant an award of elevated costs, even
    though, I dare say, that the allegations of Bimman’s alleged misdeeds loomed
    large throughout the stages of the proceedings ramping up to trial. In any
    event, I am of the view that the award of punitive damages sounded a note of
    condemnation to the “lead” Defendants for their sometimes inappropriate
    behaviour.</p>
