  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Cory A. Gilmore of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated January 15, 2016, with reasons reported at
    2016 ONSC 371 and 2016 ONSC 370.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Epstein J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This appeal involves the
    interpretation of provisions in two statutes – the <em>Condominium Act, 1998</em>,
    S.O. 1998, c. 19 (the “Act”), and the <em>Real Property Limitations Act,</em> R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (the “</span><em>RPLA</em><span style='line-height:200%'>”).
    This interpretive exercise arises out of two separate applications that were
    heard together. The applications concern the obligation of the appellant, Talon
    International Inc., to return deposits that the respondents – Young Sook Yim
    and Paul Chung-Kyu Kim (collectively “Ms. Yim”),<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> in one application and Adrian B. Harvey and Harvey Legacy Holdings Ltd. (collectively,
    “Mr. Harvey”), in the other – paid toward the purchase of condominium units in
    Talon’s development known as Trump Tower.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Several years after entering into
    their respective agreements of purchase and sale (an “APS”) with Talon, Ms. Yim
    and Mr. Harvey each provided written notices to Talon, advising of their
    intention to “terminate” the transaction. Both stated their basis for doing so
    as being, in part, what they viewed as material changes to the revised
    disclosure statement Talon had provided to them. Both requested the return of
    their deposits. The respondents take the position that their communications constituted
    valid notices to rescind their respective APS under s. 74(6) and (7) of the Act.
    Because Talon had not challenged, within the time the Act allows, either Ms.
    Yim’s or Mr. Harvey’s right to rescind, the respondents applied to the court
    for an order that Talon return their deposits. Talon defended on the basis that
    the respondents’ purported notices to rescind did not meet the requirements of
    the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge allowed both
    applications. She held that the notices sufficiently complied with the
    requirements of s. 74(7) of the Act. Each notice therefore triggered Talon’s
    obligation to challenge the alleged material change set out within ten days of
    receipt, or to accept the claim for rescission. Because Talon did not challenge
    the respondents’ claims for rescission, the application judge ordered Talon to
    refund Ms. Yim’s and Mr. Harvey’s deposits, with interest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In Ms. Yim’s case, Talon also
    argued that she was seeking to amend her notice of application to claim
    statutory rescission more than two years after the date on which such a claim
    was discovered. Her amendment was therefore statute-barred, pursuant to s. 4 of
    the </span><em>Limitation Act</em><i><span style='line-height:200%'>, 2002</span></i><span
style='line-height:200%'>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Schedule B. The application judge disagreed.
    She held that the ten-year limitation period in s. 4 of the </span><em>RPLA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> governed claims for the refund of deposits advanced
    toward the purchase of condominium units. Ms. Yim’s claim was, therefore, not out
    of time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In this appeal, Talon submits that
    the application judge erred in over-emphasizing the fact that the Act is
    consumer-protection legislation, and consequently provided an overbroad interpretation
    of s. 74(7) of the Act. And, in the case of Ms. Yim, Talon argues that the
    application judge erred in holding that her claim for the return of her deposit
    fell within the provisions of the </span><em>RPLA</em><span style='line-height:
200%'>. It further submits that Ms. Yim’s application as a whole is
    statute-barred, as it was brought more than two years after discovery of the
    claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would dismiss both appeals. </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I agree with the application judge that it would be
    contrary to the purpose of the Act, as consumer protection legislation, to
    adopt a technical approach in interpreting what a purchaser must do to notify
    the declarant of an intention to rescind under s. 74(7). The section requires
    that “notice of rescission” be in writing, and that it be delivered to the
    declarant or his or her solicitor. By implication, the notice also must make it
    clear that the purchaser seeks to set aside the APS based on an identified
    material change. In my view, there is no reason to interfere with the
    application judge’s conclusion that the notices delivered by Ms. Yim and Mr.
    Harvey satisfied these requirements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I also agree with the application
    judge that Ms. Yim’s claim to recover her deposit fits within the definition of
    an action for the recovery of land under the <em>RPLA</em>. The applicable
    limitation period is therefore ten years, and Ms. Yim’s application is not statute-barred.</span></p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>STATUTORY
    PROVISIONS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The main issue in these appeals
    involves the interpretation of the provisions in the Act that give a purchaser
    the right to rescind his or her APS. These provisions are found in s. 74 of the
    Act, which provides that within ten days of receipt of a revised disclosure
    statement containing a material change or notice of change that is material, a
    purchaser has the right to rescind the APS. If the declarant takes the position
    that no material change has occurred, the declarant may bring an application to
    the Superior Court under s. 74(8) for a declaration on the question of
    materiality. Sections 74(9) and (10) require that the declarant refund the
    purchaser’s money with interest within ten days of receipt of the notice of rescission
    if no application has been made to the court on the issue of materiality, or if
    an application is made, within ten days of a determination that the change is
    material. The requirements of the notice of rescission are set out in s. 74(7),
    which provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote> (7) To rescind an agreement of purchase and sale under this
    section, a purchaser or the purchaser’s solicitor shall give a written notice
    of rescission to the declarant or to the declarant’s solicitor. 1998, c. 19, s.
    74 (7).</p>

  <h2>Ms. Yim v. Talon</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On May 4, 2007, Ms. Yim signed an
    APS to purchase from Talon suite 1702 at Trump Tower for $860,000. Pursuant to
    the terms of the APS, Ms. Yim provided deposits totalling $172,000 to Talon. She
    received the required disclosure from Talon. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On February 18, 2012, a
    representative for Talon sent a letter to Ms. Yim and to her solicitor advising
    that the Hotel Unit Maintenance Agreement (HUMA) was now available online.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On February 23, 2012, after
    reviewing the HUMA, Ms. Yim had her solicitor send a letter to Talon’s solicitor.
    This letter provided as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Further to the letter dated February 9, 2012 received from your
    client, Talon International Inc., regarding the extension of the proposed
    occupancy date from February 14, 2012, for above-noted suite, <b>my clients
    hereby give notice to terminate the [APS] dated May 4, 2007 </b>and all
    amendments made thereto, effective immediately, <b>and to request the return of
    the deposits forthwith</b> to our firm made payable to Lee &amp; Ma LLP in
    trust. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The basis of this notice is premised on paragraph 13 of the
    underlying [APS], which provides that the Vendor's right to extend the closing
    date shall not &quot;exceed twenty-four (24) months&quot; in the aggregate.
    Given that the original occupancy closing date was scheduled to be March 20,
    2009 (paragraph 2(a) in the [APS]), the Vendor's right to extend the closing
    date has expired on March 20, 2011, and is therefore no longer applicable. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>In the alternative, the [HUMA], the full copy of which was
    provided at the last-minute, contains terms that are materially different from
    that indicated in the Disclosure, not to mention the substantive differences in
    the projected expenses. </b></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Given that the condominium prices have surged in the past 4-5
    years, I trust that your client is not in any way prejudiced by this notice. <b>Your
    prompt response and return of deposits is respectfully requested and expected</b>.
    Thank you. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    her counsel send a follow-up email to Talon’s representative, indicating that
    she was exercising her right to rescind the APS. This email specifically referenced
    s. 74 of the Act, as well as the change in the HUMA.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Talon took no steps in response to
    these communications. Ms. Yim issued her notice of application in this
    proceeding on December 10, 2014. By the time the application was heard, on
    December 14, 2015, Ms. Yim no longer relied upon the expiration of the vendor’s
    right to extend the closing date, as mentioned in her February 23, 2012 letter.
    She now relied solely on the alternative position advanced in the letter, with
    respect to the HUMA’s containing materially different terms from the
    disclosure.</span></p>

    instructed not to proceed with the interim closing. The solicitor noted that he
    was no longer acting for Mr. Harvey in any capacity. That evening, Mr. Harvey
    sent a letter to Talon’s representative via email. The letter stated as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Further to the letter dated February 9, 2012 received from your

  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>THE
    APPLICATION JUDGE'S REASONS</span></h1>
  <h2>Ms. Yim v. Talon</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As a preliminary matter, Ms. Yim
    moved to amend her notice of application to add a request that the court
    declare that the APS had been rescinded. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ms. Yim’s notice of application,
    issued on December 10, 2014, made no mention of a claim based on rescission
    under the Act. Instead, she sought a declaration that Talon was in breach of
    the APS, a declaration that the APS was terminated and of no force and effect,
    and an order that Talon return the deposit. In the alternative, she sought an
    order granting relief from forfeiture of the deposit, and return of the
    deposit. Before the application judge, Ms. Yim brought a motion to amend her
    notice of application to add a claim for statutory rescission. Among the
    arguments raised by Talon in opposing the amendment was that the claim for
    rescission was statute-barred.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    amendment. She held that Ms. Yim’s claim for rescission fell within s. 4 of the<i> <em>RPLA</em></i><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span> </em>which
    provides for a limitation period of ten years. The claim for the return of a
    deposit pursuant to the Act fell within the </span><em>RPLA</em><i><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>as “an
    action to recover land”. In the alternative, the application judge held that
    the proposed amendment to claim statutory rescission was not a new cause of
    action, but an alternative remedy based on the exact same facts set out by Ms.
    Yim in the original notice of application. Additionally, Ms. Yim’s e-mail sent
    on February 24, 2012 had specifically mentioned rescission under the Act. In
    these circumstances allowing the amendment would cause Talon no prejudice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    to whether the fact that Ms. Yim’s failure to use the word “rescission” in her
    February 23 letter was fatal to her claim for the return of her deposit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge started her
    analysis by noting that the Act was consumer protection legislation, and
    therefore should be interpreted liberally. The application judge reasoned, at
    para. 40, that “keeping in mind the legislature’s goal of protecting purchasers
    of condominiums, the court should not read in a requirement that all notices of
    rescission given under s. 74 of the Act include the precise term ‘rescission’.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge went on to
    hold that all s. 74(7) requires is that the notice of rescission be in writing,
    delivered to the declarant or its solicitor, and that it contain a ground of
    material change upon which rescission is based. Accordingly, the application
    judge concluded, at para. 46, that “as long as the notice fulfills the
    statutory requirements and makes clear the purchaser’s intention to undo or
    unmake the agreement, such as by requesting the return of their deposit, the
    notice should be considered sufficient”. There is no requirement that notice be
    worded perfectly, or that it include the word “rescission”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge then
    addressed whether Ms. Yim’s February 23, 2012 letter complied with this interpretation
    of s. 74 of the Act. She held that given Ms. Yim’s use of the word “terminate”
    in the letter, there must be “strong evidence” indicating that Ms. Yim’s
    intention in sending the letter was to rescind her APS. The application judge
    found three indications of the required “strong evidence” of Ms. Yim’s
    intention to rescind. First, the letter referenced a material change, namely
    the HUMA being “materially different” and containing “substantial differences”
    from projected expenses. Secondly, the application judge highlighted Ms. Yim’s
    request for the return of her deposit, a request that would restore the parties
    to their original positions. Such a remedy was consistent with rescission, and
    not with repudiation of the contract. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Thirdly, the application judge also
    looked at the e-mail sent by Ms. Yim to Talon on February 24, 2012, the day
    after the initial letter. This email had specifically referenced s. 74 of the
    Act. The application judge concluded that Ms. Yim’s communications of February
    23 and 24, read together, provided sufficient notice under the Act. Finally, in
    accordance with the requirements of s. 74(7), the letter had been in writing,
    and sent to the proper person. Given that Talon had not challenged Ms. Yim’s
    right to rescind within ten days of receipt of her notice of rescission, Talon
    was required to return her deposit, with interest.</span></p>
  <h2>Mr. Harvey v. Talon </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The first issue the application
    judge addressed was whether the application was deficient with respect to
    relief sought. In his notice of application dated February 13, 2014, Mr. Harvey
    sought a declaration that Talon was in breach of the APS, a declaration that
    the APS was terminated and of no force and effect, and an order that Talon
    return the deposit. In the alternative, he sought an order granting relief from
    forfeiture of the deposit under the APS and the return of his deposit. Talon
    argued that the application was fatally flawed because it did not claim the relief
    of rescission, and therefore the court could not conclude that Mr. Harvey’s letter
    of February 24, 2012 had been a notice of rescission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge held that it
    would defeat the purpose of r. 1 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194,<i> </i>if Mr. Harvey were precluded from pursuing relief
    on the basis that the notice of application was not framed exactly in
    accordance with the legislation or the rules. For nearly a year Talon had been
    in possession of Mr. Harvey’s affidavit, in which he had explicitly taken the
    position that his February 24, 2012 letter rescinded the APS. Further, Mr.
    Harvey had sought return of the deposit in his notice of application – relief
    consistent with the remedy of rescission, and not termination. The application
    judge reasoned that in such circumstances rescission was implicitly pleaded. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The application judge then
    addressed whether Mr. Harvey’s February 24, 2012 letter could be a proper
    notice of rescission, despite not using the word “rescind” or “rescission”. Relying
    on the same reasoning as in Ms. Yim’s case, the application judge concluded, at
    para. 43, that “as long as the notice fulfills the statutory requirements and
    makes clear the purchaser’s intention to undo or unmake the agreement, such as
    by requesting the return of their deposit, the notice should be considered
    sufficient”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Next, the application judge held
    that Mr. Harvey’s February 24, 2012 letter sufficiently conveyed his intention
    to rescind his APS. As Mr. Harvey had used the word “terminate” in his letter,
    the application judge looked for and found “strong evidence” of an intention to
    rescind. First, the letter made specific reference to the fact that the terms
    of the HUMA were materially different from the disclosure and substantially
    different from the projected expenses. Secondly, the request for a return of
    the deposit made it clear that Mr. Harvey sought to restore both parties to their
    original positions, and that he sought rescission rather than repudiation. Finally,
    the letter was in writing and was addressed to the proper person. It therefore
    complied with the requirements under s. 74 of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Mr. Harvey’s right to rescind within ten days as required under s. 74(8) of the
    Act, Mr. Harvey was entitled to the return of his deposit, with interest. </span></p>

    is no factual component to the dispute about whether the application is statute-barred.
    As analyzed below, I have concluded that the notice provided to Talon by Ms. Yim
    on February 23, 2012 was a notice of rescission under s. 74(7). Accordingly,
    the limitation period began to run ten days later, when Talon failed to return
    the deposit or make an application to Superior Court. Ms. Yim’s application was
    launched more than two years later. The sole issue is thus whether an
    application for the return of a deposit is covered by the </span></span><em>RPLA</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>, in which case the

style='line-height:200%'>, in which case the application was brought out of
    time. Answering this question requires the interpretation of s. 4 of the </span><em>RPLA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, in order to determine whether an application for
    return of deposit pursuant to s. 74 of the Act fits within the definition of an
    action for the return of land. </span></p>

    the limitation period issue is a question of law, without a factual component.

    limitation period in s. 4 of the </span></span><em>RPLA</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>, the same would be true of other

    had and lost. Rather, “recover” means to ‘obtain any land by judgment of the
    Court’” </span></p>

    Ms. Yim seeks to recover – her deposit – is “land”. The definition of land in
    s. 1 of the <em>RPLA</em> is as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>“land” includes messuages and all other hereditaments, whether
    corporeal or incorporeal, chattels and other personal property transmissible to
    heirs, money to be laid out in the purchase of land, and any share of the same
    hereditaments and properties or any of them, any estate of inheritance, or
    estate for any life or lives, or other estate transmissible to heirs, any
    possibility, right or title of entry or action, and any other interest capable
    of being inherited, whether the same estates, possibilities, rights, titles and
    interest or any of them, are in possession, reversion, remainder or
    contingency;</p>

    was also correct in concluding that an application for the return of the
    deposit was an action for the recovery of “land”; specifically the recovery of
    “money to be laid out in the purchase of land”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    application judge relied primarily upon </span><em>McConnell</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. In that case, a former common-law spouse sought a
    constructive trust giving her joint ownership of the home she had once shared
    with her former spouse, with an alternative claim for damages based on unjust
    enrichment. Rosenberg J.A., at para. 38, explained his conclusion that the <em>RPLA</em><i> </i>applied: “the respondent is making a claim for recovery of land in the
    sense that she seeks to obtain land by judgment of the court. That the claim
    might provide her with the alternative remedy of a monetary award does not take
    away from the fact that her claim is for a share of the property”. </span></p>

    as follows at para. 12 [Yim]:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Ms. Yim paid her deposit to secure an interest in land. She
    seeks to recover the money which represents that interest. I find that such an
    interest is more easily identified than a constructive trust interest (as in <em>McConnell,</em> <i>supra</i>), where the court must intervene and declare such an interest to
    exist based on certain legally accepted principles… The fact that the remedy is
    a monetary award should not preclude the court from finding that it is a
    recovery of land, as in <em>McConnell,</em> supra.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In support of this conclusion, I
    note that several cases have clarified the relationship between claims for
    damages and claims covered by the <em>RPLA</em>. The Supreme Court in <em>Canson
    Enterprises Ltd. v. Boughton &amp; Co.</em>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 534, defined
    damages as “a monetary payment for the invasion of a right at common law”. In <em>Toronto
    Standard Condominium Corp. No. 1487 v. Market Lofts Inc.</em>, 2015 ONSC 1067,
    the plaintiff sought damages based off the defendant’s failure to meet its
    obligations under a Shared Services Agreement. Perell J., beginning at para.
    49, noted that the fact that real property is incidentally involved in an
    action does not necessarily mean that the action is governed by the <em>RPLA</em>.
    Among the cases he cited was <em>Metropolitan Toronto Condominium Corp. No.
    1067 v. L. Chung Development Co.</em>, 2012 ONCA 845. In that case, this Court
    made the following comment, at para. 7: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Finally, we do not think that the [<i>RPLA</i>] applies to the
    case as framed by the appellant. In its Statement of Claim, the appellant frames
    its action as one for damages flowing from the respondents' negligence, breach
    of contract, conflict of interest, and breach of duty of care, fiduciary duty
    and statutory duty. None of these relates to the categories of actions
    encompassed by the [<i>RPLA</i>]. </p>

    primarily seeking damages, for example breach of contract, her application would
    be statute-barred. This would be true even if the claim for damages
    incidentally related to real property, specifically the condominium that was
    the subject of her APS. Claims for damages do not fit within the definition of
    “land” in the </span><em>RPLA</em><i><span style='line-height:200%'>.</span></i><span

    damages. She advances a specific claim under a provision in the Act, a
    provision that only allows for the return of her deposit and interest, not
    damages. The Tax Court defined a deposit in </span><em>Casa Blanca Homes Ltd.
    v. R.</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, 2013 TCC 338, as “a pool of money
    retained until such time as it is applied in partial payment or forfeited”. As
    noted by the Alberta Court of Appeal in <em>Lozcal Holdings Ltd. v. Brassos
    Development Ltd</em><i>. </i>(1980), 111 D.L.R. (3d) 598, “a genuine deposit
    ordinarily has nothing to do with damages, except that credit must be given for
    the amount of the deposit in calculating damages”. </span></p>

    of “money to be laid out in the purchase of land”, a phrase on which there is
    scant jurisprudence. However, in my view an action for the return of a deposit
    fits comfortably within its plain meaning. Frankly, I struggle to understand
    what would fit within this phrase if not an action such as this. </span></p>

    analysis, I conclude that Ms. Yim’s application is not statute-barred. This is
    also true of the amendment of her initial application to specifically claim
    statutory rescission. As her application is covered by s. 4 of the <em>RPLA</em>,
    the applicable limitation period is ten years. The application is an action,
    which is defined as any civil action. She seeks “recovery”, which has been
    defined as “gaining through a judgment or order”. And the recovery she seeks is
    of “land”; namely, her deposit, which is money laid out in the purchase of
    land. </span></p>

  <h2>Issue 3: Did Ms. Yim’s and Mr. Harvey’s communications to Talon constitute
    notices to rescind for the purposes of s. 74 of the Act?</h2>
  <h3>The Parties’ Submissions</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    judge ignored the clear wording of the communications sent by Ms. Yim and Mr.
    Harvey, which both reference “termination” of the APS. In finding that the Act
    does not prescribe a statutory form of a notice of rescission, the application
    judge failed to recognize that the Act specifically refers only and repeatedly
    to a “notice of rescission”. There is an important legal distinction between
    termination and rescission. A party cannot assert inconsistent rights and
    having terminated the APS, the respondents cannot claim rescission of an
    agreement they have already terminated. Talon submits that the respondents themselves
    were in breach of the APS by terminating.</span></p>

    application judge correctly interpreted the requirements for rescission under
    the Act. An examination of the object of the Act and the intention of the
    legislature supports a liberal interpretation of the phrase “notice of
    rescission”. As long as the notice is in writing, sent to the right person,
    sets out a ground of material change upon which rescission is based, and makes
    clear the intention of a purchaser to unmake a transaction, it should be
    sufficient. A purchaser should not be required to explicitly use the term
    “rescission”, if the notice nonetheless makes it sufficiently clear that this
    is what is sought. </span></p>

    Court and the Supreme Court have identified guidelines for how consumer
    protection legislation is to be interpreted. The application judge referred to <em>Seidel

    proposition that consumer protection legislation must be interpreted generously
    in favour of the consumer. This proposition comes directly from Binnie J., who
    was considering the British Columbia <em>Business Practices and Consumer
    Protection Act</em><i> </i>(the “<em>BCPCA</em>”). At para. 37, he noted that
    the statutory purpose of the <em>BCPCA</em><i> </i>was all about consumer
    protection. As such, its terms should be interpreted generously in favour of
    consumers. Another relevant Supreme Court case is <em>Celgane Corp v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</em>, 2011 SCC 1, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 3. In that case, the Court was considering
    the Federal Court’s interpretation of a price-regulating provision in the <em>Patent
    Act</em>. Abella J. adopted the majority view of Evans J.A., who had held that
    because the provision could be interpreted in different ways, the one that best
    implemented the consumer protection objectives of such price-regulating
    provisions was the correct interpretation. </span></p>

    of the Act provides further support for the identification of the statutory
    scheme dealing with rescission as consumer protection legislation. In <em>Abdool
    v. Somerset Place Developments of Georgetown Ltd.</em> (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 120
    (C.A.), Robins J.A. discussed s. 52 of the <em>Condominium Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C. 26, which was roughly equivalent to s. 74 under the current Act. This
    provision allowed a purchaser to rescind an APS within ten days of receiving a
    material amendment to a disclosure statement, by giving “written notice of
    rescission” to the declarant or his or her solicitor. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Act</em><i> </i>was initially enacted in 1967 (S.O. 1967, c. 12), it imposed no
    disclosure requirements on developers, and provided little protection to
    purchasers. The predecessor to s. 52 (and thus the ultimate predecessor of the
    current s. 74) was first enacted as part of the 1974 amendments to the <em>Condominium
    Act</em> (S.O. 1974, c. 133, s. 14). This provision introduced the concept of
    full disclosure into the Act. However, consumers apparently continued to
    experience problems. This led to further amendments in 1978 (S.O. 1978, c. 84),
    introducing s. 52, which was later carried over into the 1990 Act. In
    introducing the 1978 Act in the Legislature on June 1, 1978, Larry Grossman,
    the Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations, described it as a “form of
    consumer protection legislation”. He stated that the Act would provide
    purchaser protection to consumers by requiring &quot;tighter standards of
    disclosure between sellers and purchasers; allowing time for purchasers to
    become informed of their responsibilities; and clarifying purchasers' rights
    during the interim occupancy period”. </span></p>

    discussing what was required in the disclosure from the declarant, Robins J.A.
    made the following comments: “the vagueness of the requirements and the absence
    of statutory guidelines mandate a broad and flexible approach – not a rigid or
    stringent one – in determining whether a given disclosure statement is
    adequate”. In my view, there is no reason why this reasoning about disclosure
    required from the vendor should not also be applied to the purchaser, in
    determining whether a given notice of rescission is adequate. </span></p>

    dissimilar to that found in the Act. The franchisee can exercise its right to
    rescind by providing the franchisor with a “notice of rescission” within specified
    timeframes, where the franchisor provides late disclosure, or no disclosure.
    Following reception of such a notice, the franchisor has certain obligations

    method, at the franchisor’s address for service, or to any other person

    in detail in <em>779975 Ontario Ltd. v. Mmmuffins Canada Corp.</em>, 2009
    CarswellOnt 3262 (S.C.), by Strathy J. (as he then was). In that case, the
    franchisee started an action for common law rescission, based on alleged
    pre-contractual misrepresentations made by the franchisor. The statement of
    claim made no mention of the <em>AWA</em><i> </i>or of the statutory rescission
    remedy. More than two years later the franchisee commenced a second action,
    asking for a declaration that service of the statement of claim in the earlier
    action had been a “notice of rescission” under the <em>AWA</em>, thus
    interrupting the limitation period. At para. 45, Strathy J reasoned as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>While s. 6 of the <i>AWA </i>does not specify the contents of
    the notice of rescission, it seems to me that the notice must at least be
    sufficient to bring home to the franchisor that the franchisee is exercising
    its statutory rights of rescission under the <i>AWA</i>, and to inform the
    franchisor that the clock has begun to run on the 60-day period in s. 6(6). In
    light of the very substantial obligations on franchisors to compensate
    franchisees for breach of the disclosure duty, the franchisor is entitled to
    know whether a violation of the&nbsp;<i>AWA</i>&nbsp;is being alleged and
    whether the franchisee is claiming remedies under that statute. The franchisor
    is not able to fulfill its statutory obligations unless the notice is at least
    adequate to inform it that the franchisee has rescinded the agreement. <u>The
    notice does not have to be in specific language, but it must at least make it
    clear that the franchisee is exercising its statutory right to rescind the
    franchise agreement and demanding the compensation to which it is entitled.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

    Strathy J. concluded that the statement of claim in the first action was not
    sufficient to constitute “notice of rescission” to the franchisor within the
    meaning of the <em>AWA</em>. The statement of claim made no reference to the <em>AWA</em>,
    nor to the franchisor’s failure to provide a disclosure document or statement
    of material change in time or at all, and there was nothing to indicate to the
    franchisor that the franchisee was claiming the relief set out in s. 6(6). The
    statement of claim did not purport to be an exercise of a statutory right by
    the franchisee – on the contrary, it was simply an action for rescission and
    damages that had nothing to do with the <em>AWA</em>. </span></p>

    provides support for the application judge’s conclusion that a notice of
    rescission under the Act does not need to include the word “rescind” or
    “rescission”, or reference the relevant section of the Act. As Strathy J. made
    clear, the notice “does not have to be in specific language”. What is required
    is that the notice indicates that the purchaser is exercising his or her statutory
    authority to “rescind” or “unmake” the APS based on a material change. Where
    the notice achieves this, the declarant can decide whether to apply to the
    Superior Court for a determination of the materiality of the change set out. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I agree with the application
    judge’s interpretation that a notice of rescission pursuant to s. 74(7) of the
    Act does not require the use of the words “rescind” or “rescission”. As
    previously indicated, the Act is well established to be consumer protection
    legislation. It therefore must be interpreted generously in a manner that
    protects consumers. Consumers will not always be represented by counsel.
    Consumers will not always be familiar with words such as rescission and rescind.
    For consumers to be on a level playing field with developers in accessing the
    respective rights afforded them under the Act, they must be given considerable leeway
    in their use of language. As long as the purchaser’s intention to undo the
    transaction based on a material change is clear, that is sufficient. That is
    all the declarant needs to understand in order to take advantage of the
    statutory rights then available to it. </span></p>
  <h4><span style='text-decoration:none'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did the respondents' correspondence constitute notice of
    rescission?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Given I agree with the application
    judge’s view of the requirements of s. 74(7) of the Act, the final question to
    be asked is whether there is any reason to interfere with her conclusion that
    Ms. Yim’s and Mr. Harvey’s correspondence met these requirements. For the
    reasons that follow, I see no reason to interfere with the application judge’s
    determination that the notices provided were sufficient to qualify as “notices
    of rescission”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It is true that both notices utilized
    the word “terminate”. However, both also included repeated requests that the
    deposit be returned. As the application judge noted (para. 56 of Mr. Harvey, 54
    of Ms. Yim), return of deposit is a remedy consistent with rescission, and not
    with repudiation. As well, both notices referred to the materially different
    terms contained in the HUMA as a basis for undoing the transaction. The HUMA had
    just been disclosed to Ms. Yim and Mr. Harvey a few days before their
    respective notices. They were well within the window to claim rescission based
    on a material change. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Turning first to Ms. Yim, although
    it is true that she was represented by counsel, I do not see how this factor is
    relevant to a determination of whether the notice was sufficiently clear that
    Ms. Yim wanted to undo the transaction based on a material change. Regardless,
    Ms. Yim’s counsel wrote a follow-up email to Talon the day after the initial
    notice, making it clear that rescission pursuant to s. 74(7) of the Act was
    being sought. In my view, considering these factors as a whole, it was
    reasonable for the application judge to conclude that the notice provided in
    the case of Ms. Yim was sufficient to meet the requirements of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I also agree with the application
    judge (para. 53 of Ms. Yim appeal) that the issue here is not whether the
    change to the HUMA actually was a material change. That issue does not come
    into play. Talon received valid notices of rescission under the Act, based on
    an alleged material change in the HUMA. Talon had ten days to make an
    application to Superior Court for a determination as to whether the alleged
    material change was in fact material. Having failed to do so, it is now too
    late for Talon to argue that the change was not material. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    to this argument in the appeal involving Ms. Yim. Her notice was a valid notice
    of rescission under the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The case of Mr. Harvey warrants a
    similar analysis and the same conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Harvey’s letter of February 24
    did not contain the word rescind, and did not reference s. 74 of the Act. Nor
    did he provide a follow-up communication the next day, unlike Ms. Yim. However,
    his letter did contain information sufficient to bring home to the declarant
    that s. 74 was being engaged. As noted by the application judge, Mr. Harvey
    both asked for the return of his deposit, and relied on the material differences
    in the HUMA. Given this, I see no error in the application judge’s conclusion that
    Mr. Harvey’s letter met the requirements under s. 74 of the Act. It was a valid
    notice of rescission. </span></p>

    have concluded that the application judge committed no errors of law in
    interpreting the Act, nor palpable and overriding errors in applying the law to
    the facts of this case. Accordingly, her conclusion that the notices provided
    were sufficient should not be disturbed on appeal. Given that both applications
    were commenced within the time required, Ms. Yim and Mr. Harvey are both entitled
    to an order requiring Talon to refund their deposits with interest, in
    accordance with s. 74(9) of the Act.</span></span></p>
