style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issues on appeal relate to orders made on a change motion
    brought by the wife after the husband accepted an early retirement package from
    his employer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first issue concerns whether the motion judge erred in
    terminating the child support payable for the parties’ youngest child. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second issue concerns whether the motion judge erred in
    determining the additional spousal support payable to the wife based on the
    husband’s increased income due to receiving an early pension payout. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The parties married in 1984 and separated in 2007, after almost
    23 years of marital cohabitation. They have three children, born in January
    1987, June 1989 and January 1992, respectively. The marriage was a traditional
    marriage, in which the wife stopped working shortly before the first child was
    born and thereafter remained in the home to care for the children and manage
    the household.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In June 2008, the parties entered into a separation agreement.
    Among other things, the separation agreement provided that the husband would
    pay child support to the wife until “one” of certain specified events occurred
    with respect to any of the children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The separation agreement also provided that the husband would pay
    spousal support to the wife, subject to variation based on a material change in
    circumstances, which could include an increase in the husband’s income beyond
    $145,000, a change in the number of children being supported or the husband’s “cessation
    of employment prior to age 65”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In August 2012, at the age of 53, the husband accepted an early
    retirement package from his employer under which he resigned from his
    employment and elected to receive the commuted value of his pension, totaling
    $1,943,000.07 including interest,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> payable in six instalments on September 1st of each year commencing September
    1, 2012. The monies were paid partly as taxable income ($1,296,167.01, payable
    in six instalments) and partly into a locked-in retirement account (“LIRA”)
    ($646,833.06, payable in six instalments). Soon after his resignation, the husband
    began working as a consultant for his former employer, billing his time out at
    $115 to $125 per hour.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband terminated child support payments for the youngest
    child effective December 1, 2012. As of that date, the child was 20 years old,
    had completed her full-time studies in early childhood education and was one
    credit short of obtaining a certificate in that program. The child subsequently
    re-took the credit and obtained her certificate in May 2013.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The change motion was launched in April 2013, heard in October
    2014 and February 2015 and determined on March 31, 2015.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons, the motion judge found that the parties’ youngest
    child was not entitled to support under the separation agreement after December
    1, 2012 as the child was by then over the age of 18 years and had ceased
    full-time attendance at an educational institution – one of the triggering
    events for termination under the separation agreement. The motion judge went on
    to conclude that the child was no longer a child of the marriage within the
    meaning of the <em>Divorce Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3, (2nd Supp.), as she was
    over the age of majority and “not unable to obtain the necessaries of life.” He
    therefore dismissed the wife’s claim for retroactive and ongoing child support
    as of January 1, 2013.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As for spousal support, the motion judge accepted that there had
    been a material change in circumstances based on the husband’s early
    retirement, his increased income and the change in the number of children
    entitled to support. He noted that this was not a case involving proposed
    “double-dipping” from assets that had already been part of an equalization process<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and that one of the issues he had to determine was the extent to which the
    early pension payout had already been equalized. The motion judge found that
    the capital value of the portion of the husband’s pension payout that had not
    previously been subject to equalization amounted to $575,470 after-tax. However,
    he concluded that the wife was entitled to claim against only one half of that
    amount for purposes of spousal support, which he added to the husband’s income,
    which he calculated as $57,000 after-tax annually (less an unspecified
    deduction for pre-marriage service), payable over five years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the motion judge found that the husband’s total annual
    income, including $57,500<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></span></a> on account of his early pension payout, produced a range, under the <em>Spousal
    Support Advisory Guidelines</em><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> (“Guidelines”), of roughly $6,000 to $8,000 per month for 2012 and 2013, the
    motion judge chose not to award Guidelines support. Instead, he increased the
    spousal support payable to the wife under the separation agreement by $2,350
    per month, for a total of $5,000 per month, commencing September 1, 2012. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the motion judge’s view, while the wife had contributed to the
    husband’s ability to receive the income at issue, there was also an element of
    luck involved in the husband’s employer’s decision to make the early pension
    payout available. Moreover, the motion judge found that the wife had mismanaged
    her finances and that her expenses of approximately $88,000 per year were unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal as it
    relates to child support but allow the appeal as it relates to spousal support.</p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Child Support Issue</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wife submits that the motion judge erred in determining that
    the youngest child no longer qualified for child support under the separation
    agreement as of January 1, 2013 or, in the alternative, that she was no longer
    a child of the marriage within the meaning of the <em>Divorce Act</em>. She
    asks for an order that the husband pay retroactive child support for the period
    January 1, 2013 to May 1, 2013 based on the husband’s taxable income for 2013
    plus the $57,000 imputed to the husband by the motion judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wife contends that, under the terms of the separation
    agreement, the husband was obliged to continue supporting the child until the
    child obtained one post-secondary degree. In the alternative, she argues that,
    because the child remained dependent on the wife, the motion judge erred in
    finding that the child no longer qualified as a child of the marriage under the <em>Divorce Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not accept these submissions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The relevant portions of paragraph 12 of the separation agreement
    read as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>12. …The parties agree that <span class=Underline>the Husband’s
    obligation to pay child support to the Wife shall continue until one of the
    following occurs</span> with respect to any of the Children:</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>b. <span class=Underline>the Child becomes 18 years of age and
    ceases to be in full-time attendance (except for school vacations) at an
    educational institution</span>;</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>c. <span class=Underline>the
    Child obtains one post-secondary educational degree or diploma or turns twenty-three
    years of age, whichever occurs first</span>. In the event that the Child turns
    23 years of age and has not yet completed her undergraduate degree or diploma,
    then the child support shall continue until the end of that year, provided that
    the Child is carrying a full course load;</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>f. the Child dies; <span
class=Underline>or</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>g. the Child ceases to be a
    “child of the marriage” as defined in the <em>Divorce Act</em> or the <em>Guidelines</em>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wife asserts that the terms of this provision should be
    interpreted broadly to benefit the parties’ children. As paragraph 12(c) does
    not stipulate that a child is required to be in full-time attendance at an
    educational institution, she maintains that the husband was not entitled to
    terminate support for the youngest child so long as the child was pursuing a
    post-secondary degree (including a certificate) and had not yet reached the age
    of 23.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree. Each of the sub-paragraphs in paragraph 12 is a
    triggering event that stipulates conditions under which the husband can
    terminate child support. The sub-paragraphs do not require the husband to
    continue paying child support where one of the sub-paragraphs has been
    triggered just because all of the conditions of another sub-paragraph have not
    been fulfilled. Sub-paragraph 12(b) is clear. It permitted the husband to
    terminate child support for the youngest child once she had attained the age of
    18 years and ceased full time attendance at an educational institution. The
    fact that the child had not yet obtained a post-secondary educational degree or
    diploma or attained the age of 23 years as required to trigger sub-paragraph
    12(c) was irrelevant to the triggering event upon which the husband relied. </p>

    child of the marriage within the meaning the <em>Divorce Act</em>, the motion
    judge relied on the fact that the child completed her full-time studies in
    December 2012 and that between January and May 2013 she was re-taking only one
    credit. Subsequently, the child remained at home to assist her mother and
    grandmother and also began an online program of continuing education in equine
    studies. Although not in the form of an affidavit, there was material before
    the motion judge suggesting the child was working part-time as a stable hand
    while pursuing her online studies. However, there was no indication of what the
    child was earning. </p>

    In the result, he arrived at  a value of $843,603 (the “2012 valuation”) – as
    compared to his 2007 valuation of $268,133. In his opinion, this meant that the
    ratio of $268,133 divided by $843,603 - or 31.78% - of the commuted value of
    the pension had been equalized, whereas 68.22% of the commuted value of the
    pension had not been equalized.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

    approach to the matter might be to deem the husband to be receiving the early
    pension payout in the form of an annual lifetime income stream. 68.22% of this
    amount could then be treated as available for spousal support. In that case,
    the unequalized portion of the husband’s pension payments would total
    $49,865.56 prior to August 1, 2024, and $43,220.33 thereafter.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his report, Mr. Norton explained that his 2012 valuation
    included amounts for “retirement date earlier than assumed” and for
    pre-marriage and post-separation service, but effectively left unchanged the
    assumptions from 2007 about mortality, interest and tax.  </p>

    that the figures attributable to each factor only applied if you did the
    calculations in the order in which DSW set out the factors. If you did the
    calculations in a different order, the number attributable to each factor, but
    not the total, would change. Moreover, because “retirement age earlier than
    assumed” was the first factor in DSW’s ordering, the value attributed to that
    factor would never decrease if the ordering changed – rather, it would only
    become larger. In Mr. Norton’s view, no particular order is correct. </p>

    Following the October 21-22, 2014 hearing, the motion judge issued an
    endorsement on November 26, 2014 indicating he was satisfied that there had
    been a material change in circumstances such that spousal support should be
    varied and that the claim for child support should be dismissed. However, he
    indicated that he was left with certain questions concerning the expert

    assistance, to determine what ordering of the factors in the appendix to DSW’s
    second report would be best in this case. He was also uncertain whether to
    accept the percentage difference between equalized and unequalized amounts as
    set out in Mr. Norton’s report. The motion judge indicated that he had not yet
    made a decision about whether the Guidelines should apply, but noted that the
    parties had not made submissions concerning mean-and-needs based support. Accordingly,
    he asked whether he should receive further expert evidence, and requested
    submissions on what the spousal support should be if the Guidelines did not
    apply.</p>

    she had lost her job. He went on to receive further submissions from counsel

    purchased a two-storey, four-bedroom house for $442,000. To finance the house,
    she used her equalization payment and also obtained a mortgage for $287,300 at
    an interest rate of prime less 0.6%. In May 2012 she obtained a new mortgage
    from the Royal Bank under which she could borrow up to $350,000 at a rate of
    prime plus 7%. She had two lines of credit totaling almost $100,000, credit
    card debts totaling over $10,000 and unpaid income and property taxes of
    approximately $10,000. Despite these issues, her financial statement indicated
    she had ten cats and five dogs costing approximately $755 per month to

    hearing, the wife’s counsel sought support at the high end of the Guidelines
    range based on Mr. Norton’s alternate proposal, namely that $49,865.56 per year
    should be imputed to the husband on account of unequalized pension income prior
    to August 1, 2024, and $43,220.33 per year thereafter.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband’s counsel acknowledged that two of the factors as
    identified in the appendix to the second DSW report could be considered on the
    motion to change spousal support, namely, increases in pension value due to
    pre- and post-separation service and retirement age earlier than assumed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband’s counsel asked that the value of the unequalized
    portion of the pension be fixed at $469,500: one-half of the increased value of
    the pension attributable to early retirement in the appendix to the second DSW
    report ($433,000 ÷ 2 = $216,500) plus the increase in value of the pension due
    to post-separation service ($253,000). The husband’s counsel requested that this
    sum of $469,500 be added to the husband’s income, spread over five years, for a
    total of $93,900 per year. </p>

    appropriate case for lump sum support. Using the $93,900 figure, he submitted a
    Guidelines calculation based on a “with child support formula”, which produced
    a lump sum support range of $116,711 to $173,805, subject to a credit for
    $25,000, paid in advance, after-tax. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wife claimed monthly expenses of approximately $88,000.
    Having regard to those expenses, her counsel advanced what he termed “three
    scenarios”. The first two scenarios addressed support for 2013 to 2017 and characterized
    the husband’s pension income differently in each. The first two scenarios also addressed
    two different splits of the parties’ net disposable incomes (“NDI”). Both of
    these scenarios were premised on the wife having an annual income of $6,770. The
    third scenario addressed child and spousal support for 2012.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The first scenario was premised on the husband’s total taxable
    income for 2013 ($329,480), which excluded amounts transferred to the LIRA. Based
    on a 50/50 NDI split, the first scenario yielded Guidelines monthly support of
    $13,862; based on a 52/48<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span

style='line-height:200%'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her second scenario, the wife relied on Mr. Norton’s alternate
    characterization of the unequalized portion of the pension, under which he
    imputed $49,866 into the husband’s income until 2024 and $43,220.33 from 2025
    onwards on account of the unequalized portion of the pension. Adding the
    $49,866 unequalized portion of the pension to the husband’s other income
    sources of $194,548 resulted in a total 2014 income of $244,414. Based on a
    50/50 NDI split, the second scenario yielded Guidelines monthly support of
    $10,284; based on a 52/48 NDI split, the second scenario yielded Guidelines
    monthly support of $9,755. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I have said, the third scenario addressed child and spousal
    support for 2012 and reflected the $688,139 that the husband received from his
    employer upon retirement. The husband’s total income for 2012 was thus $855,919
    as per his T1 tax statement (which excluded amounts transferred to a LIRA).
    Under this scenario, spousal support ranged from $13,299 to $14,894 per month.
    However, the wife’s counsel acknowledged that although the husband received a lump
    sum of $688,139 cash pension payout in 2012, only $49,866 (i.e. the imputed unequalized
    pension income on which the wife relied) ought to be considered for the
    purposes of spousal support since a portion of the pension had already been
    equalized. On this calculation, the husband’s income in 2012 totalled $218,903
    and spousal support ranged from $2,955 to $3,392.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to reviewing the scenarios, the wife’s counsel submitted
    that spousal support should be fixed at approximately $13,000 per month
    commencing January 1, 2013, subject to a credit for amounts paid by the husband,
    including a $25,000 advance paid in December 2013, plus 2012 arrears.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband’s counsel submitted that the wife’s budget of
    approximately $7,500 per month was excessive and should be reduced to $4,800
    per month, including notional income taxes. He reiterated his previous
    submissions that the only portions of the husband’s pension payments that
    should be included in the husband’s income for the purposes of determining
    support were: i) the increased pension amount attributable to post-separation
    service; and ii) one-half of the increased pension amount attributable to early
    retirement. He argued that the wife had bargained away her share of the
    increased pension amount attributable to early retirement when she agreed to an
    equalization based on an age 65 retirement valuation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although it does not form part of the appeal record, it appears

style='line-height:200%'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This calculation apparently produced what the husband’s counsel
    submitted was a Guidelines range for increased spousal support of between $1,397
    and $1,863 per month. In the end, the husband’s counsel acknowledged that his
    client could pay increased spousal support at the high end of this range. He
    submitted that to the extent this left any shortfall in the wife’s budget, she
    should be able to contribute that amount.</p>

    husband’s early retirement brought about a material change in circumstances
    that would allow for a variation of the existing support order and the
    separation agreement. He concluded that under the separation agreement, as
    confirmed by the consent court orders, the following matters could amount to a
    material change in circumstances and that all had occurred: the husband’s early
    retirement; an increase in the husband’s income; and a change in the number of
    children entitled to child support.</p>

    pension value of $575,470: $843,603, the after-tax value in the 2012 valuation,
    minus $268,133, the after-tax value in the 2007 valuation. The husband had
    submitted that, at most, the unequalized value was $321,072<a href="#_ftn15"

    the difference between the two after-tax pension values referred to in Mr.
    Norton’s 2007 valuation, namely, $589,205 (the after-tax value based on the early
    retirement date) minus $268,133 (the after-tax value based on the age 65

style='line-height:200%'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge concluded that he could not rely on the DSW
    valuation because it was too subjective and uncertain. Although he had concerns
    about Mr. Norton’s opinion, he concluded that he could accept it, subject to
    making a deduction for pre-marriage service, which he found had been four and
    one-half months. The motion judge concluded that the unequalized value of the
    husband’s pension equated to $57,000 after-tax over five years, after deducting
    an amount for pre-marriage service:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It must be kept in mind that, to the extent that the pension
    has increased in value, [the wife] is only entitled to claim against half of
    it. If the full value that we now have had been added to [the husband’s] net
    family property at separation, [the wife] would only get a credit for half of
    it.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>And finally, the increased amount is being paid out over five
    years. So the amount to vary spousal support over those years becomes less
    significant.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Result</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I find that the value of the unequalized portion of [the

    post-separation increases in a payor’s income, the motion judge concluded, at
    para. 106, that:</p>

    principles including s. 17(7) of the <em>Divorce Act</em>; the Guidelines
    factors that could result in high end spousal support; and principles from

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the motion judge found that, if $57,500 were added to
    the husband’s annual income, the Guidelines would produce a range for spousal
    support of between $6,000 and $8,000 per month, he concluded that two factors
    in particular made the “underlying assumptions of the [Guidelines] less
    helpful.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Those factors were, first, the fact that there was some element
    of luck unrelated to the wife’s contributions to the husband’s career inherent
    in the husband’s opportunity to obtain the early pension payout. But for the
    opportunity to retire early, the husband may have continued to work as
    anticipated in the separation agreement. In the motion judge’s view, the
    husband’s early pension payout “should not be an opportunity for the court to
    revisit [the wife’s] financial decisions after separation.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second factor was that the wife had been mismanaging her
    affairs since separation and had been unreasonable with her expenses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge then turned to the factors identified in s. 17
    (7) of the <em>Divorce Act</em>. While acknowledging the wife’s contribution to
    the husband’s professional success, the motion judge could not see any
    continuing factor relating to the care of the children “other than to the
    extent that [the wife] took care of the children to allow [the husband’s]
    success.” Further, the motion judge concluded that the economic hardship the
    wife was suffering did not arise from the breakdown of the marriage but, rather,
    from her mismanagement of the equalization payment in 2008. In his view, “[e]ffectively
    requiring [the husband] to pay [the wife’s] debts would not promote economic
    self-sufficiency.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge found that the wife’s debt load could be paid
    off by downsizing “both with respect to her house and her desire to support
    those around her” and that, “[w]ith that, I am confident that spousal support
    of $5,000.00 per month as of September 1, 2012 would provide the appropriate
    support going forward.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, the motion judge held that for the years 2012
    through 2017, the parties could impute the sum of $57,000 annually to the
    husband’s income and that the husband should pay spousal support to the wife in
    the amount of $5,000 per month commencing September 1, 2012.</p>

    judge erred in failing to recognize that the wife was “crossing over” from the
    “with child formula” to the “without child” formula and therefore that the
    support she was receiving under the separation agreement was significantly
    lower than the support to which she would otherwise have been entitled. </p>

style='line-height:200%'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wife also argues that the motion judge placed undue emphasis

    acquire a permanent residence for herself and the children using the proceeds
    of equalization payment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The standard of review on support issues is highly deferential.
    Appellate courts should not interfere with support orders unless the reasons
    “disclose an error in principle, a significant misapprehension of the evidence,
    or unless the award is clearly wrong”: <em>Hickey v. Hickey</em>, [1999] 2
    S.C.R. 518, at paras. 11-12.</p>
  <h2>(8)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Analysis </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would allow the appeal of the spousal support award. In my
    view, the motion judge erred in principle in his approach and arrived at an
    amount that was clearly wrong. I say this for two main reasons.</p>
  <h5 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Erroneous Departure from the Guidelines</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span style='line-height:200%'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As already mentioned, the Guidelines, while not binding, should
    not be lightly departed from. This is in large part because, without them, it
    is very difficult to establish a principled basis for arriving at a figure for spousal
    support. In my view, the motion judge erred in departing from the Guidelines
    for the reasons he did: namely, the good luck associated with the husband’s
    early pension pay-out opportunity (at para. 140) and his finding that the wife
    was “mismanaging her affairs” (at para.150). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the face of a very strong compensatory basis for entitlement
    to support, as well as an income increase arising from the very same job that
    the husband occupied throughout the 23-year-long traditional marriage, there
    was simply no reason to conclude that “the underlying assumptions of the SSAGs
    [were now] less helpful” (para.151).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wife was a stay-at-home mother in an approximately 23-year
    marriage. The husband does not dispute that his career flourished, at least in part,
    because the wife assumed responsibility for child care and household
    management. A significant amount of the unequalized portion of the early
    pension payout was earned while the parties cohabited. Post-separation earnings
    were achieved at the level at which they were, at least in part, because of the
    wife’s contribution to the husband’s career. The wife did not argue for a <em>Boston
    v. Boston</em> exception to permit double dipping at this time. In these
    circumstances, the good fortune involved in the early pension payout should
    accrue, at least to some extent, to both parties, particularly where, as here,
    the parties agreed they would share post-separation changes in income.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As for the wife’s expenses, before turning to his analysis of the
    unequalized portion of the pension issue, the motion judge cited <em>Boston v. Boston</em> for the proposition that “where a pension is equalized by way of a lump sum
    payment, the payee is under an obligation to use those assets in an
    income-producing way … to create an ‘pension’ to provide for her future.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, <em>Boston</em> does not require the payee spouse to
    immediately invest the equalization assets. Instead, she must use them to
    generate income by the time the pension-holding spouse retires: see <em>Boston</em> at para. 54. In this case, the wife had no opportunity to comply with this
    requirement because the husband opted for early retirement. In any event,
    however, to the extent that the motion judge relied on the proposition he
    stated in assessing the reasonableness of the wife’s choice to purchase a
    four-bedroom house with her share of the equalization payment to provide a home
    for herself and the children before the husband’s pension came into pay, he
    misstated the principle enunciated in <em>Boston</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, given the length of the marriage, her role in it and
    her age, the wife is entitled to spousal support on a level commensurate with
    the standard of living the parties enjoyed during the marriage. As chronicled
    in the separation agreement, while cohabiting, the parties lived in a house
    that sold for one million dollars. It was not unreasonable for the wife to
    purchase a home that would accommodate her and the children before the pension
    came into pay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, whether viewed cumulatively or in isolation, the good
    fortune involved in the husband receiving an early pension payout and the
    wife’s financial decisions did not justify the motion judge in departing from
    the ranges of Guidelines support he was considering. </p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Misunderstanding of the Guidelines Ranges when using them as his “Check”</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having, in my view, decided in error that the wife should receive
    support below the lowest range suggested by the Guidelines, the motion judge
    still used the Guidelines as a “check” on his own figures (para.106). In so
    doing, however, he significantly misapprehended the numbers that the Guidelines
    would generate in this case. In this way, he not only erred in deciding that
    the wife should receive support below the lowest Guidelines range, he then
    calculated a Guidelines number that was itself far too low. This compounded the
    initial error and led him to accept a means and needs formulation for the
    spousal support award that was far too low and clearly wrong. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In calculating the Guidelines support amount that would serve as
    his “check”, the motion judge made at least two significant errors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, he erred in overlooking the fact that this is a “cross-over”
    case. Given that the motion judge terminated child support, spousal support had
    to be determined using the “without child support” formula under the
    Guidelines, rather than the “with child support” formula. Inherent in that
    change is a recognition that the spousal support the wife was receiving under
    the “with child support” formula was <em>lower</em> than the support to which
    she would have been entitled under the “without child support” formula. Thus,
    even without the increase in income due to the unequalized pension payout, the
    spousal support to which the wife was entitled was higher in any event. This
    was due at least in part to the fact that this was a cross-over case. (The
    husband’s income had also increased.) In any event, the motion judge did not
    advert to the fact that it was a cross-over case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Without that acknowledgment, the starting point from which the
    motion judge assessed the wife’s spousal support entitlement was too low: see
    Guidelines at c.14.5.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, based on the record that is before us, it appears that
    the motion judge significantly misapprehended the parties’ positions on the
    Guidelines inputs. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the question of how much of the pension payout had already
    been equalized, the motion judge said that the wife’s position was that support
    should be based on an unequalized pension value of $575,470 (the after-tax
    value of $843,603 in 2012 minus the after-tax value of $268,133 in 2007). He
    also said that the husband’s position was that, at most, the unequalized value
    of the pension was $321,072<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[16]</span></span></span></a> (the difference between the after-tax early retirement option and the after-tax
    age 65 retirement option, as valued in 2007). Neither statement is correct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither the wife nor Mr. Norton relied on $575,470 as the
    unequalized value of the early pension payout that should be used to determine
    the quantum of spousal support. Rather, Mr. Norton developed a ratio as his
    primary assessment of the unequalized value of the pension and posited, as an
    alternative, the amounts of the pre-tax annual payments that would have
    represented the unequalized value of the pension had the husband elected to
    receive his pension. The wife relied on those pre-tax alternative values to
    make her Guidelines submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband advocated a maximum pre-tax value of $469,500 as the
    unequalized portion of the pension.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[17]</span></span></span></a> He calculated this figure using pre-tax values from the appendix to the second
    DSW report: one-half of the additional value attributable to early retirement
    plus the value of post-retirement service. <span style='line-height:200%'>Ultimately,
    the motion judge chose not to rely on the DSW report. Moreover, he rejected the
    husband’s argument that the wife had given up her claim to half of the added
    value attributable to early-retirement based on the terms of the contract. In
    this regard, the motion judge noted that while both early retirement date and
    age 65 valuations existed when the separation agreement was negotiated, the
    separation agreement preserved early retirement as a potential material change
    in circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> No one suggested the approach that the motion judge took: namely
    to use after-tax values of a capital asset to calculate the income available
    for spousal support. And since the Guidelines generate spousal support ranges
    based on pre-tax income, it is difficult to see how the motion judge could then
    have appropriately used the Guidelines as a “check” on his own figures.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, in my view, taking account of the parties’ actual
    submissions, at a minimum, the motion judge erred in using after-tax income
    inputs to assess the available income for support purposes given the
    Guidelines’ use of pre-tax inputs to generate their ranges and his stated goal
    of using the Guidelines as a “check”. He also erred in dividing the result by
    five when the payout involved six payments payable in six calendar years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In oral submissions, the panel also raised with counsel the
    propriety of dividing the unequalized value of the pension in half when
    assessing the husband’s means available for spousal support.<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[18]</span></span></span></a> In my view, this was yet another error in principle. As husband’s counsel indicated
    before the motion judge – this was not a re-do of the property settlement. It
    was a change motion addressing spousal support following several material
    changes in circumstances: a change in the number of children entitled to
    support; an early pension pay-out; and an increase in the husband’s income in
    absolute terms when he changed his status to that of a consultant. Dividing the
    value of the pension payout in half is a clear error and cannot be permitted to
    stand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal and set
    aside the motion judge’s order relating to spousal support. </p>
  <h2>(9)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Remedy</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have found that the motion judge’s reasons reveal reversible
    error. Under these circumstances, a new hearing on the issue of the quantum of
    spousal support could be ordered. However, before the motion judge, both
    parties indicated they wished to avoid the expense of the trial of an issue. On
    appeal, the wife requested that this court make a final support award. In the
    circumstances, rather than ordering a new hearing, I would address the issue of
    what spousal support order should be made. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is undisputed that the wife is entitled to continuing support.
    Accordingly, the first question is the husband’s means. A related question is
    how to avoid double recovery in relation to the early pension payout.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As previously noted at footnote 2 of these
    reasons, in </span><em>Boston v. Boston</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 64, the
    Supreme Court observed that “[t]</span>o avoid double recovery [in awarding
    spousal support], the court should, where practicable, focus on that portion of
    the payor's income and assets that have not been part of the equalization or
    division of matrimonial assets. In <em>Boston</em>, such income and assets
    included the portion of the husband’s pension income derived from contributions
    made after the date of separation: see <em>Boston v. Boston</em>, [1999] O.J.
    No. 5655 (G.D.) at para. 6; and <em>Boston v. Boston</em>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 413,
    at paras. 18 and 64.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the parties disagree about which components of the now-known
    commuted value of the husband’s pension should be treated as not having been
    part of the equalization. At a minimum, <em>Boston</em> makes clear that
    increases in pension income attributable to pre-marriage and post-marriage service
    are potentially available for support (i.e., there is no question that they were
    not part of the  equalization).  Further, in this case, the parties’ separation
    agreement made any increase attributable to early retirement potentially available
    for support.  Whether increases attributable to factors such as passage of time
    (there is now less time to accumulate the capital necessary to pay the pension),
    changes in interest rates, a change in the mortality assumption and the
    inclusion of a post-retirement survival benefit should also be treated as
    available for support is less clear.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither party submitted any authorities to address that
    question.  The DSW reports did not opine on the issue. Mr. Norton’s approach assumes
    that increases due to such factors are potentially available for support
    without explanation. Where the court intends to avoid double dipping, the legal
    issues as to how the pension income should be apportioned to accomplish this
    are best left to another case where the issue is more fully addressed by the
    parties and the court below.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless, in all the circumstances, I would rely on Mr.
    Norton’s opinion for the purposes of this case. There is no evidence or
    authority demonstrating that his approach is clearly wrong. Further, as noted, the
    parties’ separation agreement demonstrates an intention to revisit the issue of
    support in the event the husband opted for early retirement. That intention
    supports the conclusion that increases in the husband’s income upon early
    retirement, following equalization of net family property based on a later
    retirement date, should not necessarily be excluded from the monies available
    for support purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not, however, adopt Mr. Norton’s proposed alternative
    approach of deeming Mr. Slongo to be in receipt of a fully-indexed annual
    pension. Section 6 of the Guidelines provides that the starting point for
    determining income for spousal support purposes is the definition of income
    under the Federal Child Support Guidelines. Sections 15 to 20 and Schedule III
    of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, SOR/97-175 prescribe the method for
    determining a spouse’s income. Section 16 specifically says that the sources of
    income set out under the heading “Total income” in the Canada Revenue Agency’s
    T1 General form (line 150 income) are the starting point for determining a
    spouse’s annual income.  There is no provision in either set of Guidelines for
    alternative “notional” approaches.  This makes sense for the purposes of both clarity
    and fairness.  A clear starting point for income values is desirable.  Moreover,
    deeming the husband to have a secure indexed pension when he does not is
    potentially unfair.  Unless the parties consent to Mr. Norton’s proposed
    alternative approach, in my view, the support order should be based on the
    reality of the income stream available to the husband for support purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, to calculate the husband’s income for support
    purposes, I would deduct from his line 150 income for each year 31.78% of the
    pension payout (or eventually of the LIRA payout) he receives in that year. </p>

    factors when a party seeks a change: </span><em>Hickey</em><span lang=EN-US>,

    $350,000 is also not a “cap” and that spousal support can and often will
    increase for income above that ceiling.   Given the lump-sum nature of this
    pension payout, intended to compensate the husband for what would otherwise
    have been smaller annual payments, it seems appropriate here for the wife to
    benefit from the application of the formula to the full amount.</span></p>
