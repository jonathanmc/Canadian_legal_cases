lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant BDO Canada LLP (“BDO”) is a
    national accounting and advisory firm with offices across Canada. The
    respondents Tim Ludwig and Tim Ludwig Professional Corporation (collectively, “Ludwig”)
    are, for the purposes of this action, one and the same. Ludwig was a partner of
    BDO for 22 years until, in 2014, he was called into a meeting and told to
    retire. He brought an action against BDO claiming that BDO breached the terms
    of their partnership agreement. Ludwig was granted summary judgment and awarded
    damages. BDO appeals the findings of liability and the damages awarded. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>Background</span></span></h1>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ludwig is a chartered accountant and a licensed
    trustee in bankruptcy. From 1992 to 2014, through his company, the respondent
    Tim Ludwig Professional Corporation, Ludwig was a partner of BDO and its
    predecessor firms. Ludwig worked in BDO’s insolvency group in Edmonton,
    Alberta.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The “BDO Canada LLP Agreement” (the “Partnership
    Agreement”) set out the terms of the partnership for all partners, including
    Ludwig. The Partnership Agreement was governed by the laws of Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Partnership Agreement provided for the
    timing and the terms of departure for each partner. For Ludwig, his “compulsory
    retirement date”, as set out in Article 15.1, was January 1, 2019. The Partnership
    Agreement also provided a process for the “Requested Resignation” of a partner
    before the compulsory retirement date. Pursuant to Article 17.4, the Policy Board
    – consisting of seven members elected for three-year terms – having determined
    that it was not in the best interest of the partnership for the partner to
    remain, was to give notice to the partner of the decision and the partner was
    deemed to have resigned. Article 17.4 stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>If the Policy Board unanimously determines
    that it is not in the best interest of the Partnership for a particular Partner
    to remain a Partner in the Partnership, the Policy Board shall give notice in
    writing to the affected Partner requesting such Partner to resign and shall
    give notice to that effect to all the Partners and Designated Persons. Upon
    delivery of such notice by the Policy Board, the affected Partner shall be
    deemed to have resigned from the Partnership. The affected Partner shall be
    entitled to receive his/her Entitlement (to the extent applicable) in
    accordance with Article 11 as though s/he was a retired Partner at the date on
    which s/he is deemed to have resigned from the Partnership.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 8, 2014, Ludwig, then age 60, had been
    with BDO for 22 years. He was called into a meeting with two other partners,
    Blair Davidson and Darren Crocker (the “July meeting”). In this meeting,
    Davidson told Ludwig that: </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>He would have to retire.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The CEO (Keith Farlinger) had “the absolute right to require a
    partner to retire and he requires that you retire at the end of this year. This
    is not a negotiation.” </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> The firm was “over partnered” and the decision to require him to
    retire had nothing to do with his performance or conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The decision to require his retirement was between “you or the guy
    with nine kids at home,” which Ludwig thought was a reference to Jordan Day. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The non-competition clause in the Partnership Agreement would be
    invoked against him following his retirement. (This was apparently a reference
    to the restrictive covenant provision applicable to retired or expelled
    partners in Article 19.1 of the Partnership Agreement.)</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>BDO’s legal counsel deposes that, around the
    time of the July meeting, BDO was restructuring its insolvency practice and
    reducing its complement of partners in light of the decrease in insolvency work
    in Edmonton. Ludwig’s departure was requested based on: (i) the Edmonton Office’s
    poor performance; (ii) the economic challenges facing the Edmonton Office and
    the Edmonton economy more generally; and (iii) Ludwig’s underperformance,
    including but not limited to substandard levels of business development
    activities. BDO did not provide Ludwig with any particulars relating to his
    alleged underperformance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following the July meeting, BDO announced Ludwig’s
    retirement to the Edmonton Financial Recovery Services (“FRS”) group within the
    firm. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sometime between July 8 and August 4, 2014, BDO
    invoked Article 17.4 of the Partnership Agreement as a ground to justify
    requiring Ludwig to retire early. Between August and September of 2014, there
    were inconclusive negotiations between the parties concerning possible
    retirement terms for Ludwig. Ludwig made a settlement proposal on September 4,
    2014. He received a response from BDO stating:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In the case that you do not sign the [proposal
    by BDO] by Oct 3 the policy board will respond to you under “17.4 Requested
    Resignation” of the partnership agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 25, 2014, Ludwig’s counsel wrote to
    the CEO indicating that BDO was not following the process set out in the Partnership
    Agreement. Specifically, BDO did not allege any grounds for expulsion
    particular to Ludwig. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 8, 2014, three months after the
    appellant was told that the CEO expected him to retire, the Policy Board
    unanimously voted to request Ludwig to resign under Article 17.4 (the “October
    meeting”). The minutes of the Policy Board’s meeting read as follows, under the
    heading “Request for Partner Resignation”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The CEO noted that the FRS practice had been
    impacted significantly by a decline in the economic market. Changes were
    required to reduce the impact of the decline. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    Policy Board unanimously agreed</span><span lang=EN-US> that it was in the best

    Agreement.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 9, 2014, BDO provided notice of the

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ludwig brought a claim against BDO alleging that
    his expulsion breached the terms of the Partnership Agreement and entitled him
    to damages in contract. He obtained summary judgment on his claim pursuant to
    r. 20 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge granted summary judgment for two overarching reasons:</p>

    the Partnership Agreement; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:
200%'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Common law principles governing partnerships require that a partner’s
    expulsion must be reasonable and made in good faith, rather than arbitrary or
    capricious. BDO did not advance any evidence that the Policy Board
    independently decided that to expel Ludwig was in the best interest of the
    partnership, and it did not act in good faith because it did not give Ludwig an
    opportunity to explain why he should not be expelled.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge then awarded Ludwig both expectation and aggravated
    damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In granting summary judgment, the motion judge interpreted Article 17.4
    as requiring the Policy Board to make a “determination” that Ludwig’s
    retirement was in the best interest of the firm. He concluded that this did not
    happen because: (i) Ludwig was told at the July meeting that the CEO required
    his retirement and had an absolute right to demand it; (ii) Ludwig was told
    that the July meeting was not a negotiation; (iii) there was no evidence that
    the Policy Board undertook any deliberations prior to the October meeting – it
    merely formalized the CEO’s prior decision; and (iv) BDO invoked Article 17.4
    after Ludwig’s refusal to accept the prior decision of the CEO to expel him,
    indicating that the Policy Board simply rubber stamped the prior decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although, in the motion judge’s view, this disposed of the case, he went
    on to consider common law principles applicable to partnerships. In doing so,
    he rejected BDO’s submission that the Policy Board could rely on a subjective
    standard of assessment to require Ludwig to retire under Article 17.4.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on <em>Blisset v. Daniel</em> (1853), 68 E.R. 1022 (Eng. Ch.), the
    motion judge concluded that the Partnership Agreement should be construed
    strictly against partners exercising a power of expulsion, and if cause for the
    expulsion is not claimed or proven, the exercise of the power to expel must be
    made in good faith. He noted that in <em>Lindley &amp; Banks on Partnership</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> the text states that although “it is
    theoretically possible to frame a ground of expulsion which requires a degree
    of subjective judgment by the other partners … this is not generally to be
    commended,” and courts will “almost inevitably scrutinise the ground relied on
    and may conclude that the partners are obliged to take a ‘reasonable’ view of
    the expelled partner’s conduct”: Roderick I’Anson Banks, <em>Lindley &amp;
    Banks on Partnership</em>, 19th ed. (London: Thomson Reuters, 2010), at para.
    10-120.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, even if Article 17.4 only required a subjective standard of
    assessment by the Policy Board, such a standard still had to be controlled by
    some criteria and required some evidence that would allow a court to inspect
    the propriety of the decision. To recognize a purely subjective standard with
    no supporting evidence would be contrary to the principle that an expulsion
    power must be interpreted strictly. It would allow BDO to have virtually
    unfettered discretion. It would also be contrary to the principle that, in
    making a determination about the best interest of the partnership under Article
    17.4, BDO had to exercise its discretion to expel a partner rationally and in
    good faith, not arbitrarily or capriciously.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ludwig’s expulsion was contrary to Article 17.4 because BDO gave no
    evidence in support of its bald assertions about Ludwig’s performance and that of
    the Edmonton office. A mere vote to confirm a decision that was already made is
    not a “determination” in the sense required by Article 17.4. There was also no
    evidence that the Policy Board made its decision in the best interest of the
    firm, in good faith.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge noted that damages are not generally available as a
    remedy for a wrongfully expelled partner. This principle is articulated in <em>Lindley
    &amp; Banks</em>, at para. 10-131: “since service of an invalid notice of
    expulsion does not affect the recipient’s status as a partner, he cannot claim
    damages against his co-partners for wrongful expulsion”. The motion judge held,
    however, that this was an “extremely formalistic view” and was “unrealistic”
    given the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principle that a wrongful expulsion does not affect a partner’s
    status as a partner is “premised on the assumption that the expelled partner
    can simply resume work at his or her firm and carry on as before”. The motion
    judge held that this assumption does not follow in Ludwig’s case. In
    particular, the motion judge pointed out that Ludwig was 62 years old and
    reaching the end of his career; had been “unceremoniously ejected” from the
    partnership; and his practice had been absorbed by other partners in the firm.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the motion judge awarded Ludwig expectation damages: <em>Western
    Larch Ltd. v. Di Poce Management Ltd.</em>, 2013 ONCA 722, 117 O.R. (3d) 561,
    at para. 73, leave to appeal refused, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 32. He stated that it
    was not open to Ludwig to mitigate his losses as a result of his expulsion
    because he was told that the non-competition clause in Article 19.1 of the Partnership
    Agreement would be invoked against him, preventing him from seeking alternative
    work and making a living in his profession. Thus, Ludwig’s lack of mitigation
    did not reduce the quantum of damages. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that Ludwig was entitled to $1,233,739 in
    damages for loss of profits under BDO’s profit-sharing agreement, which he
    would have received if he had worked to his compulsory retirement date (January
    1, 2019). He was also entitled to receive $61,198, reflecting the additional
    retirement benefit that he would have received if he retired on that date.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also awarded $100,000 in aggravated damages for the harm
    to Ludwig’s reputation that his expulsion caused. The motion judge relied on <em>Plester
    v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co</em>. (2006), 213 O.A.C. 241 (C.A.), leave to
    appeal refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 315, for the principle that aggravated
    damages are appropriate where the defendant’s reckless or intentional conduct
    causes the plaintiff intangible harm. In particular, the motion judge noted
    that the manner in which Ludwig was expelled, which included being told his
    expulsion was non-negotiable, that Article 19.1 (the non-competition clause) applied,
    and BDO’s unilateral announcement of Ludwig’s retirement to the firm, warranted
    an award of aggravated damages. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span

    standard of review applies to the motion judge’s interpretation of the Partnership
    Agreement and to his decision on the applicable measure of damages. The errors
    BDO alleges are errors of law, not findings of fact. As the motion judge
    indicated, “The facts of this case are straightforward and, for the most part,
    not in dispute.” The motion judge was not called upon to consider a factual
    matrix. Nor was there any evidence of negotiations between the parties at the

    common law of partnerships, rather than solely on general principles of contractual
    interpretation. I do not agree with this submission. In my view, s. 45 of the <em>Partnerships
    Act </em>imports the common law rules into the analysis of a partnership
    agreement, except to the extent they have been varied by the agreement or the <em>Act</em>.
    The relevant common law principles, which inform the construction of a
    partnership agreement, are explained in <em>Lindley &amp; Banks</em> as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    an expulsion from a partnership is expropriatory in nature, depriving the
    partner of future profits, an expulsion provision in a partnership agreement
    will be construed strictly: para. 10-123.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Partners
    are fiduciaries <em><span style='font-style:normal'>among themselves</span> </em>and
    the utmost good faith is owed from every member of a partnership towards every
    other member: para. 16-01.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    a discretion is conferred on the management of the firm or on a majority of
    partners, a partner will normally be entitled to expect that it will be
    exercised rationally and in good faith and not arbitrarily or capriciously: at
    para. 16-09.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court considered the interplay between the <em>Partnerships Act</em> and the common law in <em>Rochwerg v. Truster</em> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 687
    (C.A.). <em>Rochwerg</em> involved a partner in an accounting partnership who
    disclosed to his partners that he was a director of a corporate client of the
    firm and remitted his director’s fees to the firm, but did not disclose that he
    was entitled as director to shares and stock options in the company. When he
    left the partnership, an issue arose as to whether he was required to account
    to his partners for his shares and stock options. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cronk J.A. held that both the common law of partnerships and the <em>Partnerships
    Act</em> imposed an obligation on the partner to disclose his shares and options.
    Cronk J.A. wrote, at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It has long been established that partners owe a fiduciary duty
    to each other, and that equitable principles hold fiduciaries to a strict
    standard of conduct, encompassing <span class=Underline>duties of loyalty,
    utmost good faith</span><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:
none'> </span></span>and avoidance of conflict of duty and self-interest. These
    are well recognized, core principles of the law of partnership. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, at paras. 62-63:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The fiduciary duty between partners thus arises not only from
    the reciprocal agency relationship between them but, also, from the duty of utmost
    good faith which each partner owes to the other. Fundamental to this
    overarching fiduciary duty is the requirement that each partner place the
    interests of the partnership, and the avoidance of situations which create, or
    could create, a conflict between fiduciary duty and the interests of the
    partnership, ahead of a partner's private interests. Accordingly, partners are
    required to prefer the interests of the partnership over their own personal
    interests. The scope of the fiduciary duty in partnerships is of the broadest
    nature. As stated by Vice-Chancellor Bacon in <em>Helmore v. Smith (No. 1)</em> (at p. 444):</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>[I]f fiduciary relation means anything I cannot conceive a
    stronger case of fiduciary relation than that which exists between partners.
    Their mutual confidence is the life blood of the concern. It is because they
    trust one another that they are partners in the first instance; it is because
    they continue to trust each other that the business goes on.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mutual trust, confidence and good faith are the cornerstones of
    the modern professional services partnership. Without them, the very essence of
    the partnership arrangement is eroded and, ultimately, destroyed. In my view,
    the equitable principles developed over the last century concerning the
    fiduciary obligations of partners continue to control contemporary
    partnerships. They may require, however, flexible application to respond to
    changing partnership structures, activities and settings. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, partners owe each other a duty of utmost good faith at
    common law and the traditional rules governing partnerships discussed in <em>Lindley
    &amp; Banks</em> continue to apply in Ontario: see <em>DiPoce v. DeCicco</em>,
    2013 ONSC 6409, [2013] O.J. No. 4741, at para. 18; and <em>Springer v. Aird
    &amp; Berlis LLP</em> (2009), 96 O.R. (3d) 325 (S.C.), at paras. 167-168,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, Article 17.4 of the Partnership Agreement must be
    interpreted in light of the partners’ duty of utmost good faith towards each
    other. The expropriatory nature of expulsion and the loss of profits that it
    entails requires that the provision be construed strictly in favour of the
    expelled partner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to consider whether BDO breached Article 17.4.</p>

lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The wording of Article 17.4 is consistent with the intent of
    the common law with respect to the expectation of good faith on the part of the
    partners and strict construction of an expulsion clause.  The wording of
    Article 17.4 authorizes the Policy Board to request a partner’s resignation if it<em> </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>“</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, </span>to trigger Article 17.4, there
    must be some evidence put before and considered by the Policy Board that shows
    it was reasonable for the Policy Board to conclude that it is not in the
    partnership’s best interest for a particular partner to remain. The point of
    the obligation to consider some evidence that provides a basis in fact for a
    partner’s expulsion under Article 17.4 is to ensure that the Policy Board’s
    decision is made in good faith in the partnership’s best interest and does not
    arbitrarily or capriciously expropriate the expelled partner’s profits. This
    approach is consistent with the case law the motion judge referenced, namely
    the decision of the Court of Exchequer in <em>Wood v. Woad</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (1873)</span></em>, L.R. 9 Ex. 190 (Eng. Exch.), as
    described by Lord Jessel in <em>Russell v. Russell</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (1880)</span></em>, 14 Ch. D. 471 (Eng. Ch. Div.),
    at p. 479. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To say that the Policy Board’s expulsion decision under Article 17.4
    should be reasonably based on some evidence, rather than arbitrary or
    capricious, is not to interpret the provision without regard to its purpose of
    providing a lower standard for expulsion as compared to Article 17.1. Article
    17.1 sets out a list of specific grounds justifying a partner’s expulsion (for
    example, if a partner’s conduct is likely to damage the partnership, or if a
    partner is convicted of a criminal offence).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obligation to provide evidence is to ensure that the Policy Board’s decision
    is reasonably referable to the best interest requirement stipulated in Article
    17.4 and imported by the common law duty of good faith. It is not an obligation
    to consider <span class=Underline>some particular ground</span> that would make
    it in the best interest of the partnership for a partner to not remain with it.
    A more onerous requirement of this kind is imposed by Article 17.1’s
    enumerated, pre-designated grounds of misconduct. The focus under Article 17.4
    is <span class=Underline>not on the nature, substance or merits of a ground</span> on which the Policy Board relies to request a partner’s retirement; it is
    whether <span class=Underline>there was a ground</span> that, on the record,
    could reasonably justify a partner’s expulsion in the partnership’s best
    interest. This is what the language of Article 17.4 requires. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Policy Board’s reasons, as reflected in the minutes of the October meeting,
    relate to the economic climate in Edmonton and the firm’s economic
    circumstances. In the July meeting, Ludwig was told that his underperformance
    was also a factor. I agree with the motion judge that these were bald
    assertions. It is significant that neither the CEO nor any member of the Policy
    Board gave evidence on the summary judgment motion. There was no evidentiary
    basis on which to reasonably conclude that it was in the best interest of the
    partnership to request Ludwig’s retirement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, it is clear from the evidence that the decision to expel Ludwig
    was not made by the Policy Board, as required by Article 17.4. It was made by
    the CEO. Ludwig was informed of such in the July meeting when he was told: (i)
    the CEO required his retirement; (ii) the CEO had the absolute right to demand Ludwig’s
    resignation; and (iii) this was not a negotiation. This uncontradicted evidence
    supports the inference that the Policy Board’s decision in October was
    pre-determined. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The language of Article 17.4 requires the Policy Board to “determine” the
    best interest of the partnership. There is no evidence that it did so. The
    motion judge, at para. 52, stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A]s BDO’s written argument acknowledges, “this decision [to
    reduce the number of partners in the Edmonton] (sic) <span class=Underline>was
    made</span> by BDO and, after negotiations with the Plaintiffs failed, was <span
class=Underline>ultimately carried out</span> by the Policy Board” etc. This
    assertion serves to confirm that the Policy Board, in its meeting on 8 October,
    merely formalised a decision that had been made previously and by someone other
    than the Policy Board itself. There is no evidence as to what deliberations, if
    any, the Policy Board undertook at, or in advance of the 8 October meeting.
    [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, I conclude that the motion judge was correct in his
    interpretation of Article 17.4 and did not err in holding that BDO did not
    comply with the provision in purporting to expel Ludwig from the partnership.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge noted that although damages are generally not available
    to a partner who has been wrongfully expelled, in this case reinstatement was
    “unrealistic”. He therefore awarded damages on an expectation basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BDO submits that the motion judge erred in awarding damages that reflect
    the profits that Ludwig would have received had the contract not been breached.
    The motion judge acknowledged that Ludwig could have been expelled without
    cause had BDO properly followed the directives of Article 17.4. In other words,
    the Policy Board could have forced Ludwig out if it acted in good faith and relied
    on sufficient evidence in making an independent determination that it was in
    the best interest of the partnership for Ludwig to retire. BDO argues that, in
    terms of damages, Ludwig was only entitled to be put in the position he would
    have been in had the contract been performed. That is, if the Policy Board had properly
    executed its power to expel him from the partnership.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BDO also alleges that the motion judge erred by failing to reduce Ludwig’s
    damages for failing to mitigate. Although Article 19.1 is a non-competition
    clause, BDO submits that the clause was limited to a 40 kilometre radius from
    the Edmonton office and expired two years from the date of Ludwig’s expulsion.
    In any event, BDO argues, there were other options available to Ludwig to
    mitigate his losses. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These submissions by BDO were made for the first time on appeal without
    supporting evidence. Before the motion judge, BDO did not contest Ludwig’s
    analysis with respect to damages, and there was no evidence before the motion
    judge to contradict any element of Ludwig’s claim for damages. Neither party
    raised the issue of mitigation in the proceedings below. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary obligation on a summary judgment motion is well

    distinguished contract damages for intangible harm from damages for intangible
    harm arising out of circumstances that aggravate the breach of contract,
    referring to the latter as “true aggravated damages”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[These damages] are not awarded under the
    general principle of </span><em>Hadley v. Baxendale</em><span lang=EN-US>, but
    rest on a separate cause of action — usually in tort — like defamation,
    oppression or fraud. The idea that damages for mental distress for breach of
    contract may be awarded where an object of a contract was to secure a
    particular psychological benefit has no effect on the availability of such
    damages. If a plaintiff can establish mental distress as a result of the breach
    of an independent cause of action, then he or she may be able to recover
    accordingly. The award of damages in such a case arises from the separate cause
    of action. It does not arise out of the contractual breach itself, and it has
    nothing to do with contractual damages under the rule in </span><em>Hadley v.
    Baxendale.</em></p>

lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the employment context, damages for intangible
    harm arising out of the manner of termination may be awarded pursuant to the <em>Hadley
    v. Baxendale</em> principle. In <em>Keays v. Honda Canada Inc.</em>, 2008 SCC
    39, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 362, the Supreme Court confirmed the rule established in <em>Wallace
    v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</em>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701, that employers owe an
    obligation of good faith and fair dealing in the manner of dismissing an
    employee, such that an employment contract creates an expectation that the
    employer will be “candid, reasonable, honest and forthright with its employees”: </span><em>Keays</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 58. Breach of this obligation
    therefore gives rise to damages for intangible harm, which is reasonably
    foreseeable and in the contemplation of the parties as a consequence of the
    breach. In <em>Keays</em> the Supreme Court stated, at para. 58:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Fidler</em><span lang=EN-US> provides that “as long as the
    promise in relation to state of mind is a part of the bargain in the reasonable
    contemplation of the contracting parties, mental distress damages arising from
    its breach are recoverable”. In </span><em>Wallace</em><span lang=EN-US>, the
    Court held employers “to an obligation of good faith and fair dealing in the
    manner of dismissal” and created the expectation that, in the course of
    dismissal, employers would be “candid, reasonable, honest and forthright with
    their employees”. At least since that time, then, there has been expectation by
    both parties to the contract that employers will act in good faith in the
    manner of dismissal. Failure to do so can lead to foreseeable, compensable
    damages. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>

    of dismissal of employment are therefore not awarded for an independently
    actionable wrong and are not “true aggravated damages”, as defined in <em>Fidler</em>.
    They arise from the breach of the employment contract – specifically, the employer’s
    implied contractual obligation to act in good faith when dismissing an
    employee. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The decision in <em>Keays</em> overturned that
    in <em>Vorvis v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R.
    1085, in which the court held that damages for intangible harm in the
    employment context were only available if the employer committed an
    independently actionable wrong. </span><em>Keays</em><span lang=EN-US> also
    overturned the proposition established in <em>Wallace</em> that bad faith in
    the manner of dismissal entitles the employee to an increase in damages in lieu
    of proper notice of termination. As the court wrote in <em>Keays</em>, at para.
    59:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[T]here is no reason to retain the distinction
    between “true aggravated damages” resulting from a separate cause of action and
    moral damages resulting from conduct in the manner of termination. Damages
    attributable to conduct in the manner of dismissal are always to be awarded
    under the </span><em>Hadley</em><span lang=EN-US> principle. Moreover, in cases
    where damages are awarded, no extension of the notice period is to be used to
    determine the proper amount to be paid. The amount is to be fixed according to
    the same principles and in the same way as in all other cases dealing with
    moral damages. Thus, if the employee can prove that the manner of dismissal
    caused mental distress that was in the contemplation of the parties, those
    damages will be awarded not through an arbitrary extension of the notice
    period, but through an award that reflects the actual damages.</span></p>

    when directly applying the rules governing intangible damages in the employment
    context to partners. Courts have held that partners are typically not employees
    and are governed by a separate legal regime at common law and have specialized
    legislation, particularly the <em>Partnerships Act</em>: see <em>SMI Sales Inc.
    v. Ontario (Minister of Finance)</em>, 2007 ONCA 451, 226 O.A.C. 169; <em>Weibe

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>However, </span>the reasoning of the court in <em>Keays</em>,
    in combination with the principles of partnerships law discussed above,
    suggests that damages for intangible harm are available in the partnerships
    context on the <em>Hadley v. Baxendale</em> principle where the harm was in the
    reasonable contemplation of the parties when they made their contract. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Keays</em> holds that, because employers have an implied contractual
    obligation of good faith in the manner of dismissal, damages for bad faith in the
    manner of dismissal are within the contemplation of the parties when they enter
    into the contract. Given the duty of utmost good faith owed between partners,
    confirmed in <em>Rochwerg</em>, the reasoning in <em>Keays</em> should apply in
    the partnerships context: damages flowing from bad faith in the manner of a
    partner’s expulsion are within the reasonable contemplation of the parties when
    they enter into the partnership agreement. Such damages can be awarded on the <em>Hadley
    v. Baxendale</em> principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, part of what the parties agree to when they enter into
    the partnership agreement is that they must treat each other with utmost good
    faith. The intangible harm resulting from a bad faith expulsion is reasonably
    foreseeable and flows from the breach of the duty of good faith, which is an
    implied term of the partnership agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge awarded aggravated damages on the basis of BDO’s
    conduct and the humiliation it caused. He said, at para. 93:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he circumstances of Mr. Ludwig’s removal, including the
    “negotiation” that was not, in fact, a negotiation (at least&nbsp;<em>vis-à-vis</em>&nbsp;the
    fundamental issue of the termination of Mr. Ludwig’s partnership), the unilateral
    announcement of his “retirement” by BDO, his subsequent ejection (“deemed”
    resignation) from the partnership and BDO’s invocation of the non-competition
    clause in the Partnership Agreement, warrant an award of aggravated damages
    reflecting the embarrassment and reputational harm which he experienced. I fix
    those damages at $100,000.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
