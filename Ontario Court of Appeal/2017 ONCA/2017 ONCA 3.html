  <p class=Heard>Heard: November 23, 2016</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered and the sentence
    imposed by Justice Guy P. Di Tomaso of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    with a jury, on June 2, 2010.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Pardu J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two groups of young males, some fueled by alcohol, traded insults at an
    apartment building on Strabane Avenue in Barrie, Ontario. One group was on the
    front lawn of the apartment building; the other was inside an apartment.
    Tensions escalated between the two groups throughout the morning of June 16,
    2007. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Joseph Nicholson, came to the apartment after he received
    a call from the occupants. He entered the apartment through the back door and soon
    stormed out of the building to confront the other group, followed by three
    others. Two members of the outside group, Jeremy Rodgers and Joseph Tanner, were
    stabbed in the altercation. Mr. Rodgers survived but Mr. Tanner died from his
    injuries. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the stabbings, the appellant and his associates went back into the
    apartment and left the apartment building through the back door. Upon leaving
    the premises, the appellant dropped a knife in a sewer. The four young men eventually
    took a cab to the appellant’s apartment where they changed their clothing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on a statement he made to the police, the appellant’s position
    at trial was that he stabbed Rogers in self-defence and denied that he stabbed
    Tanner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A jury convicted the appellant of attempted murder of Mr. Rodgers and
    first degree murder of Mr. Tanner.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issues</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from conviction on four grounds:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    erred in his instructions on the appellant’s after-the-fact conduct, consisting
    of flight, disposal of evidence and change of clothing.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge’s relation of evidence to the jury relevant to planning and deliberation
    was heavily weighted in favour of inculpatory evidence and made scant reference
    to evidence suggesting an absence of planning and deliberation. The trial
    judge’s charge to the jury also included evidence that was irrelevant to the issue
    of planning and deliberation, and was inconsistent with the trial judge’s
    earlier rulings refusing to leave party liability on the murder or manslaughter
    of Mr. Tanner to the jury.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge’s jury instructions on the intent required for murder were insufficient.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    erred in refusing to redact references to the appellant being bipolar from
    statements admitted at trial. The appellant submits that this stigmatized him
    in the eyes of the jury. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After-the-fact conduct</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The after-the-fact conduct in issue in this case consisted of the
    appellant’s flight from the scene, disposal of evidence, and change of clothing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant acknowledges that after-the-fact conduct can be relevant
    to the assessment of an accused’s claim of self-defence: <em>R. v. Rodgerson</em>,
    2014 ONCA 366, [2014] O.J. No. 2232, at para. 53, aff’d 2015 SCC 38, [2015] 2
    S.C.R. 760, at para. 27; <em>R. v. Peavoy</em> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 620, at p.
    631-32 (C.A.).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both trial counsel and the trial judge agreed that evidence of the
    appellant’s after-the-fact conduct was irrelevant to the murder charge, but
    could be left to the jury in assessing the claim of self-defence in relation to
    the attempted murder charge. The trial judge explicitly told the jury that this
    evidence “relates only to Mr.&nbsp;Nicholson’s claim of self-defence regarding
    Jeremy Rodgers and cannot be used in determining the criminal culpability of
    Mr. Nicholson regarding Joey Tanner.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as the trial judge proceeded to charge the jury on the issue of
    self-defence and the relevance of the after-the-fact conduct on the attempted
    murder charge, the trial judge continually referred to the “<span
class=Underline>offence</span><span class=Underline>s</span> charged”. For
    example, the trial judge charged the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>On the other hand, if you find that Joseph Nicholson actually
    did or said what he is alleged to have done or said after the offences were
    committed, you must consider next whether this was because Joseph Nicholson was
    conscious of having committed the <span class=Underline>offences</span> charged
    or for some other reason.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If you find that Joseph Nicholson
    actually did or said what he is alleged to have done or said after the <span
class=Underline>offences</span> were committed, you must be careful not to
    immediately conclude that he did or said so because he was conscious of having
    committed the <span class=Underline>offences</span> charged.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that use of the plural “offences” undermined the
    trial judge’s express instructions that the evidence of the appellant’s
    after-the-fact conduct was relevant only to the attempted murder charge and
    invited the jury to consider the after-the-fact evidence in relation to both
    offences charged.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with that submission. In my view, the jury would not have
    disregarded the trial judge’s express instructions that the after-the-fact
    conduct could only be used in determining the appellant’s criminal culpability
    with respect to the attempted murder offence because the trial judge used the
    plural “offences” in the part of the charge dealing with the claim of
    self-defence on the attempted murder charge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge instructed the jury on the included offence of
    aggravated assault for the attempted murder charge, although this was not an
    included offence on the language of the indictment. The use of the plural
    “offences” could reasonably refer to both the attempted murder and the
    aggravated assault which the trial judge treated as an included offence.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the after-the-fact conduct had no
    probative value in the particular circumstances of this case. In his statement
    to police, the appellant ultimately suggested that he might have gone too far
    in defending himself. Since he admitted to some moral culpability, the
    appellant argues that evidence of his conduct following the offence does not shed
    light on whether he acted in legitimate self-defence. He submits that the
    after-the-fact conduct does not make the claim of self-defence more or less
    credible. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. As indicated in <em>Rodgerson</em>, at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Post-offence conduct need not point
    to only one reasonable inference to be relevant and admissible to prove a fact
    in issue. If the inference urged by the Crown is reasonably available, the
    post-offence conduct will be left with the jury, who, after considering any
    competing inferences available, will determine what effect, if any, should be
    given to the post-offence conduct evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The inferences sought by the Crown from the flight, disposal of the
    knife, and change of clothing were reasonably available to the jury, although
    other inferences were possible. The trial judge did caution the jury that there
    might be other explanations for the after-the-fact conduct. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jury charge on planning and deliberation</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided legal instructions in relation to the planned
    and deliberate elements of the offence of first degree murder. He then related
    some of the evidence to planning and deliberation to the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=StrongUnderline style='page-break-after:avoid'>PLANNING</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The purpose of Mr. Nicholson’s attendance at 67 Strabane Avenue
    was related to the presence of Chris Hutton and company. He had received calls
    from Massey and Deschamps to come to 67 Strabane to make sure nothing happened.
    There were problems at the apartment building. Mr.&nbsp;Nicholson said he would
    try to find a way to get there. According to Deschamps it was left open-ended. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Nicholson took a cab instead of waiting for the next city bus
    at the bus terminal to make his way to 67 Strabane.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Nicholson had the cab drop him off at the back of 67 Strabane
    concealing his arrival. He went into the back of the building through the back
    door and made his way directly to apartment #1.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon entering apartment #1, Mr. Nicholson put his bag down. There
    was little, if any, conversation. Mr.&nbsp;Nicholson said words to the effect
    “let’s go” or “let’s go deal with this”. Mr. Nicholson was first to go out the
    front door with Mr. Massey, Gibbs and Deschamps following behind.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior to reaching the front door, Nicholson removed his shirt. </p>

    regard.</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did Mr. Nicholson’s plan involve not only his own physical

  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span

    discussion suggest any prior development of a plan and knowledge of an
    intention to confront his victims along with Massey, Deschamps and Gibbs?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did Nicholson’s manner of escape suggest a predetermined thought

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Many of these elements are equally consistent with a plan to confront
    and assault the members of the other group, as opposed to a plan to commit
    murder. The facts identified by the trial judge and the manner in which the
    list was organized eclipsed this distinction. For example, the fact that the
    appellant removed his shirt before reaching the front door may be probative of
    a plan to fight rather than to murder. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, some of the evidence identified by the trial judge was irrelevant
    to the issues of planning and deliberation. For example: “Was the manner in
    which Joey Tanner quickly stabbed and disabled, suggest an intent to kill
    [sic]”. To get to the issues of planning and deliberation, the jury would have
    already concluded that the accused intended to kill the victim. This question
    blurs the distinction between the intent to kill, and planning and
    deliberation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This list was also heavily weighted towards evidence supporting the Crown’s
    case. Significant parts of the evidence supporting the defence were not
    included in the trial judge’s summary of the evidence on planning and
    deliberation, including, notably, the accused’s own statement to police given
    within 24 hours of the stabbing, which the Crown placed into evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his statement to police, the appellant told police that he did not
    know the members of the other group. He said he had no special relationship
    with the individuals in the house and that he only knew one of them. He brought
    beer to the house, and went there in part to visit. He also went there to help
    the individuals who were in the apartment deal with the group that was outside,
    kicking the window of the apartment. Members of the inside group had called the
    appellant that morning and asked for help. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also told the police that when he left the house to
    confront the other group, he ran out of the door, “pumped,” ready to fight. He
    may have said, “let’s go and take care of them”, to get the other group away
    from the apartment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He told police that he hit the guy who came after him. He said he was
    protecting himself but that “maybe I did it a little bit too much.” He said that
    he and the others who were in the house “never had no big plans” when they
    embarked on the fight with the other group of young men. He had been drinking. He
    agreed that he had a temper and that rage might have taken over before his
    brain kicked in. He said he was bipolar and had been trying to get medication
    for four years, and that as a result he “snapped”. He said the situation
    “totally escalated way out of control” and was “pretty quick.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, these stabbings took place in broad daylight, on a residential
    street with many witnesses. The fact that the appellant carried a knife would
    not suggest planning and deliberation if it was his usual habit to carry one. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not relate any of the foregoing evidence, relevant to
    the issues of planning and deliberation, to the jury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel did not object to the charge, and the charge was the
    result of consultation with counsel. This is not determinative, however, where
    the charge is so one-sided that it amounts to unfairness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown acknowledges that this was a weak case of first degree murder,
    and asks that this court substitute a verdict of guilty of second degree murder
    if we accept the appellant’s arguments that the charge on planning and
    deliberation was flawed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I would give effect to this ground, I need not address the other
    arguments made in relation to first degree murder.  </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instructions on intent to kill</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, the appellant did not pursue the position advanced in his
    factum that the instruction on the intent to commit murder was also unfair. Those
    instructions focused on the circumstances immediately surrounding the stabbings
    and the parts of the victims’ bodies that were stabbed – close to Mr. Rodgers’ heart
    and three times in Mr. Tanner’s back. I do not accept the argument that the aspect
    of the charge pertaining to the mental state required for murder was unfair in
    the same way as the trial judge’s instructions on planning and deliberation.</p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Refusal to remove references to the appellant being bipolar from
    statements tendered as evidence by the Crown</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s own statement to police and an out-of-court statement by
    a recanting witness, Mr. Gibbs, who was with the appellant in the house prior
    to the altercation, were placed in evidence before the jury. As indicated above,
    the appellant told police that he was bipolar, that he had been trying to get
    medication for four years, and that, as a result, he snapped during the
    confrontation. Mr. Gibbs told the police he was afraid of the appellant, who he
    characterized as “messed up” and “bipolar.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge’s refusal to remove his own
    and Mr. Gibbs’ references to his being “bipolar” could have prejudiced him in
    the eyes of the jury, and that this bad character evidence tended only to show
    that he was the type of person likely to have committed the offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant referred to his own mental condition in explaining why he
    acted as he did in stabbing Mr. Rodgers. This was relevant to the appellant’s
    state of mind at the time of the offence and potentially supportive of his
    claim of self-defence. I am not persuaded that the prejudicial effect of this
    evidence necessarily outweighed its probative value. In any event, these two isolated
    references to the appellant’s being “bipolar” would not have had any impact on
    the outcome, given that the statements were made in the context of a jury trial
    that lasted approximately 13 weeks, the submissions by the Crown made no
    reference to this evidence, and the submissions by the defence and the charge
    to the jury were similarly silent in this respect. The jury would not have
    considered Mr. Gibbs to be a reliable diagnostician of the appellant’s mental
    health. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disposition</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction on all counts,
    but pursuant to s. 686(1)(b)(i) and (3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    substitute a conviction for second degree murder for the conviction for first
    degree murder. The matter is remitted back to the trial judge for sentencing
    pursuant to s. 686(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. </p>
