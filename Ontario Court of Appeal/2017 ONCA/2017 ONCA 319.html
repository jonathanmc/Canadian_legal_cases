  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Elizabeth M.
    Stewart of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 2, 2015, with reasons
    reported at 2015 ONSC 3481, [2015] 3 C.N.L.R. 35.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Sharpe J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>A.       Overview</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on this appeal is whether the appellant, Dr. Lynn Gehl, is
    entitled to be registered as an “Indian”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> under the <em>Indian Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5 (the “Act”). Dr. Gehl’s
    entitlement turns on amendments made in 1985 to bring the Act into compliance
    with s. 15 of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(the “</span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>”)</span></em><em>.</em> Those amendments repealed
    discriminatory provisions in the Act that had deprived several of Dr. Gehl’s
    ancestors of their Indian status, and retrospectively restored their status.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Gehl’s paternal grandmother became a status Indian as a result of
    the 1985 amendments. Dr. Gehl’s father was born in 1935. The identity of his
    father, Dr. Gehl’s paternal grandfather, is unknown. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the 1985 amendments, Dr. Gehl brought an application to
    register as an Indian. The Registrar for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern
    Development Canada (the “Registrar”) denied Dr. Gehl’s application for
    registration on the ground that to qualify for status under the Act, Dr. Gehl
    had to prove that both her paternal grandmother and grandfather had status, and
    she had failed to prove the status of her unknown grandfather.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Gehl, supported by the intervener LEAF, argues that s. 6(1)(f) of
    the Act and the Proof of Paternity Policy (the “Policy”), adopted by the
    Registrar for determining paternity, infringe s. 15 of the <em>Charter </em>by
    discriminating against her and other descendants of illegitimate children of
    aboriginal women on grounds of sex. As I will explain, stripped to its
    essentials, Dr. Gehl’s argument is that, on the basis of the evidence she
    presented, she is entitled to status.</p>
  <p class=Heading>B.      Indian Status and the 1985 Amendments to the <em>Indian
    Act</em> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Entitlement to Indian status is determined by the Act. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before 1951, the Act provided that registration was to be done by Indian
    agents and other local officials. Section 29 of the <em>Indian Act</em>, S.C.
    1951, c. 29, created a centralized Indian Registry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to 1985, entitlement to register as an Indian was transmitted
    solely through the male line. The child of an Indian man was entitled to
    registration, even if the mother of the child was non-Indian. A non-Indian
    woman who married an Indian man was also entitled to register. Conversely,
    Indian women lost their Indian status upon marrying a non-Indian man, and the
    children of an Indian woman and a non-Indian man were not entitled to register. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only exception to the patrilineal rule was in relation to
    illegitimate children. Although the exact procedures differed over time, the
    pre-1985 <em>Indian Act </em>contained what amounted to a rebuttable
    presumption that the illegitimate children of Indian women were fathered by
    Indian men, and that therefore these children were entitled to register as
    Indians. Conversely, Indian fathers could pass on status to their illegitimate sons,
    but not to their illegitimate daughters: see <em>Martin v. Chapman</em>, [1983]
    1 S.C.R. 365. In <em>Descheneaux c. Canada (Procureur général),</em> 2015 QCCS
    3555, [2016] 2 C.N.L.R. 175, the Quebec Superior Court held that the denial of
    status to an illegitimate daughter born to an Indian father before 1985 was
    contrary to s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was widespread dissatisfaction with the pre-1985 statutory regime
    for determining Indian status. Many within the aboriginal community considered
    the rules to be at odds with First Nations traditions. Although a majority of
    the Supreme Court held in <em>A.G. Canada v. Lavell</em>, [1974] S.C.R. 1349,
    that depriving an Indian woman of her status upon marriage to a non-Indian man
    did not violate the guarantee of equality in the <em>Canadian Bill of Rights</em>,
    S.C. 1960, c. 44, that decision was widely criticized and it became apparent
    that a major overhaul was required in light of the <em>Charter.</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In 1985, Parliament amended the Act<em> </em>with a view to
    making it compliant with the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>’s</span></em><i> </i>s. 15 guarantee of equality. These amendments followed extensive
    consultation with relevant stakeholders. The amendments sought to balance the
    claims of equality-seeking groups with the need to respect the autonomy of
    First Nations and their control over band membership, as well as the potential
    impact on communities and resources resulting from adding large numbers of new
    registrants. I attach as Appendix A the relevant provisions from the
    legislation, present and past.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>When introducing the amendments, David Crombie, then
    Minister for Indian Affairs, stated that the amendments sought to achieve and
    balance the following objectives (<em>House of Commons Debates</em>, 33rd
    Parl., 1st Sess., March 1, 1985, at p. 2645): </p>
  <p class=CQuote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to end
    discrimination against women created by their loss of entitlement to
    registration through marriage to non-Indians;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to restore
    entitlement to registration to those who had lost it due to this
    discrimination, including restoring membership in a band;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to ensure that
    no one should gain or lose entitlement to registration due to marriage; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to ensure that
    anyone who had acquired status under the registration scheme prior to the 1985
    amendments would not lose it; and,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to provide the
    First Nations that desired the ability to determine their own membership with a
    statutory mechanism to do so on a going forward basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Provisions in the pre-1985 Act stipulating exclusive patrilineal
    transmission of status were repealed, as were the provisions stipulating that
    Indian women lost status upon marriage to a non-status male. Pursuant to s. 6(1)(c),
    Indian status was retroactively returned to women who had lost their status
    after marrying non-Indian men. Under s. 6(1)(a), those who had Indian status in
    1985 were entitled to maintain this status even if they would not otherwise
    have status under the new regime. For example, the status of a non-Indian woman
    who had gained the right to register by marrying an Indian man was protected.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 1985 amendments also established a new two-tier system of
    registration. Children with two Indian parents now receive s. 6(1)(f) or “full”
    status, whereas a child with only one Indian parent receives s. 6(2) or
    “partial” status. Those with full status can pass on Indian status to their own
    children, regardless of the Indian status of the other parent. In contrast,
    those with partial status can pass on Indian status to their own child only if
    the other parent also has Indian status (whether full or partial). This is
    known as the “two-parent rule”, and creates what is known as the “second generation
    cut-off”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 1985 amendments also removed all reference to illegitimacy. The
    rules apply equally to all children, whether or not their parents are married.
    The presumption of Indian paternity in favour of illegitimate children born to
    Indian women was repealed. To maintain the two-parent rule, the second
    generation cut-off and the distinction between full and partial status, the
    status of both parents must be determined by the Registrar when deciding the
    status of the child.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further amendments were introduced in 2010 in response to the
    decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <em>McIvor v. Canada
    (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs)</em>, 2009 BCCA 153, 91 B.C.L.R.
    (4th) 1. In that case, aspects of the old legislation favouring male parentage
    and disfavouring female parentage were found to have been carried forward in
    the 1985 amendments, and s. 6(1)(a) and s. 6(1)(c) were struck down. A
    temporary suspension of the declaration of invalidity afforded Parliament the
    opportunity to amend the Act. The amendment, adding s. 6(1)(c.1), was made in
    the <em>Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act</em>, S.C. 2010, c. 18.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Act provides, in s. 14.2 that the Registrar is to determine
    eligibility for registration. The office of the Registrar investigates the applicant’s
    ancestry and makes a determination. If registration is refused, the applicant
    can protest the decision, and if the protest is refused, an appeal lies to the provincial
    superior court pursuant to s. 14.3.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the 1985 amendments, the Registrar developed the Policy. The
    Policy, at least as it stood at the time the Registrar considered Dr. Gehl’s
    application and protest, is an internal departmental guide. It is not expressly
    contemplated by the Act and it is not a regulation. At the time of Dr. Gehl’s
    application for registration and protest, the Policy was in draft form and not
    generally available to the public. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Policy sets out five types of evidence of paternity that the
    Registrar will accept, in the following order of preference: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>1) Birth certificates of provincial, territorial or state Vital
    Statistics authorities naming the father; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>2) Court orders declaring paternity; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>3) Statutory declarations, preferably by the mother and father,
    but two close relatives will suffice if they can identify the father from their
    own personal knowledge; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>4) If the father denies paternity, it is preferable if the
    mother works with the Vital Statistics Authorities to find other types of
    acceptable evidence to have the father’s name added to the birth certificate; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>5) Where confidentiality or personal safety is a concern and
    none of the above is available, the Registrar may consider other evidence, such
    as a hearing or DNA testing. </p>
  <p class=Heading>C.      Dr. Gehl’s Family Tree</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In order to understand how the 1985 amendments affect Dr. Gehl’s
    entitlement to register, a review of her family tree is required. I attach a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the 1985 amendments, Dr. Gehl’s status was as follows. When her
    father, Rodney Gagnon, was born out of wedlock in 1935, he had no Indian status
    because his mother, Mary Viola Bernadette Gagne, had no status at the time of
    his birth. The reason Mary Gagne had no status was because her mother, Annie
    Menes, lost her status when she married Joseph Gagnon. Joseph Gagnon lacked
    status because his mother, Angeline Jocko, lacked status at the time of his
    birth because of her marriage to a non-status man whose identity is unknown. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>D.</b>      <b>HISTORY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS </b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Gehl applied for registration in 1994. The Registrar determined that
    s. 6(1)(c) of the 1985 amendments retroactively restored the status Annie Menes
    had lost upon her marriage to Joseph Gagnon. Joseph Gagnon retroactively
    acquired status as the status of his mother, Angeline Jocko, was restored by s.
    6(1)(c). The restoration of Indian status to both of Mary Gagne’s parents
    retroactively provided her with s. 6(1)(f) “full” Indian status. However, in
    the view of the Registrar, as the identity of Rodney Gagnon’s father was
    unknown, he could only claim status through one parent, his mother, and
    accordingly, he only acquired partial status. As Dr. Gehl’s mother had no
    status, the Registrar considered her to be the child of one status Indian parent
    with s. 6(2) or partial status. Accordingly, Dr. Gehl could not satisfy the two-parent
    rule, and had no right to be registered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Gehl protested the Registrar’s decision and then appealed the
    refusal of her protest to the Superior Court. That appeal has been held in
    abeyance following the commencement of this action for <em>Charter </em>relief but
    the appeal remains open. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This claim was originally framed as one for damages, but after it was
    struck out with leave to amend, the claim became one for declaratory relief.
    The action lay dormant for a lengthy period, but as the relevant facts were not
    in dispute, the parties eventually agreed to have the issue resolved by way of a
    motion for summary judgment in 2014.</p>
  <p class=Heading>e.       Motion for summary judgment</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the summary judgment motion, Dr. Gehl asserted that s. 6 of the Act<em> </em>and the Policy infringed s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em> because they
    discriminated against her on the enumerated grounds of race and sex and on the
    analogous grounds of family or marital status. She argued that the mother of a
    child will always be known, but there will frequently be situations where the
    Indian mother of a child either does not know the identity of the father of her
    child, or cannot reveal that identity except at unacceptable personal cost.
    Additionally, Dr. Gehl alleged that s. 6 of the Act<em> </em>and the Policy
    discriminated on grounds of marital status and/or illegitimacy. Dr. Gehl argued
    that she and her father should benefit from the same positive presumption of
    Indian paternity that had existed under the pre-1985 Act in relation to the
    illegitimate children of status Indian mothers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General asserted that the denial of Dr. Gehl’s Indian
    status did not turn on race, gender, family or marital status, or illegitimacy.
    It was the unknowable identity of Dr. Gehl’s paternal grandfather that
    prevented her from proving entitlement to registration, and the Attorney
    General submitted that unknowable paternity was not an analogous ground and
    therefore did not engage <em>Charter </em>considerations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that s. 6 of the Act<em> </em>and the Policy
    treated all applicants the same. An onus is placed on all applicants to
    establish entitlement to registration as an Indian by establishing the Indian
    status of their parents. The motion judge agreed with the Crown that
    “unknowable paternity” was the factor preventing Dr. Gehl from registration as
    an Indian, and that this was not an analogous ground under s. 15. Adopting a
    positive presumption of paternity for the illegitimate children of Indian women
    would contradict the clear statutory requirement that registration be granted
    only to individuals with at least two status Indians as grandparents. The first
    step of the s. 15 test was therefore not met, as the law did not create a
    distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground. However, were
    discrimination to have been found, the motion judge noted that she would not
    consider it to create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotype.
    Based on those findings, the motion judge did not proceed to consider s. 1 of
    the <em>Charter </em>or the issue of remedy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge went on to make several <em>obiter </em>comments about
    the application of the Policy to Dr. Gehl. The motion judge indicated that the
    evidence the Policy allows is distinctly problematic in situations such as Dr.
    Gehl’s, where, through no fault of her own, an applicant has no information
    about her grandfather, and thus cannot prove entitlement to registration. The
    motion judge stated, at para. 90, that “[r]equiring anything more from Gehl
    than her statutory declaration attesting to her lack of any reasonable basis
    for belief that the father of her father would not have been entitled to
    registration may go beyond the requirements of the legislation”. She concluded
    that such a statutory declaration might constitute acceptable evidence to
    satisfy the two-parent requirement of the Act, and would not amount to
    establishing a positive presumption of Indian paternity. This type of evidence
    would be no less probative than the residential and other circumstantial
    details that the Registrar, pursuant to the Policy, already viewed as
    acceptable. In the motion judge’s view, such an approach could prevent
    injustice in cases akin to Dr. Gehl’s while remaining consistent with the
    statutory language, history and objectives of the Act “which must include
    cultural preservation and vitality” (para. 91). </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the motion judge, and to some extent before this court, Dr.
    Gehl’s submissions were presented as a challenge to the constitutional validity
    of s. 6. However, in my view, the essential point is the proposition advanced
    by Ms. Eberts on Dr. Gehl’s behalf and by LEAF, namely, that the Registrar
    should accept evidence of the kind submitted by Dr. Gehl as to the paternity of
    her grandfather as sufficient to establish status. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Gehl also moves for the admission of fresh evidence relating to
    directives issued by the Registrar to deal with the 2010 amendments that followed
    the <em>McIvor </em>case.</p>
  <p class=Heading>g.      Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I will first dispense with two preliminary matters,
    namely the Attorney General’s argument that the challenge to the interpretation
    of s. 6 reflected by the Policy is barred by an earlier court ruling, and Dr.
    Gehl’s application to admit fresh evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong><span lang=EN
style='font-style:normal'>(1)      </span><span lang=EN>Ruling striking out the
    original statement of claim</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General submits that Dr. Gehl’s challenge to the Policy is
    barred by a ruling made by a Superior Court judge on November 8, 2001, striking
    out the statement of claim with leave to amend: [2002] 4 C.N.L.R. 108 (Ont.
    S.C.J.). The original statement of claim sought damages for denial of Dr.
    Gehl’s s. 15 equality rights and a declaration that she is entitled to registration
    under the Act. Various causes of action were asserted, including misfeasance in
    public office. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with the Attorney General’s argument that the 2001
    decision striking the original statement of claim precludes Dr. Gehl from
    challenging application of the Policy to her situation. No mention of the
    Policy was made in the 2001 decision. This matter proceeded to summary judgment
    in 2014 on the basis of an amended statement of claim asking for various forms
    of declaratory relief, including the following:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    s. 6 of the Act “in its application to the plaintiff, is contrary to s. 15 of
    the <em>Charter</em>”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    s. 6 violates the s. 15 rights of applicants for registration “whose ancestors
    were born out of wedlock”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that

    their or their ancestors’ paternity”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    s. 6 of the Act “be interpreted and applied in a manner that does not
    disadvantage individuals or descendants of individuals whose paternity is
    unknown”; and,</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    the plaintiff is entitled to be registered pursuant to s. 6.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the current statement of claim is fundamentally different
    from that struck out in 2001. The claim for damages is gone and the focus is on
    declaratory relief. The amended claim directly puts in issue how an applicant
    is to establish the paternity of an unknown ancestor. I reject the submission
    that Dr. Gehl should be precluded from raising those issues on the basis of the
    2001 order.</p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong><span lang=EN

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Dr. Gehl moves for the admission as fresh evidence
    of directives issued by the Registrar following the 2010 amendments to the Act
    indicating that, in some circumstances, the pre-1985 presumption of paternity
    is applied to persons born before 1985. While this evidence was not known or
    available to Dr. Gehl at the time of the summary judgment motion, I am not
    persuaded that it is relevant to the issues before us. The proposed fresh
    evidence shows that the Registrar applies the pre-1985 presumption of paternity
    to individuals who had status under the pre-1985 Act at the time of their
    birth. That does not assist Dr. Gehl, as Mary Gagne did not have status at the
    time of Rodney Gagnon’s birth, but only acquired status as a result of the 1985
    amendments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[35]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>While her action was framed as a constitutional
    challenge, during the argument of this appeal it became clear that Dr. Gehl
    does not press her challenge to the constitutional validity of s. 6(1)(f) or
    the “two-parent” rule. Dr. Gehl does, however, challenge the adequacy and
    reasonableness of the Policy. Her central submission is that, on the evidence
    she has presented and on a proper application of s. 6(1)(f), it is unreasonable
    to deny her status. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>This argument should have been advanced by way of
    her statutory appeal from the Registrar’s dismissal of Dr. Gehl’s protest
    against the decision denying her status. However, the focus of this action has
    considerably evolved over time and, as it has evolved, it has largely overtaken
    the statutory appeal. The issue has been argued fully before us. In these
    circumstances, it is in the interest of justice for this court to deal with
    that issue, subject to the procedural confines of this appeal. </span>As I have
    already noted, the Policy has no statutory force. It is not a regulation or
    instrument adopted pursuant to any provision of the Act. The version of the
    Policy before us on this appeal, and the version the Registrar considered in
    relation to Dr. Gehl’s case, is marked “DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY”. It
    was not published or available to the public at the time the Registrar dealt
    with Dr. Gehl’s protest. We were advised in oral argument by counsel for the
    Attorney General that the Draft Policy has now been adopted by the Registrar.
    Whatever status it may now have, at the time the Registrar dealt with Dr.
    Gehl’s protest, the Draft Policy is properly characterized as an exercise of
    administrative discretion. It was an informal and internal document, adopted by
    the Registrar to assist departmental officials when making determinations of
    entitlement to registration. It <span lang=EN>was administrative rather than
    legislative in nature: see </span><i><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a basic proposition that “administrative decision-makers must act
    consistently with the values underlying the grant of discretion, including <i>Charter </i>values”: <i>Doré v. Barreau du Québec</i>, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395,
    at para. 24.  The courts accord deference to the administrative
    decision-maker’s exercise of discretion. Provided “the decision-maker has
    properly balanced the <i>Charter</i> value with the statutory objectives, the
    decision will be found to be reasonable”: <i>Doré</i> at para. 58. On the other
    hand, if the decision-maker fails to balance the <i>Charter</i> rights or
    values at issue with the statutory objective in a reasonable manner, the
    decision is vulnerable to review: see <i>Loyola High School v. Quebec (Attorney
    General)</i>, 2015 SCC 12, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 613, at para. 79, and <i>Doré</i> at
    para. 49. <a name=QuickMark></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I now turn to the relevant <i>Charter</i> rights and values that bear
    upon the Policy as it applies to Dr. Gehl. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 15 of the <em>Charter</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Every individual is equal before and under the
    law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law
    without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on
    race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or
    physical disability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that denial of Indian status constitutes denial of
    the benefit of the law. Indian status carries with it an important bundle of
    legal rights. Registration entails access to significant material benefits,
    including some tax exemptions, extended health coverage and financial
    assistance with post-secondary education. There are also very significant
    intangible benefits. Registration represents the right to belong to and be
    recognized as a member of a community, and to participate in its life and
    governance. Registration also includes the right to pass on Indian status to
    one’s children, described by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in<em> McIvor</em>,
    at para. 71, as being “of significant spiritual and cultural value”. In many
    First Nations communities, registration is also tied to band membership and
    rights of participation in band elections. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 15 involves a flexible and contextual two-part inquiry: <em>Quebec
    v. A., </em>2013 SCC 5, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 331. At the first stage,
    the question is whether “on its face or in its impact, the law creates a
    distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground”: <em>Kahkewistahaw
    First Nation v. Taypotat</em>, 2015 SCC 30, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 548, at para. 19.
    At the second stage, the inquiry is “whether the impugned law fails to respond
    to the actual capacities and needs of the members of the group and instead
    imposes burdens or denies benefits in a manner that has the effect of
    reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating their disadvantage”: <em>Taypotat</em>,
    at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the Attorney General that the determination of entitlement
    to registration on the basis of the entitlement of both parents is, on its
    face, a gender-neutral rule. However, I also agree with Dr. Gehl’s submission
    that the Registrar was required to guard against an exercise of discretion that
    results in substantive inequality. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Proof of identity of a parent is, as a matter of biology and common experience,
    more difficult for a mother to establish than a father. There can hardly ever
    be any doubt about maternity, but there may be considerable doubt about
    paternity. Moreover, a woman may have good reason for her reluctance or
    inability to disclose the identity of her child’s father. The child may be the
    product of a relationship the mother is reluctant or unable to disclose. The
    pregnancy may be the result of a relationship with a man the mother is fearful
    of identifying, for example, a relative, or the spouse or partner of a friend
    or family member. The pregnancy may be the product of abuse, rape or incest.
    The mother may have had multiple sexual partners. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Policy imposes a relatively strict burden of proof
    essentially based upon documentary evidence. The Policy provides that where
    confidentiality or personal safety is a concern and documentary proof of
    paternity is not available, the Registrar may consider conducting a hearing and
    considering other evidence. However, the Policy falls well short of what is
    required to address the circumstances that I have just described making proof
    of paternity problematic for many women. This failure perpetuates the long
    history of disadvantage suffered by Indigenous women. As Parliament itself
    recognized in 1985, the historic practice of stripping and denying Indigenous
    women of status represented a significant disadvantage that was inconsistent
    with the <em>Charter’s</em> promise of equality.</p>

    General. Section 11(e) of <em>the Indian Act,</em> S.C. 1951, c. 29, provided

    of paternity upon which Dr. Gehl seeks to rely. It was only by virtue of the
    1985 amendments that Dr. Gehl’s paternal grandmother acquired status. </span>Dr.
    Gehl therefore cannot rely on the presumption of paternity, which was no longer
    available by the time her paternal grandmother gained status. <span lang=EN>If
    Dr. Gehl is to qualify for status, the Attorney General submits, she must do so

    replace the former presumption of paternity with a presumption of

    had Indian status, and there is no evidence that her unknown paternal
    grandfather did not have status. There is evidence that Dr. Gehl’s great
    grandparents lived on the Golden Lake Reserve, as did her grandmother. Dr.
    Gehl’s father’s birth certificate states that he was born on the “Renfrew” or
    Golden Lake reserve. There is evidence that he was accepted by the community
    and that he lived on the reserve for some time after his birth. His godfather
    was a prominent elder from the reserve. There is no evidence that he was ever
    excluded from the Golden Lake community. That evidence is, of course, far from
    conclusive but, as the motion judge suggested, in the absence of any evidence
    to the contrary, it is capable of supporting an inference that Dr. Gehl’s

    born 50 years before the 1985 amendments. He was born in an era when
    illegitimacy carried with it significant social stigma, and when Indigenous
    women suffered from even greater discrimination and disadvantage than they do

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>The imposition of a relatively strict burden of proving
    paternity may well be appropriate to circumstances arising after 1985, when the
    new regime came into force and after the iniquities of the prior regime had
    been eliminated. However, it is unreasonable to apply that same burden to Dr.
    Gehl’s circumstances in relation to a birth that occurred 50 years prior to the
    amendments and to individuals who had been unjustly deprived of status. To
    impose such a burden fails to take into account and reflect both the equality-enhancing
    and the remedial purposes of the 1985 amendments. Those amendments reached back
    in time and restored rights lost over 100 years ago because of the iniquitous
    provisions of the pre-1985 Act. That restorative purpose would be frustrated if
    some allowance were not given for the difficulty in establishing the identity
    of the unknown father of an illegitimate child born over 80 years ago on a
    reserve to an Indigenous woman who herself had been wrongly deprived of status. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, in a proceeding of this nature, a court will not substitute
    its decision for that of an administrative decision-maker, but rather will
    remit the matter back to the administrative decision-maker for further
    consideration. However there is an exception where doing so would be
    “pointless” as there is only one possible outcome in view of the court’s
    decision: <em>Giguère v. Chambre des Notaires du Quebec</em>, 2004 SCC 1,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 3, at para. 66. In my view, this case falls within that
    category. Dr. Gehl presented some evidence from which it could be inferred that
    her paternal grandfather had status. There is no evidence to the contrary. As
    the motion judge suggested, requiring more from Dr. Gehl than the evidence she
    has provided and a statutory declaration that she has no basis for believing
    that her paternal grandfather would not have been entitled to registration goes
    beyond what, on a reasonable interpretation, the Act requires. Accordingly, it
    is appropriate for this court to grant Dr. Gehl a declaration that she is
    entitled to be registered pursuant to s. 6(2) of the Act as the child of one
    parent with full status.    </p>

    a request to the Registrar to have her name included on the Indian Register or on
    a “Band List”. Dr. Gehl applied to be registered on November 28, 1994. Her
    application was denied on February 13, 1995. She protested the decision under
    s. 14.2 of the Act on March 16, 1995. The Registrar responded in a letter dated
    February 4, 1997, advising Dr. Gehl of the intention to uphold the decision,
    and explaining the factual basis and reasoning behind the decision. The
    Registrar invited Dr. Gehl to provide further written submissions if she wished
    to challenge either the Registrar’s factual findings or reasoning.  Dr. Gehl did
    so by letter dated May 2, 1997. The Registrar issued a final denial on April
    27, 1998.</p>

    started an action in the Superior Court of Justice seeking damages against the
    Crown pursuant to s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter</em> and for misfeasance in
    public office. She also sought a declaration that the legislation was
    unconstitutional and declarations that she and her father were entitled to
    registration under the legislation. The Crown moved to strike the statement of claim
    as disclosing no cause of action. The motion was heard by Swinton J., who
    allowed the motion but granted Dr. Gehl leave to amend. Her reasons are found
    at <em>Gehl v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, [2001] 4 C.N.L.R. 108 (Ont.
    S.C.). Justice Swinton found, at para. 13: </p>

    a broad discretion as in <i>Eldridge </i>[<i>v. British Columbia (Attorney
    General)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R 624], when making a decision about entitlement to
    registration; rather, the Registrar is required to determine eligibility for registration
    in accordance with the criteria found in s. 6 of the Act and to determine
    protests in accordance with procedure set out in s. 14.2(4).</p>

    Since “it is not an administrative policy which places obstacles to the plaintiff’s
    registration,” she noted at para. 15, the action based on s. 24(1) of the </span><em>Charter</em><span

    decision was made. The Policy, which formalized the practices that had
    developed within the Registrar’s office over time, did not come into existence
    until well after the litigation had been started. Further, as our colleague
    notes, the Policy is not law and is not amenable to <em>Charter</em> review: <em>Greater
    Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students — British
    Columbia Component</em>, 2009 SCC 31, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 295, at para. 58; <i>Little

    relief based on legal entitlements under the Indian Act. To be clear,
    ordinarily a superior court should decline to hear an application for
    declaratory relief where another procedure has been legislatively provided, as
    in this case. Although the court has a broad jurisdiction to grant declaratory
    relief under s. 97 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43,
    the court can, on a discretionary basis, decline to issue a declaration where,
    as here, Parliament has provided access to as broad a remedy through another
    process: <em>May v. Ferndale Institution</em>, 2005 SCC 82, [2005] 3 S.C.R.

style='line-height:200%'> values analysis would unnecessarily inject
    subjectivity and uncertainty into the legal analysis. Second, there is no need
    to resort to </span><em>Charter</em><span style='line-height:200%'> values to
    displace any deference that an appellate body might owe to the original

  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Charter</em> rights and values should not be invoked in this case</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Gehl has abandoned her constitutional challenge to the legislation
    and is now focused on whether the Registrar’s decision, which applied a rule
    later formalized into a policy, deprives her of rights under the legislation. As
    we have explained, any child who is unable to identify either her father or
    mother is denied the benefits of registration because of an evidential rule
    that in some circumstances frustrates the purpose of the statute. As our
    colleague rightly points out, <span lang=EN-US>the difficulty faced by a
    claimant who is unable to identify a parent will almost always be in
    establishing the identity of a father. But the unreasonableness of the
    Registrar’s decision does not turn on whether the unknown parent is the mother
    or father, and is not best described as a matter of discrimination or
    inequality. The decision would be no less unreasonable if Dr. Gehl had been
    denied registration because of an inability to identify her biological mother
    or grandmother. </span>The appeal to <em>Charter</em> values does not add
    anything to the substantive administrative law analysis, as we noted above, and
    does no work in reaching the outcome. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our objection to the use of <em>Charter</em> values in this appeal is
    not simply because it is unnecessary to the result. There are good reasons why
    the role that <em>Charter</em> values can play in judicial reasoning has been
    carefully circumscribed. One reason is the risk that an appeal to <em>Charter</em> values can pre-empt <em>Charter</em> rights analysis, and thus risk
    subordinating <em>Charter</em> rights. A party bringing a <em>Charter</em> challenge
    is entitled to a judicial determination of whether the <em>Charter</em> right
    has been limited, and the government must have the opportunity to argue that
    such a limit is justified under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>: <em>Symes v.
    Canada</em>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 695, [1993] S.C.J. No. 131, at para. 105 (QL) [<em>per</em> Iacobucci J.]. Our colleague’s reasons elide the two distinct legal concepts of <em>Charter</em> rights and <em>Charter</em> values. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there is good reason to maintain a modest role for <em>Charter</em> values in judicial reasoning generally and in statutory interpretation
    specifically. <em>Charter</em> values lend themselves to subjective application
    because there is no doctrinal structure to guide their identification or application.
     Their use injects a measure of indeterminacy into judicial reasoning because
    of the irremediably subjective – and value laden – nature of selecting some <em>Charter</em> values from among others, and of assigning relative priority among <em>Charter</em> values and competing constitutional and common law principles. The problem of
    subjectivity is particularly acute when <em>Charter</em> values are understood
    as competing with <em>Charter</em> rights.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to the identification and selection of <em>Charter</em> values, it must be noted that they are not a discrete set, like <em>Charter</em> rights, which were the product of a constitutional settlement and are easily
    ascertained by consulting a constitutional text. The identification of <em>Charter</em> values has been <em>ad hoc</em>. Sometimes (as in our colleague’s reason) they
    track the language of an enumerated right, in this case, equality.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other times <em>Charter</em> values have been formulated at a
    much higher level of abstraction – as concepts such as justice, liberty,
    autonomy or dignity: <em>Loyola High School v. Quebec (Attorney General)</em>,
    2015 SCC 12, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 613. The meaning of these concepts – and their juridical
    application – is both contestable and contested.  Philosophers have debated the
    requirements of justice, for example, for thousands of years. The same could be
    said of many other <em>Charter</em> values.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect to their operation in judicial reasoning, problems
    can arise from a lack of clarity about the subordinate relationship of <em>Charter</em> values to <em>Charter</em> rights, the plurality of <em>Charter</em> values,
    and their uncertain relationship to each other and to constitutional and common
    law principles. Unlike <em>Charter</em> rights, which are largely negative and
    will thus rarely conflict, multiple <em>Charter</em> values can simultaneously
    apply in a given dispute, and can easily be in conflict. In this case, for
    example, although equality seems like an apposite value, it is a capacious
    concept that goes beyond the legal right established in s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em>.
    Every conception of equality, as the Supreme Court noted in adopting the words
    of J.H. Schaar in <em>Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia</em>, [1989] 1
    S.C.R. 143, [1989] S.C.J. No. 6, “is at once a psychology, an ethic, a theory
    of social relations, and a vision of the good society” (at para. 26 (QL)). The <em>Charter</em> value of equality potentially competes and conflicts with the autonomy and
    liberty of native bands, principles that were identified as <em>Charter</em> values in <em>R. v. Mabior</em>, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584, at paras.
    44-48, and which, according to the s. 1 <em>Charter</em> evidence tendered in
    this case, informed the compromise that underlies s. 6 of the <em>Indian Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of these and other problems, the Supreme Court has limited the
    role <em>Charter</em> values can play in statutory interpretation. In <em>Bell
    ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</em>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at
    paras. 28, 60-66, the Supreme Court held that <em>Charter</em> values have no
    role in the interpretation of legislation unless the text is ambiguous, in the
    sense that one or more meanings are available that are equally in accordance
    with the intentions of the statute: see, most recently, <em>Wilson v. British
    Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles)</em>, 2015 SCC 47, [2015] 3 S.C.R.
    300, at para. 25.  Absent such ambiguity, <em>Charter</em> values have no role
    to play in statutory interpretation. This stance reinforces our view that a <em>Charter</em> values analysis should be avoided where it is not necessary to the outcome
    sought by the party.</p>

    colleague that deference is not owed to the Registrar, we do not arrive at that
    conclusion on the basis that the Registrar </span>failed “to balance the <i>Charter</i> rights or values at issue with the statutory objective in a reasonable manner,”
    citing <i>Loyola</i>, at para. <span lang=FR-CA>79, and <i>Doré v. Barreau du
    Québec</i>, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 395<i>,</i> at para. </span>49.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We take a more direct route. The Registrar was not exercising
    discretionary power in refusing Dr. Gehl’s registration request, and therefore
    her decision does not attract deference. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'> Deference is required only if the
    administrative decision maker is exercising, as </span><i>Doré </i>prescribes,<span
style='line-height:200%'> a relevant “grant of discretion”. But, as Swinton J.
    observed, no discretionary power is exercised by the Registrar in determining
    whether Dr. Gehl is entitled to registration under the </span><em>Indian Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. </span>The concept of discretion is explained in <i>Baker</i>,
    at para. 52: &quot;The concept of discretion refers to decisions where the law
    does not dictate a specific outcome, or where the decision-maker is given a
    choice of options within a statutorily imposed set of boundaries.&quot; No such
    choice of options is given to the Registrar by s. 6 of the<i> Indian Act</i>.<span
style='line-height:200%'> </span>In &quot;Another View of <i>Baker</i>&quot;
    (1999), 7 R.A.L. 163 at 164, James L.H. Sprague observed, and we agree:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Filling in legislative gaps and making choices among various
    options is not true discretion. That is trying to discern what the legislator
    meant to say. The legislator never said, or intended to say, that where there
    is a gap, the law is to be whatever a decision-maker may decide it should be.
    No, where the decision-maker has to fill in gaps or otherwise interpret law he
    or she is not exercising discretion. He or she is simply doing his or her best
    to ascertain what the law is – he or she is not a law-maker (or at any rate is
    not supposed to be).</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Registrar’s obligation is to administer
    legislation that determines the question of Dr. Gehl’s entitlement. It follows
    that the Registrar must get it right in accordance with the statutory criteria,
    and is subject to an appeal to the Superior Court of Justice on the standard of
    correctness. (In our view it is significant that the statutory appeal is to the
    Superior Court rather than to a statutory body with subject-specific
    expertise.) Although the Registrar, or more likely the officials working under
    the Registrar, might develop some kind of “field sensitivity” and facility in
    researching historical records, in no sense does the Registrar exercise
    discretionary power. Nor is any special expertise exercised by the Registrar in
    determining entitlement. This court does not owe deference to the Registrar and
    does not need to invoke </span><em>Charter</em><span style='line-height:200%'> values in order to overcome deference, as our colleague proposes.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We agree with our colleague that this falls within the category
    of exceptional cases in which remitting the matter to the decision-maker would
    pointless since there is only one possible outcome. Dr. Gehl presented evidence
    from which it could be inferred that her paternal grandfather had status. There
    is no evidence to the contrary. As the motion judge suggested, requiring more
    from Dr. Gehl than the evidence she has provided and a statutory declaration
    that she has no basis for believing that her paternal grandfather would not
    have been entitled to registration goes beyond what, on a reasonable
    interpretation, the Act requires. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
