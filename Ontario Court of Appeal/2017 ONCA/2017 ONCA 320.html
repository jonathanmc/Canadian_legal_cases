  <p class=Judge><strong>Brown J.A.: </strong></p>
  <h1>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In 2006 and 2007, the parties
    to these appeals were shareholders in two successive corporate ventures to
    develop small oil and gas fields in Russia. During the first half of 2006, they
    carried on the venture through Magellan Energy Limited (“Magellan”). By June
    2006 it became apparent Magellan was not the legitimate public company some of
    the shareholders had thought it was; in fact it was a sham public corporation
    promoted by two of the defendants, Irwin Boock (a.k.a. Irwin Krakowsky or John
    Howard) and Stanton De Freitas.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The shareholders thereupon
    re-organized their venture using a new company, Koll Resources Limited
    (“Koll”), to continue it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The shareholders fell into two
    groups. The first consisted of the respondents, Alex Shnaider, Eduard Shyfrin
    and their company, Midland Resources Holding Limited (“Midland”). They put up
    all the funds for the venture – ultimately some US$50 million. Initially,
    Shnaider and Shyfrin advanced funds through Midland; later they personally
    invested in Koll.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Two of the appellants, Michael
    Shtaif and Gregory Roberts, formed part of the second group of shareholders.
    Roberts put up no money for the venture; Shtaif, through his operating company,
    Euro Gas Consulting Inc., covered just over $1 million of the venture’s operating
    expenses. The third appellant, Eugene Bokserman, was not a shareholder, but an
    investment advisor who was involved in arranging Midland’s investment in
    Magellan.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>By mid-2007, each group of
    shareholders had lost trust in the other. Competing lawsuits ensued, in which
    the parties alleged myriad acts of malfeasance against each other. The various
    actions were consolidated into this proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Shnaider, Shyfrin, and Midland
    were the plaintiffs in the consolidated action. Their central claim was that
    the defendants, including the appellants, duped them into investing in a
    project they knew was fraudulent from the start, and then induced them to throw
    good money after bad by investing in Koll in an attempt to recoup their losses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The defendants counterclaimed
    that the plaintiffs were the real fraudsters because they took control of the
    project after the Koll reorganization had failed, depriving the defendants of
    their interest in what they maintain was a potentially lucrative business.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Following a 53-day trial, the
    trial judge released a 166-page decision. Shnaider, Shyfrin, and Midland were
    completely successful. The trial judge accepted their evidence that they were
    induced by the defendants’ deceit to invest millions of dollars in a sham
    corporation. Once that fraud was revealed, the defendants led the plaintiffs to
    believe that they, too, had been duped. The trial judge found that the
    defendants persuaded the plaintiffs to stick with the project on new and
    deliberately misleading terms, causing them further losses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In the end, the trial judge
    awarded the respondents the full measure of compensatory damages they sought
    from the appellants: US$1.5 million from Bokserman, US$8,270,000 from Boock and
    US$59,559,512.97 from Shtaif and Roberts. She dismissed the counterclaims of
    Shtaif and Roberts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Three of the defendants,
    Shtaif, Bokserman, and Roberts, appeal the judgment against them. Roberts also
    appeals the dismissal of his counterclaim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The appellants raise four principal
    objections to the judgment, some of which are raised for the first time on
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>First, they submit that the
    respondents’ claim is precluded by the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> (1843),
    67 E.R. 189, which holds that individual shareholders (such as Shnaider, Shyfrin,
    and Midland) have no cause of action for wrongs done to a corporation (the sham
    company Magellan and its legitimate successor, Koll). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Second, they claim a June 21,
    2006 Settlement Agreement precludes the respondents from asserting any claims
    for the period before that date.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Third, they submit the trial
    judge erred in finding them liable for deceit, unlawful act conspiracy, and
    breach of fiduciary duty. Some of her findings of fact they contend were not
    available to her on the evidence; others were made in respect of claims never
    pleaded.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Fourth, Roberts appeals the
    dismissal of his counterclaim, arguing the trial judge made numerous factual
    errors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>For the reasons that follow, I
    would reject the appellants’ first two arguments based on the rule in <i>Foss
    v. Harbottle</i> and the effect of the Settlement Agreement. I see no error in
    the trial judge’s finding of liability against Bokserman. Nor would I disturb
    her judgment against Shtaif and Roberts for US$8.27 million for their pre-June
    21, 2006 conduct. I would set aside the balance of the judgment against them
    for post-June 21, 2006 conduct, save for their liability for wrongfully
    garnishing certain remnant Magellan accounts. Finally, I would dismiss
    Roberts’s appeal in respect of his counterclaim.</span></p>
  <h1>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>FACTS RELEVANT TO THESE APPEALS</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In her reasons, the trial
    judge exhaustively reviewed the evidence and made clear factual findings. This summary
    of the evidence will focus only on those facts necessary to decide the appeals. </span></p>
  <h2>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The events
    of 2005</h2>
  <h3>The genesis of the venture</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Michael Shtaif was an
    accountant and an oil executive with 15 years’ experience in the oil and gas
    industry. In 2005, he decided to start his own oil production company, which he
    called Euro Gas. He planned to acquire undervalued Russian oil and gas
    companies, consolidate them into one company, and take it public on the TSX. He
    began seeking investors and reviewing potential acquisitions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>As part of his start-up
    efforts, Shtaif made a commission agreement with Eugene Bokserman. Bokserman
    was an investment advisor who had known Shtaif for many years. Through the
    commission agreement, Bokserman agreed to help Shtaif find investors for his
    new business venture.</span></p>
  <h3>October: Shtaif meets Boock/
    Krakowsky/ Howard</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In the fall of 2005, a friend
    of a friend introduced Shtaif via email to a potential investor who said his
    name was John Howard. “Howard” gave off the appearance of being a wealthy
    Toronto businessman. He held himself out as the principal of a public company
    incorporated in the U.S. called BDW Holdings Ltd (later renamed International/ILGY). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Unbeknownst to Shtaif at that
    time, “John Howard” was an alias for Irwin Boock, itself an alias for Irwin
    Krakowsky. Krakowsky had been convicted of securities fraud and market
    manipulation and served time in prison for several frauds, which included
    placing a fraudulent mortgage on his parents’ home. The U.S. Securities and
    Exchange Commission had imposed a trading ban on him. While in prison, Krakowsky
    married and took his wife’s last name, Boock. He also used the aliases David
    Watson and John Sparrow.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The appellant, Gregory Roberts
    – a sometime businessman and lawyer – had known and acted for Boock/Krakowsky/Howard
    for a number of years prior to the events in this proceeding. In 2005, Boock also
    retained Roberts to change his name to Howard, although Roberts testified that
    he did not complete this request, having left the practise of law at the time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In a series of emails, Shtaif
    and “Howard” discussed the possibility of having BDW invest in Shtaif’s
    venture. BDW was listed on the Pink Sheets in the U.S., meaning it did not meet
    the reporting requirements to be listed as a public company on a major
    exchange. “Howard” said that BDW was interested in pursuing oil and gas
    projects. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge agreed with
    the respondents that there were red flags that should have led Shtaif to be
    wary of “Howard”: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Within days of their online introduction and before
    they had met in person, “Howard” suggested Shtaif become the president or executive
    vice-president of BDW, “simply run the show”, and receive six million free
    trading shares, six million restricted shares and six million options in BDW at
    a penny. Shtaif admitted on cross-examination he had found this “suspicious”;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In their initial email exchanges,
    “Howard” emailed Shtaif using an email address for “David Watson”. Even though
    the emails to Shtaif came from “Watson’s” email, it appears that Shtaif knew he
    was dealing with “Howard”;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    report, “Howard” sent him an unaudited balance sheet showing it had just over US$8
    million in assets. “Howard” didn’t provide information about the source of the

    the two had met in person, “Howard” offered Magellan as the corporate vehicle for
    Shtaif’s oil field venture. “Howard” represented Magellan was a Delaware public
    company trading on the Pink Sheets. Shtaif agreed, and BDW issued him 12
    million shares.</span></p>

    as “Howard”, fraudulently created Magellan in early November 2005 specifically
    for Shtaif’s venture. Magellan was not a legitimate public company. The trial
    judge held Boock intended to target Shtaif’s investors and use their
    participation in Magellan to lend it credibility. Boock then planned to
    unlawfully issue free trading shares at artificially inflated prices.</span></p>

    this scheme was a Toronto businessman, the defendant Stanton De Freitas. Both
    Boock and De Freitas later were convicted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission for corporate hijacking - a practice under which a person usurps the
    name and securities ticker number of a defunct or inactive publicly-traded
    corporation for use by a newly-incorporated company - and making unregistered
    offers and sales of the shares of the newly-incorporated companies on the Pink
    Sheets. The Ontario Securities Commission has banned Boock and De Freitas from
    trading in securities, acquiring securities, or acting as directors or officers
    of any issuer.</span></p>

    participating in hijacking Magellan, he admitted that he participated in
    hijacking BDW. He knew that BDW was a sham company and he knew that Boock was falsely
    representing to Shtaif that BDW had the money to invest in Magellan.</span></p>

style='text-decoration:none'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge concluded
    Boock and De Freitas were liable for unlawful conspiracy during this time
    period. Their conduct violated the prohibitions against fraud and market
    manipulation under the <i>Securities Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5, s. 126.1.
    They made promises about Magellan and BDW to induce potential investors that
    they knew would never be fulfilled. Their actions laid the foundation for the
    fraud later perpetrated on the plaintiffs. The trial judge was not prepared to
    conclude that Shtaif was involved in the initial planning of the unlawful
    conspiracy. These findings are not at issue on these appeals.</span></p>

    looking to raise $120 million and that BDW, a “sophisticated Bay Street

style='text-decoration:none'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge accepted the
    evidence of Shnaider and Shyfrin that they would not have agreed to invest $50
    million in the proposed venture without BDW’s commitment of $70 million. They
    were both of the view that $50 million was insufficient to create even a
    medium-sized oil company. With a total investment of $120 million, they thought
    the venture could succeed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge found Shtaif

    Bokserman knew BDW was not a “sophisticated Bay Street investor”, as Shtaif had
    represented it to be. As well, he knew investment bankers and banks were wary
    of companies, such as BDW, that traded on the Pink Sheets. She found Bokserman
    intended to deceive the plaintiffs into investing because he wanted to make his
    commission. She assessed Midland’s damages against Bokserman at US$1.5 million,
    the amount of the commission he ended up receiving from Magellan’s funds in April
    2006.</span></p>

    Shtaif: (i) knew the representation that BDW would invest $70 million in the
    project was false based on the red flags preceding “Howard’s” offer; (ii) knew
    that BDW, at most, had around $8 million; (iii) intended to convince Shnaider
    and Shyfrin that BDW was wealthier and better funded than he knew it to be to
    induce them to invest $50 million in Magellan; and (iv) knew the respondents would

    sent Shnaider an “engagement letter” on Magellan letterhead stating that BDW already
    had transferred $8 million to Magellan. At trial, Shtaif admitted he had
    received no confirmation from “Howard” that the money had been transferred, and
    he knew by December 27, 2005 at the latest that BDW had not paid anything. On
    that date, Boock, using the name “Watson”, sent a letter stating that BDW was
    prepared to transfer the “first portion” of its funding to Magellan, in the
    amount of $2 million.</span></p>

    duped him about BDW having paid anything to Magellan. Once he knew that
    Magellan had not transferred the promised $8 million, Shtaif had a positive
    obligation to inform the respondents the money had not been transferred, as he
    had earlier represented. The trial judge found that his failure to do so was
    deceitful.</span></p>

    emailed Shtaif, confirming Midland would invest $50 million in Magellan on two
    conditions: first, it would receive 40% of the Magellan shares; and second,

    BDW already had paid $8 million, with the balance of its $70 million on the
    way.</span></p>

    $50 million would not be sufficient capital to create an oil company. Shtaif knew
    they would be interested only if there was another investor willing to invest
    $70 million; he presented BDW as that investor. The trial judge found Shtaif:
    (i) used Magellan’s purported public company status and BDW’s promises to pay a
    total of $70 million to induce Midland to invest, knowing BDW was not what it
    was representing itself to be; (ii) knew Magellan then would secure $50 million
    in funding regardless of whether BDW paid; and (iii) had no honest belief BDW

    called his business friend and former lawyer, Roberts, and asked him to be BDW’s
    representative on Magellan’s board. “Howard” gave Roberts two million Magellan
    shares out of the eight million he had transferred to himself. Roberts paid
    nothing for those shares. “Howard” also promised Roberts a US$80,000 annual

    and De Freitas targeted Midland in part to lend legitimacy to Magellan and to
    make it easier to pump the value of the shares it was intending to unlawfully
    issue and sell. Shtaif targeted Midland because he wanted its $50 million to
    build his venture, even though he knew Midland’s participation was premised on
    BDW’s sham commitment of $70 million.</span></p>

    so, in part, by suggesting an unnamed third party was prepared to buy
    Magellan’s shares at a higher price than Midland. The unnamed third party was
    BDW. “Howard” and Shtaif knew BDW’s higher offer was a bogus one and was
    specifically intended to induce Midland to put up its US$50 million. The trial

    congratulatory emails sent when Midland finally advanced its US$50 million – stating,

    said at the April 28 board meeting. Shtaif said De Freitas had misled him. He
    also revealed that, somehow, four million free trading shares in Magellan had
    been issued without board knowledge or approval. Shtaif told Shnaider Magellan
    would have to get rid of BDW and find other investors. He told Shnaider that
    would not be a problem; other investors were lined up to replace BDW. </span></p>

    noted in her decision the suggestion made by respondents’ counsel that Shtaif
    and Roberts hired Beach to discover what they already knew – that it would not be
    possible to move Magellan to a higher exchange because it was a sham. Beach

    value of Reef and SibinTek to induce Midland to stay in the venture. He
    convinced Shnaider they had had a rough start, but going forward everything

    Keloglu, his deputy at Euro Gas, and Tsygankov, the lawyer for Arthur
    Poltoranin who was the principal of a company called Reagent (by a later
    agreement Poltoranin was named as the client of the safety deposit box).
    Reagent purported to own 40% of the shares of the vendor, SibinTek. However, at

    with the treasury notes. On the contrary, the trial judge found Shtaif assured
    them that Reagent had proper title to the SibinTek shares (which had not been
    confirmed) and the White &amp; Case lawyers had advised that it was safe to
    close the SibinTek deal (which they had not). </span></p>

    serious problems with SibinTek. The trial judge held Shtaif lied to the
    plaintiffs to induce them to stay in the venture. She further found that, had

    Shtaif, respectively. Shnaider and Shyfrin resigned from the Magellan board to
    avoid any conflict, and the remaining members voted to return to Midland what

    also knew that should the SibinTek deal did not close, Poltoranin could still
    access some of the treasury notes lodged in the safety deposit box. He made

    million in Koll, they would advance US$50 million as a loan to the company.
    They would also retain 67% of the shares. Shtaif would hold the remaining
    shares to distribute as he saw fit. Shtaif agreed to the new terms, but he
    testified he signed the loan agreement “under duress”, at a Moscow police

    they purportedly incurred while acting for Magellan. Roberts later discovered

    He moved for consent judgments on the two promissory notes in a manner that can
    only be described as misleading the court – he arranged for Boock/Krakowsky/Howard,
    now using the alias John Sparrow, to consent to judgment on behalf of Magellan
    when he had no authority to do so. Roberts then garnished the funds in the
    Faskens and TD accounts in satisfaction of the judgments. Neither Roberts nor

    trial judge found Shtaif and Roberts knew these valuations were “false and

  <h1>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>COMMON ISSUES</h1>
  <h2>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Standing:
    The application of the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i></h2>
  <h3>The issue stated</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The appellants argue that if
    they committed any legal wrongs, the entities directly injured by their acts
    were the corporations - Magellan and, subsequently, Koll - not their
    shareholders, the respondents. As a result, the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> prevents the respondents, as shareholders, from bringing suit to recover
    damages for any wrongs caused to the corporations, Magellan and Koll, absent
    leave to bring a derivative action, which the respondents did not seek: <i>Hercules
    Management Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165, at para. 59; <i>BCE
    Inc. v. 1976 Debentureholders</i>, 2008 SCC 69, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 560, at para.
    43. The appellants therefore contend the trial judge erred in law by granting any
    judgment in favour of Midland.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The respondents state the
    appellants are raising the <i>Foss v. Harbottle </i>argument for the first time
    on appeal, and the court should decline to entertain it on this basis alone. In
    any event, they argue this submission is misconceived: the respondents did not
    sue as shareholders of Magellan and Koll seeking damages for wrongs done to
    those corporations, but as investors who were duped by the appellants into
    pouring millions of dollars into a sham public company, Magellan, and then
    induced to throw good money after bad by re-investing in Koll in an effort to
    recoup their losses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The respondents further submit
    that even if the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> applies, it only affects their
    fiduciary duty claims against Shtaif and Roberts as those are the only ones which
    could be characterized as derivative. By contrast, the fraudulent
    misrepresentation and unlawful conspiracy claims are personal ones by the respondent
    investors against those who induced them to invest in Magellan and Koll.</span></p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants did not specifically plead the claim was barred by the
    rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Rule 25.07(4) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> requires a defendant to plead any matter on which he
    intends to rely to defeat the claim of the opposite party and which, if not
    specifically pleaded, &quot;might take the opposite party by surprise or raise
    an issue that has not been raised in the opposite party's pleading.&quot; This
    requires a party to plead an affirmative defence, such as a plaintiff's lack of
    standing to sue: <i>Concord Kitchens GP Inc. v. Eastern Construction Company
    Limited</i>, 2010 ONSC 2168, at paras. 102-105; <i>Huber v. Way</i>, 2014 ONSC
    4426, at paras. 66-68.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The reason for this pleading
    rule is quite simple. The just determination of a civil proceeding on its
    merits requires a fair adjudicative process. Trial by ambush is not fair.
    Accordingly, trial unfairness may result where a defendant is permitted to rely
    on an unpleaded defence which, if pleaded, might have prompted counsel to employ
    different tactics at trial: <i>Strong v. Paquet Estate</i> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d)
    70 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 532, at para. 37. As
    this court stated in <i>Hav-A-Kar Leasing</i>, 2012 ONCA 826, at paras. 69-70:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The failure to raise substantive responses to a plaintiff’s
    claims until trial or, worse, until the close of trial, is contrary to the
    spirit and requirements of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> and the goal of
    fair contest that underlies those Rules. Such a failure also undermines the
    important principle that the parties to a civil lawsuit are entitled to have
    their differences resolved on the basis of the issues joined in the pleadings….
    [W]here a defence to a civil action is not pleaded and no pleadings amendment
    is obtained, judges should generally resist the inclination to allow a
    defendant to raise and rely on the unpleaded defence if trial fairness and the
    avoidance of prejudice to the plaintiff are to be achieved. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The rule is not absolute. This
    court has excused defendants from their failure to raise an affirmative defence
    in the pleadings where the issue was otherwise clearly raised and put in issue
    before trial: <i>Reliable Life Insurance Company v. M.H. Ingle &amp; Associates
    Insurance Brokers Ltd.</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 36. However,
    raising a potentially dispositive issue during closing submissions, after the
    close of evidence, may well prove too late. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In the present case, Shtaif
    acknowledged in oral argument that he was raising a <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> argument for the first time on appeal. On his part, Roberts appears to have
    raised <i>Foss v. Harbottle </i>for the first time at trial in a short passage </span><span
style='text-decoration:none'>in his written closing and then his oral closing
    submissions. However, the appellants did not raise the issue in any of their
    pleadings, or in their opening written or oral statements at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>There are two procedural reasons
    why I would not give effect to the appellants' <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> argument.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>First, the appellants’
    tardiness in raising this defence and waiting until the appeal to raise it in
    any substantive way works an unfairness on the respondents: <i>Kaiman v. Graham</i>,
    2009 ONCA 77, 45 E.T.R. (3d) 163,</span><span style='font-size:10.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Georgia&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:#212121;text-decoration:
none'> </span><span style='text-decoration:none'>at para. 18. </span><span
style='text-decoration:none'>Had they specifically pleaded a <i>Foss v.
    Harbottle</i> defence, the respondents submit they could have sought leave to
    bring a derivative action <i>nunc pro tunc</i>. Instead, the respondents only
    had a limited opportunity to reply to Roberts’s last minute raising of the
    defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Second, the appellants'
    submission is inconsistent with the position they took at trial on their
    counterclaims. Shtaif and Roberts did not view the rule in <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> as precluding their counterclaims against the respondents based on allegations
    the parties were fiduciaries in respect of the Koll portion of their business
    venture. Accordingly, there is merit in the respondents’ submission that had
    the appellants pleaded a <i>Foss v. Harbottle </i>defence, they would have undercut
    the foundation for their own counterclaims. </span></p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents’ allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation and
    conspiracy are direct, personal claims that are not barred by the rule in <i>Foss
    v. Harbottle</i></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In any event, the appellants'
    submission mischaracterizes the real nature of the respondents' claims. The
    respondents do not allege the directors of Magellan or Koll failed to exercise
    the requisite care and diligence in discharging their duties by mismanaging those
    corporations’ investments in oil fields, thereby causing financial losses that harmed
    the respondents as shareholders. Instead, the respondents allege the individual
    appellants engaged in deceit and conspiracies to induce them to part with their
    money and invest in Magellan and Koll. Those claims are personal in nature,
    seeking damages for tortious harm directly caused to the respondents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The rule in <i>Foss v.
    Harbottle</i> does not preclude a shareholder from maintaining a claim for harm
    done directly to it: <i>Meditrust Healthcare Inc. v. Shoppers Drug Mart</i> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 786 (C.A.), at para. 16. As this court stated in <i>Goldex
    Mines Ltd. v. Revill</i> (1974), 7 O.R. (2d) 216 (C.A.), at p. 221: “Where a
    legal wrong is done to shareholders by directors or other shareholders, the
    injured shareholders suffer a personal wrong, and may seek redress for it in a
    personal action.” This principle was re-iterated in <i>Hercules Managements
    Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i> where the Supreme Court stated, at para. 62: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[S]hareholders cannot raise individual claims in respect of a
    wrong done to the corporation...Where, however, a separate and distinct claim
    (say, in tort) can be raised with respect to a wrong done to a shareholder <i>qua</i> individual, a personal action may well lie, assuming that all the requisite
    elements of a cause of action can be made out.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The Quebec Court of Appeal
    recently canvassed the issue of direct versus indirect harm in its decision in <i>Groupe
    d’action d’investisseurs dans Biosyntech v. Tsang</i>, 2016 QCCA 1923,
    dismissing an appeal from the motion judge’s refusal to certify a class action
    brought by shareholders against directors of the corporation for loss in share
    value. In the course of considering whether the damages claimed by the
    shareholders were direct or indirect – the core issue in the case - the Quebec
    Court of Appeal observed, at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>Another example of direct damage
    suffered by a shareholder resulting from the acts of a director was described
    by the judge as the hypothetical case of the shareholder who purchases his
    shares based on the negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation of directors.
    Such a scenario causes the shareholder to have parted with his money to buy
    worthless shares and thus, suffers harm independent from the company giving
    rise to a good cause of action against directors for damages directly suffered
    by the shareholder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge found on the
    “unusual facts” of this case that Midland, the shareholder, did suffer a direct
    injury or loss by reason of the appellants’ conduct. I see no error in those
    findings. The appellants’ conduct caused Midland to invest monies in Magellan,
    providing that company effectively with its sole source of operational funding.
    Midland claims for the loss of that investment. That distinguishes the present
    case from the typical “indirect loss” case in which a shareholder seeks to
    recover the loss of share value because the manner of operations of the
    corporation depressed the market price for its stock.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Consequently, the rule in <i>Foss
    v. Harbottle</i> does not apply to the respondents' claims for fraudulent misrepresentation
    and conspiracy. I will deal with their claims for breach of fiduciary duty
    later in these reasons.</span></p>
  <h2>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect
    of the Settlement Agreement on the respondents’ claims</h2>
  <h3>The issue stated</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The June 21, 2006 Settlement
    Agreement brought the Magellan venture to an end, with the parties
    reconstituting their oil field development project in Koll. The Settlement
    Agreement was between two parties only - Magellan and Midland. It defined
    Midland’s earlier purchase of Magellan shares for $50 million as the
    “Acquisition”, and s. 1 stated: “The Acquisition is hereby rescinded.” Midland
    returned its share certificate to Magellan. In consideration for the
    certificate’s return, in s. 2 of the Settlement Agreement Magellan agreed to:
    (i) pay Midland “in immediately available funds” US$36.328 million; (ii) assign
    to Midland all of its rights in the two Magellan subsidiaries involved in the
    SibinTek and Reef transactions, as well as those transactions’ purchase
    agreements; and (iii) issue Midland a Magellan secured demand promissory note
    for US$1.67 million, which covered, in part, the commission paid to Bokserman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The appellants submit the
    trial judge failed to appreciate the Settlement Agreement prevented the
    respondents from bringing action on any torts committed before June 21, 2006
    because under the agreement Magellan and Midland were deemed to release one
    another as of June 20, 2006. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>As with the first issue, the respondents
    submit the appellants are raising this argument for the first time on appeal
    and the court should not consider it. In any event, they say the argument ignores
    the fact that when the Settlement Agreement was made, the respondents were not
    aware Shtaif was involved in a conspiracy with Boock/Krakowsky/“Howard” and De
    Freitas, or that Shtaif had deceived them about the status of the SibinTek
    transaction. In those circumstances, they submit, rescission of the Magellan
    agreement cannot absolve the appellants of liability.</span></p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The appellants did not plead that
    the Settlement Agreement operated to release all pre-June 21, 2006 claims; nor
    did they raise the defence at trial. On that basis alone, it is not now open to
    them to assert such a defence as a ground for setting aside the judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In any event, the appellants’
    submission cannot succeed. The terms of the Settlement Agreement, and the
    circumstances surrounding its making, do not support the appellants’ argument that
    the agreement constituted an unequivocal expression by the respondents to
    rescind Midland’s share subscription in Magellan by reason of the appellants’
    fraud and thereby place all parties <i>in status quo ante</i>: <i>Guarantee Co.
    of North America v. Gordon Capital Corp.</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 423, at para. 39.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>First, the appellants were not
    parties to the Settlement Agreement; it contains no terms for their benefit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Second, Midland gave no
    release of claims in the agreement; by contrast, Magellan released the
    respondents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'> Third, the Settlement
    Agreement contained no provision purporting to release the appellants from
    claims unknown to the respondents at the time the agreement was made. As of
    June 21, 2006, the respondents were not aware of the extent of the risk to the SibinTek
    treasury notes, which ultimately resulted in a loss of just over $6 million of
    the funds invested by Midland. As a result, notwithstanding the assignment of
    Magellan’s rights in the SibinTek transaction, the respondents suffered a loss caused
    by Shtaif’s deceitful conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Finally, the Magellan
    promissory note lacked any value; it did not result in Midland recouping the
    funds used to pay Bokserman his commission because Magellan never had any
    assets other than the funds invested by Midland.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    why the trial judge erred in holding him liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>First, Bokserman submits his
    representation to Shnaider that BDW was a sophisticated Bay Street investor was
    true because it was never proven at trial that the individuals behind BDW were
    not sophisticated Bay Street investors. This submission runs aground on the
    trial judge’s findings, which were not contested, that the person behind BDW –
    Boock/ Krakowsky/Howard – had a criminal record, including convictions for
    fraud, was prohibited from trading by the Ontario Securities Commission, and
    was operating under an alias or changed name. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Second, Bokserman argues the
    alleged misrepresentations concerned BDW’s future intentions to invest US$70
    million in Magellan and, as such, were not actionable statements of fact. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>I disagree. Bokserman’s representations
    were based on an existing, purported “fact”: that BDW was made up of sophisticated
    Bay Street investors who were committed to funding the Magellan venture. The
    fact they had not yet advanced funds is irrelevant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Finally, Bokserman advances a three-pronged
    argument disputing the respondents suffered damages as a result of his
    misrepresentations. The first prong challenges the trial judge’s findings that
    without Bokserman’s assurances, the respondents would not have invested in
    Magellan and Bokserman would not have received his US$1.5 million commission –
    a commission paid using Midland’s investment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>While the respondents’
    pleading alleged Bokserman’s representation led Shnaider to “express an
    interest” in investing, the evidence at trial was that Shnaider relied on
    Bokserman’s representation in deciding to invest. It was open to the trial
    judge to make the findings of reliance she did on the record before her. I see
    no basis for appellate interference with them. Moreover, the respondents were
    not required to establish that they relied only on that misrepresentation,
    simply that it contributed to their decision and was one of the facts that
    induced them to act: <i>Fiorillo v. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc.</i> (2009), 98
    O.R. (3d) 103 (S.C.), at para. 91.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The second prong contends
    Midland cannot recover damages because it was Magellan that paid Bokserman’s
    commission. Of course, the only funds Magellan had, came from Midland. This argument
    essentially is a variant of the <i>Foss v. Harbottle</i> submission, which I
    have rejected.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The final prong argues Midland
    suffered no damage because under the Settlement Agreement it received a
    Magellan promissory note that covered, in part, the amount of the commission
    paid to Bokserman. Apart from the financial reality that the note lacked any
    value, the Settlement Agreement did not contain any release of claims by
    Midland against Bokserman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>For these reasons, I would dismiss
    Bokserman’s appeal.</span></p>

    including Shnaider and Shyfrin, attended the company’s February 19, 2006 board
    meeting in Moscow (the “February Board meeting”). It was Roberts’s first

    a director by failing to disclose to the Board material information, including that
    “Howard” really was Boock/Krakowsky, who had a criminal record for fraud and
    was using a changed name or alias. The trial judge accepted the evidence of
    Shnaider and Shyfrin that had Roberts disclosed such information to the Board, they
    would not have proceeded with Magellan.</span></p>

    February 19, 2006 that Howard was Boock and that he had a criminal record. Had
    Roberts done so, the rescission of Midland's contract would have been
    unnecessary and Midland would not have suffered a direct resulting loss of
    $8,270,000 net. While Roberts's and Shtaif's and De Freitas's fiduciary duty
    was to Magellan, on the unusual facts here their breaches of their duties to
    Magellan&nbsp;caused Midland’s damages of $8,270,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Roberts concedes he owed a fiduciary
    duty to Magellan, but submits the trial judge erred by allowing Midland to
    recover damages for his breach of it. He submits that as a Magellan director,
    he owed a fiduciary duty only to the corporation, not to its shareholders,
    following <i>BCE</i>, at para. 66. Since the respondents did not have a direct
    cause of action against him as the beneficiaries of a fiduciary duty, and since
    they did not bring a derivative action in respect of any damages caused by his
    breach to Magellan, Roberts contends the trial judge erred in granting Midland
    damages for his failure to disclose material facts at the February Board
    meeting.</span></p>

style='text-decoration:none'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Roberts submits the
    information he possessed about “Howard’s” criminal background and his change of
    name were not material because, by the time of the February Board meeting, Midland
    already had signed the agreement to subscribe for Magellan shares. That argument
    is a non-starter. First, such information struck at the root of the legitimacy
    of Magellan as a public company, and Roberts was required to disclose it
    regardless of whether the respondents had made some, all, or none of their
    investment in Magellan. The trial judge accepted Shnaider’s evidence that had
    Roberts disclosed this information, he would have realized that this was a
    “pump and dump” scheme and would have declined to further participate in
    Magellan. There is no basis upon which to interfere with that finding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Moreover, while Midland signed
    the share subscription agreement in January 2006, it did not advance its $50
    million to Magellan until early April 2006, well after the February Board
    meeting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Given what Roberts knew about
    “Howard’s” criminal past, he had two options. First, as the trial judge pointed
    out, if he believed the information was privileged and non-disclosable because
    he had obtained it during the course of doing prior legal work for
    Boock/Krakowsky/Howard, “given its materiality, he should not have agreed to
    join the Board.” From the trial judge’s findings, it is clear why Roberts did
    not take that option. He had much to gain personally by Midland’s injection of
    funds into Magellan – the appreciation in value of his two million Magellan
    shares and a US$80,000 annual director’s fee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Roberts’s second option was to
    open his mouth and tell his fellow directors about “Howard’s” real identity and
    criminal past. That he did not do; no doubt for the same reason of not wanting
    to jeopardize any future personal gain.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>So, Roberts kept silent. In so
    doing, he egregiously breached his duty as a director to make timely disclosure
    of material information to Magellan’s Board.</span></p>
  <h3>Midland cannot recover against
    Roberts on the basis of breach of fiduciary duty</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Roberts contends his silence
    at the February, 2006 Board meeting attracts no legal liability to Midland
    because his director’s duty was owed only to Magellan and, as a result, Midland
    cannot recover any damages resulting from it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Directors owe their fiduciary
    obligation to the corporation: <i>Peoples</i>, at para. 43; <i>BCE</i>, at
    para. 66. And, in <i>BCE</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that
    “[n]ormally only the beneficiary of a fiduciary duty can enforce the duty”:
    para. 41. The court acknowledged this could work a harsh result because “the
    directors who control the corporation are unlikely to bring an action against
    themselves for breach of their own fiduciary duty”: para. 41. However, in light
    of the availability of several other remedies to shareholders – such as the
    oppression remedy, a derivative action, or an action based on a director’s duty
    of care – the Supreme Court has resisted characterizing corporate stakeholders
    as the beneficiaries of directors’ statutory fiduciary duties: <i>Peoples</i>,
    at para. 53; <i>BCE</i>, at paras. 42-45.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>That said, a director may owe
    an <i>ad hoc</i> fiduciary duty to a shareholder, especially in “situations
    involving a family or other close special relationships of trust and dependency
    between the claimant and the defendant director, in which the director was
    seeking to take advantage of that relationship for personal gain or profit”:

    401-2; affirmed 2014 ONCA 479. However, although the respondents pleaded the
    existence of an <i>ad hoc </i>fiduciary duty owed by Roberts to Shnaider and
    Shyfrin, the trial judge made no factual findings that such a duty arose in the
    circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Thus, on the current state of
    the law, the trial judge’s implicit holding that Midland, as a shareholder,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In the present case, the trial
    judge relied, in part, on the Minutes of the February Board meeting to find
    that Roberts did not disclose “Howard’s” real identity and conviction for fraud
    or that Roberts had acted for “Howard” in the past. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Those Minutes reveal two
    critical facts about the context in which the Board’s discussion took place.
    First, Roberts was identified as a director “representing the interests of BDW
    Holdings Ltd.,” the touted senior investor in Magellan associated with “Howard”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Second, the Minutes show the
    Board agreed that the initial subscribers for Magellan shares – the most
    significant of which were BDW and Midland – were to pay for their subscriptions
    within 21 days. Notwithstanding that Roberts concurred in that Board decision,
    as his signature to the Minutes attests, he remained silent about the true
    identity and criminal past of the principal behind the largest subscriber, BDW,
    the company whose interests other Magellan directors understood he was
    representing. Roberts’s silence on those material facts lent an air of
    legitimacy to BDW as the senior subscriber for Magellan shares that BDW did not
    possess because of “Howard’s” involvement in it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Further, the discussion at the
    February Board meeting, as recorded in the Minutes, made it clear to Roberts
    that Midland was being asked to pay for its Magellan shares within 21 days.
    Roberts therefore knew that his silence about the true identity and criminal past
    of BDW’s principal would result in Midland investing funds in Magellan in
    ignorance of BDW’s real circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>In short, the trial judge’s
    findings disclose Roberts knew the information he possessed about “Howard’s”
    criminal past and name change was material, and he intended the respondents to
    rely on the favourable impression about BDW created by his silence. The
    respondents acted to their detriment in relying on Roberts’s non-disclosure and
    the trial judge accepted that “had this information been disclosed to the
    Magellan Board, the Board would not have proceeded with Magellan.” Midland
    suffered a direct loss as a result.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>But, the respondents did not
    specifically plead that Roberts’s silence amounted to a fraudulent
    misrepresentation. Does such an omission require this court to set aside that
    part of the judgment imposing US$8.27 million liability on Roberts to Midland
    for his pre-June 21, 2006 conduct? In my view, it does not. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Yet, later in these reasons I
    conclude the respondents’ failure to plead fraudulent misrepresentation
    justifies setting aside most of that portion of the judgment in respect of the
    post-June 21, 2006 conduct of Roberts and Shtaif. Is it inconsistent to uphold
    part of the judgment on a basis not specifically pleaded, but set aside another
    part by reason of want of a proper pleading? I think not; the circumstances of the
    two situations differ materially.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Unlike the circumstances in
    respect of that part of the judgment based on the post-June 21, 2006
    IPO-related statements of Roberts and Shtaif, the respondents clearly pleaded
    Roberts committed a wrongful act by not disclosing material information about
    “Howard” at the February Board meeting and Midland suffered a loss as a result.
    The respondents also squarely put in issue Roberts’s wrongful conduct at the February
    Board meeting and the relief they sought for it during the trial, directly
    cross-examining Roberts on the point. In their closing submission, they also
    advanced fraudulent misrepresentation by silence as an alternative basis for
    finding Roberts liable in respect of the February Board meeting. Accordingly, I
    see no unfairness to Roberts by upholding this part of the judgment - throughout
    the trial he knew the case he had to meet in respect of his conduct at the February
    Board meeting.</span></p>

  <h1>VII.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SHTAIF’S APPEAL: OTHER GROUNDS CONCERNING PRE-JUNE 21, 2006 CONDUCT</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:avoid'><b><span
style='text-decoration:none'>Liability for deceit</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge found Shtaif
    liable to Midland for deceit and unlawful conspiracy in respect of conduct that
    took place before June 21, 2006, which caused Midland damages of $8.27 million.
    The trial judge calculated the $8.27 million by deducting the amount of the
    SibinTek treasury notes recovered by Midland ($5.4 million), from the aggregate
    of $13.67 million in Midland funds that Magellan used to fund the failed
    SibinTek transaction, together with the commission paid to Bokserman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Some of the pre-June 21, 2006
    fraudulent misrepresentations for which the trial judge found Shtaif liable
    were: (i) stating BDW was a sophisticated Bay Street investor committed to
    investing US$70 million in the venture; (ii) as of December 20, 2005 BDW
    already had transferred US$8 million to Magellan; (iii) advising in late March
    2006 that Magellan had received a higher third party offer for its shares; (iv)
    stating Magellan had received US$10 million from BDW by April 5, 2006; (v)
    continuing that deceit through the period until May 16, 2006; and (vi)
    continuing misrepresentations between May 23 and June 20, 2006 that all was
    well with the SibinTek acquisition.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Although Shtaif broadly
    submits the trial judge erred in finding him liable, he does not point to any
    palpable and overriding error of fact in the trial judge’s deceit findings. In
    fact, at the hearing of the appeal, Shtaif’s counsel stated he was not
    challenging the trial judge’s findings of fact. In any event, the trial judge’s
    reasons analyzed each of those allegations of deceit, and ample evidence
    supported her findings of liability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>That conclusion is sufficient
    to dismiss Shtaif’s appeal of that portion of the judgment awarding damages against
    him of US$8.27 million for Midland’s pre-June 21, 2006 losses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Shtaif, however, raises three additional
    grounds of appeal in respect of other findings of liability for his pre-June
    21, 2006 conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>First, he submits the trial
    judge erred in finding him liable in deceit for a May  2006 statement about the
    worth of Reef. As with Roberts, that ground of appeal raises issues similar to
    those concerning the trial judge’s findings of deceit against both Shtaif and
    Roberts for post-June 21, 2006 statements. I will deal with all the statements
    together in Part VIII of these reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Shtaif also argues the trial
    judge erred in finding him liable for (i) breach of fiduciary duty and (ii)
    unlawful conduct conspiracy.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>Liability for breach of
    fiduciary duty</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge found Shtaif
    breached his fiduciary duty as a director to Magellan by failing to disclose to
    the company’s Board that (i) he owned 12 million BDW shares, (ii) Magellan’s
    share price was being manipulated, and (iii) the risks to the SibinTek treasury
    notes. Her findings of liability based on Shtaif’s breaches of fiduciary duty to
    Magellan suffer from the same legal error as that made in regard to Roberts’
    breach of fiduciary duty – Midland was not the beneficiary of the duty and
    could not recover for its breach. However, the errors have no effect on the
    judgment of U.S. $8.27 million against Shtaif for his pre-June 21, 2006 conduct
    given the trial judge’s findings against him of deceit, described in para. 176
    above.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Liability for unlawful conspiracy</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge also found
    Shtaif liable to the respondents for damages in the amount of U.S. $8.27
    million on the basis of his participation in an unlawful conduct conspiracy.
    Shtaif challenges that conclusion, not on the ground that the trial judge erred
    in her findings of fact, but on the basis that the respondents failed to plead
    unlawful conduct conspiracy “with any precision or particularity”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>For several reasons, I am not
    persuaded by Shtaif’s submission. First, the respondents’ Amended Fresh as
    Amended Statement of Claim contained lengthy and particularized allegations
    describing the unlawful conduct conspiracy, including Shtaif’s role in it and
    the unlawful conduct – deceit and violations of s. 126.1 of the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5. Second, in his pleading Shtaif did not challenge
    the adequacy of the respondents’ pleading of conspiracy; instead, he pleaded
    over and denied the allegations. Finally, Shtaif fully responded to the
    respondents’ conspiracy allegations at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Summary</p>

style='text-decoration:none'>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>By way of summary, the trial
    judge’s findings on the deceits described in para. 176 above firmly supported

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Shtaif and Roberts liable for deceit in respect of statements made about the
    possible future value of Magellan, and then Koll, upon the completion of an
    IPO. The strategic business plan of Magellan, and then Koll, contemplated the
    acquisition of several oil and gas fields followed by the issuance of an IPO.
    Roberts, and to a lesser degree Shtaif, worked to gauge the interest of the
    (largely) Canadian investment banking community in such an IPO. They reported
    back to members of the boards, including Shnaider and Shyfrin, about the
    results of their discussions with investment bankers. </span></p>

style='text-decoration:none'>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge held that
    statements made by Shtaif and Roberts about the results of those discussions
    and the value of the Reef oil field (the “IPO-related Statements”) constituted deceits. </span></p>

    contained in Roberts’s May 16, 2006 email to Magellan directors as an
    additional basis to find him liable for $8.27 million in damages for Midland’s
    pre-June 21, 2006 losses. Specifically, she found, at para. 1030, statements in
    that email amounted to deceit:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>Roberts wrote Ex. 18/Tab 120 to
    Shnaider, Shyfrin, Shtaif, De Freitas, and Groag, opining that as a result of

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Second, the trial judge found
    that sometime in May 2006 Shtaif represented to Shyfrin that Reef was worth
    $250 million, although she does not identify the specific occasion on which Shtaif
    made such a statement. She held that statement induced the respondents in
    mid-May 2006 to continue in the Magellan venture.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge then relied on
    further statements made by Shtaif and Roberts in September 2006 and in February
    16 and 18, 2007 documents as the basis for attaching liability to them for the
    balance of the judgment of $46,105,879.43: at paras. 1180 and 1186. </span></p>

    specific statements made by Shtaif or Roberts. Instead, she referred to
    comments contained in a presentation prepared by one of the investment bankers,
    CIBC, which subsequently were summarized in the minutes of the Koll September
    30, 2006 board meeting.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Roberts circulated a February
    16, 2007 memo to the Koll board with his “recommendations for a fair

    none-the-less of the issues we face” (emphasis added). Although the trial judge
    did not specifically refer to this memo in the extract from her reasons set out
    above, it is the only memo of Roberts “after the end of January 2007” dealing
    with Koll’s ability to raise financing.</span></p>

    the pleadings, from the evidence led at trial (in many cases by the
    Appellants), and from the parties’ closing submissions. The Appellants had

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>I would accept the submissions

    didn’t believe it’s going to be such a large amount of money, but I believed

    submission, Midland's damages against Shtaif would have been the same as those
    caused by Boock and De Freitas. Without further misrepresentations by Roberts
    and Shtaif after July 15, 2006, about the value of Reef, and the views of the
    investment bankers, and Koll's prospects on the IPO, I would have seriously
    questioned the Plaintiffs' assertion that Midland was justified in continuing
    to inject into Koll the balance of the $50 million, in order to mitigate their
    earlier damages.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Should a higher court find that I should have accepted this
    submission, I note that by July 15, Midland had advanced a further $18.5
    million to purchase Reef. By December 2006 it had advanced another $9.5 million
    to purchase Invenskoye. As at March 1, 2007, $41,900,000 had been expended on
    Koll.</p>

    finding any liability in respect of the IPO-related Statements does not affect
    her findings of liability of US$8.27 million against both Shtaif and Roberts for
    their pre-June 21, 2006 conduct. However, as I indicated in para. 102 above,
    the trial judge should not have awarded Midland damages for advances made after
    June 21, 2006. Her finding of liability against those appellants for post-June
    21, 2006 Midland advances rested on her conclusion that the IPO-related Statements
    constituted deceits. Since I have found she erred in so concluding, the balance
    of the judgments against Shtaif and Roberts for post-June 21, 2006 conduct must
    be set aside, save for their liability in respect of the Magellan promissory
    notes. </span></p>

  <h3>The issue stated</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[206]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>As described earlier, on June
    21, 2006, before he resigned as Magellan’s CEO, Shtaif signed Magellan
    promissory notes in favour of himself (over $1.28 million) and Roberts (US$44,796).
    Shnaider and Shyfrin were not told about these notes. Notwithstanding that
    under the Settlement Agreement all remaining Magellan cash was to be returned
    to Midland, Roberts subsequently located Magellan funds in Faskens’ trust
    account and the TD Bank. He commenced lawsuits on the notes, secured Boock/Krakowsky/Howard’s
    cooperation to deceive the court to obtain consent judgments, and then
    garnished the trust and bank accounts to satisfy the judgments in favour of
    Shtaif and himself.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[207]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge found Shtaif
    and Roberts liable for wrongful conduct conspiracy for their seizure of those Magellan
    funds and gave judgment against them in the amount of $100,482.02 and
    $39,570.66, respectively. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[208]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Shtaif does not seriously
    challenge this finding on appeal, limiting his submissions to observing the
    respondents had pleaded misappropriation, not conspiracy, in respect of the
    garnished funds. On his part, Roberts argues: (i) the respondents’ pleading of
    conspiracy was too vague; (ii) Midland was not entitled to the return of the
    funds, in any event; and (iii) Roberts was lawfully entitled to the funds as
    reimbursement for pre-June 21, 2006 expenses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[209]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>The respondents concede they
    pled misappropriation, not conspiracy. However, they point out that much of the
    evidence about a conspiracy only came to light at trial because Roberts failed
    to produce his complete files on the issue before trial. They submit Shtaif’s
    and Roberts’s use of the Magellan promissory notes to obtain the monies in the
    two accounts was a live issue at trial. </span></p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[210]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>I would not give effect to
    this ground of appeal. Shtaif and Roberts fully responded to the issue at trial,
    and the trial judge granted the respondents leave to amend their pleading after
    closing submissions to advance their claim to recover the Magellan funds in the
    Faskens and TD accounts. There was no unfairness in the trial judge ultimately
    grounding liability in conspiracy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[211]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>As to the remainder of
    Roberts’s submission, the trial judge dealt fully with the issues at paras. 1063-1069
    of her reasons. At para. 1063, she stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The evidence is clear that in 2007, Roberts and Shtaif
    recovered money from Magellan using the secured demand promissory notes dated
    June 23, 2006 they had given themselves on June 21, 2006. They did not tell
    Shnaider and Shyfrin that they knew there were funds to Magellan's credit at
    Fasken's and the TD Bank, that they had given themselves the notes, that they
    were suing Magellan on those notes and taking other steps to collect on them.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span style='text-decoration:none'>The trial judge
    went on to conclude that (i) Shtaif and Roberts acted in concert; (ii) their conduct
    was unlawful; (iii) their conduct was directed toward the respondents; (iv)
    injury was likely; and (v) injury was caused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[212]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Ample evidence supported those
    findings. There is no basis for appellate intervention.</span></p>
  <h1>IX.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>FAILURE OF THE RESPONDENTS TO MITIGATE THEIR DAMAGES</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[213]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>Shtaif and Roberts also submit
    the trial judge erred in finding the respondents acted reasonably to mitigate
    their damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[214]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>I am not persuaded by the
    appellants’ arguments. The trial judge made two key findings on the mitigation
    issue: (i) the appellants lacked the financial wherewithal to buy-out the
    respondents’ position in Koll; and (ii) the respondents acted reasonably in
    their efforts to secure the ultimate sale of the Reef property. Again, ample
    evidence supported both findings, and the appellants have not identified a
    palpable and overriding error that would permit appellate intervention. </span></p>

    Roberts’s counterclaim seeking damages for the loss in value of his Koll shares
    based on the terms of the June 21, 2006 re-organization agreement and for
    breach of an employment contract with Koll. Roberts appeals both findings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='text-decoration:none'>[216]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='text-decoration:none'>His submissions on appeal
    simply repeat those he advanced at trial. In her reasons, the trial judge dealt
    at length with both of Roberts’s submissions. She made extensive findings of
    fact, many based on credibility assessments. Roberts has not demonstrated the
    trial judge committed any palpable and overriding error in reaching her
    conclusions. I therefore would dismiss his appeal in respect of his
    counterclaim.</span></p>

    the trial judge’s finding of liability in the amount of US$8.27 million for
    pre-June 21, 2006 conduct, and (iii) Roberts’s appeal of the dismissal of his

    Shtaif and Roberts of the findings of liability in respect of their post-June 21,
    2006 conduct, save and except for the liability in respect of their recoveries
    under the Magellan promissory notes. Consequently, I would vary para. 3 of the
    Judgment concerning Roberts by substituting the amount of US $8,309,570.66
    (US$8.27 million + $39,570.66), and vary para. 4 of the Judgment concerning
    Shtaif by substituting the amount of US $8,370,482.02 (US$8.27 million +

    trial judge devoted a considerable amount of time to inserting transcript
    references in her reasons for much of the evidence she reviewed. Such
    references can greatly facilitate appellate review. Unfortunately, the
    pagination of many of the transcripts filed by the parties on this appeal did
    not replicate the pagination used by the trial judge in her reasons. As a
    result, the benefit of her effort was lost. Where a trial judge undertakes
    including such detailed references in her reasons, appeal counsel must ensure
    the appeal transcripts employ the same pagination.</span></p>
