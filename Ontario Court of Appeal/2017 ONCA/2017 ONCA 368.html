  <p class=Endorsement align=left style='text-align:left'><b>By the Court</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Corporation of the City of St. Thomas (“the
    City”) and Chris Peck, the City’s Chief Building Official (“CBO”), appeal the
    application judge’s order declaring the Order to Remedy Unsafe Building, issued
    on December 3, 2015 (“the Order to Remedy”), by the CBO, null, void and
    inoperative.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent brings a cross-appeal to obtain
    an interim injunction preventing the appellants from demolishing its building
    located at 606-610 Talbot Street in St. Thomas, which was the subject of the
    Order to Remedy under appeal (“the Building”), and for a declaratory order that
    the Building is not “unsafe” as defined in the <i>Building Code Act</i> (“the
    Act”).  The application judge declined to deal with these claimed remedies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, we allow the appeal,
    dismiss the cross-appeal, and remit to another application judge the questions
    of whether the Building is unsafe and whether an interim injunction should
    issue.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Preliminary Issue</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties were asked to address whether the
    appeal and cross-appeal were moot.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The City issued a second Order to Remedy Unsafe
    Building, dated October 26, 2016, which the respondent has appealed to the
    Superior Court of Justice.  As with the first Order to Remedy, the respondent
    submits that the second order is null, void and ineffective because it lacks
    specificity. That appeal is pending.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes the position that there is
    still a live controversy between the parties as to the specificity of an Order to
    Remedy Unsafe Building under the Act, which would benefit from this court’s
    guidance.  The respondent maintains that the present appeal and cross-appeal
    are moot because they are superseded by the October 26, 2016 order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are of the view that the present appeal and
    cross-appeal are not moot.  The issues of whether the Order to Remedy lacks
    specificity, the Building is unsafe, and the availability of an interim
    injunction to prevent demolition, do not raise a hypothetical or abstract
    question but are still live issues between the parties; this court’s decision
    will therefore have a practical effect on the parties:  </span><span

    factual background to put the appeal and cross-appeal into their proper
    context.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Building is over 100 years old.  It was
    purchased by the respondent in 2003 with the plan of renovating it into a
    combination of commercial and residential apartments.  This plan has never
    progressed and the Building has sat vacant from at least the date it was
    purchased by the respondent. Since that time, the condition of the Building has
    deteriorated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The lengthy history of the parties’ dispute in
    relation to the Building dates back to at least 2008 when the CBO first issued
    an Order to Remedy on March 27, 2008, which, among other things, required the
    respondent to provide an engineer’s structural report and undertake certain
    remedial repairs.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent did not comply with the Order to
    Remedy or the subsequent orders issued by the CBO.  Instead, the respondent
    instigated injunction and other proceedings to stop the demolition of its
    Building.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was initially unsuccessful and
    the City was permitted by the July 15, 2008 order of Little J. to proceed with
    the demolition of the Building. Demolition commenced on July 21, 2008.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, two days later, on July 23, 2008, the
    respondent obtained a stay of the demolition order pending its appeal of Little
    J.’s order.  By then, the City had demolished part of the roof and removed some
    of the structural components of the Building.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent and its principal, David McGee, commenced
    an action against the appellants and others in July 2010 for wrongful
    demolition of the Building.  On December 21, 2011, Leitch J. dismissed the respondent’s
    action because the respondent was dissolved and was without legal capacity to
    commence the action.  The motion judge struck out Mr. McGee’s pleadings with
    leave to amend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent took no further remedial steps to
    stabilize and preserve the Building.  The respondent made several unsuccessful
    attempts to sell the Building.  Although the respondent applied for and was
    granted a building permit for shoring on January 12, 2015, no work was
    undertaken at that time.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In June 2015, a significant section of the
    Building’s second floor collapsed and on September 11, 2015, the roof partially
    collapsed.  The City engaged an engineering firm to inspect the Building and
    provide a written report with respect to its structural condition.  The CBO
    issued and served on the respondent an Order Prohibiting Occupancy dated
    September 15, 2015.  In response to the engineering report, also dated
    September 15, 2015, the CBO issued and served on the respondent an Emergency Order
    the following day on September 16, 2015, to which the engineering report was
    attached.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent engaged an engineering firm to
    prepare and deliver an inspection report which included a plan for hoarding and
    shoring to alleviate the danger posed by the instability of the Building, as
    well as waterproofing to avoid further deterioration.  The report was received
    on September 21, 2015. The respondent completed about 30% of the shoring, some
    of the hoarding, and none of the waterproofing, which were recommended by its
    own engineer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having determined that the immediate danger of
    collapse had been alleviated by the respondent’s temporary shoring and hoarding
    work, on November 5, 2015, the CBO lifted the Emergency Order and replaced it
    with an Order of the Property Standards Officer, which detailed additional work
    to be completed.  On December 3, 2015, the CBO issued the Order to Remedy
    Unsafe Building, which is the subject of this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent did not comply with the orders or
    complete any additional remedial work.  It did not appeal any of the orders but
    brought an application in March 2016 to have the Order to Remedy declared
    invalid, and to obtain interim injunctive relief, as well as a declaration that
    the Building was not unsafe.  In the alternative, the respondent requested
    leave to file a late appeal of the November 5, 2015 Order of the Property
    Standards Officer and the December 3, 2015 Order to Remedy.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Application Judge’s Decision</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge determined that the Order
    to Remedy was null, void and inoperative for the following reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>i.    It did not comply with the Act<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> because it was only served on the owner.  The application judge concluded that
    the Order to Remedy should have also been served on the respondent’s property
    manager and local supervisory agent, as “such other persons affected” by the
    Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>ii.   It lacked the specificity required under the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge concluded that, given her
    ruling with respect to the invalidity of the Order to Remedy, it was not
    necessary for her deal with the issue of injunctive relief.  Although not
    stated, presumably also because of her ruling, the application judge did not
    determine the factual issue of the Building’s structural integrity.    </span></p>

    the respondent’s property manager and local supervisory agent should be served
    with the Order to Remedy.  We agree with the appellants’ submission that the
    property manager and local supervisory agent were not in possession of the
    Building, but were at best the respondent’s agents for service.  The Building
    was vacant and there was an order that prohibited occupation.  Only the owner
    was in possession of the Building.  As a result, the CBO was not required to
    serve any other person.  There is no basis to suggest that the CBO acted
    unreasonably in the exercise of his discretion not to serve the respondent’s
    property manager and local supervisory agent.</span></p>

    determination that the Order to Remedy lacked specificity contrary to the Act. 
    The application judge did not provide any reasons or analysis for this
    conclusion.  She also mistakenly referred to s. 15.2(2) of the Act, which
    prescribes the contents of a Property Standards Order, rather than to s. 15.9 (4),
    which prescribes the contents of an Order to Remedy Unsafe Building.  Unfortunately,
    her lack of reasons and analysis does not permit us to conduct a meaningful
    appellate review.  As a result, no deference is owed to her decision and this
    court must consider this question afresh.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>, 2013 ONSC 2619, [2013] O.J. No. 2072, at para. 22, the court

    order that additional particulars be provided because it empowers a judge to
    take any action that the CBO may take:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>On an
    appeal, a judge may affirm or rescind the order or decision and take any other
    action that the judge considers the chief building official, registered code
    agency or inspector ought to take in accordance with this Act and the

    opinion for that of the official, agency or inspector.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning next to the prescribed specificity of
    the Order to Remedy, s. 15.9(4) of the Act stipulates that an Order to Remedy Unsafe
    Building should contain the following:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>An
    inspector who finds that a building is unsafe may make an order setting out the
    reasons why the building is unsafe and the remedial steps necessary to render
    the building safe and may require the order to be carried out within the time
    specified in the order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, we are of the view that the
    Order to Remedy complies with s. 15.9(4) of the Act in that it contains
    sufficient particularity to enable the respondent to know the case it had to
    meet and the deficiencies that had to be remedied.  In particular, the Order to
    Remedy specifies the areas and items in the Building that comprise the alleged serious,
    unsafe conditions requiring remediation, including the collapsed and rotten
    sections of floors and split structural beams that were also noted by the
    respondent’s own engineer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, when the Order to Remedy is viewed in
    the context of the long history between the parties, the lengthy correspondence
    and the detailed engineering reports that the parties exchanged, there can be
    no doubt that the respondent knew the case it had to meet and the repairs that
    were necessary to stabilize the Building.  Moreover, the respondent applied for
    a building permit to carry out repairs and its own engineer recommended certain
    remedial measures that corresponded with those required by the Order to Remedy. 
    The respondent completed some but not all of the necessary repairs.  The
    respondent did not complete all of the shoring and hoarding work required nor
    any of the waterproofing recommended by its own engineer.  This was not due to
    the respondent’s lack of understanding of what was required, but because of an
    admitted lack of funds to complete the repairs.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before leaving the issue of specificity, we make
    the following general recommendation for the future.  Given that an Order to Remedy
    Unsafe Building under the Act is necessarily fact-specific to the particular
    building or property for which the order is issued, it is not possible to make general,
    practical suggestions about the level of specificity required for such an
    order.  However, as appellants’ counsel conceded, if the CBO already has an
    engineering report, it would be helpful to attach it to the order requiring
    remediation, if it has not already been delivered to the person receiving the
    order (as it was in the present case).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By this recommendation, we are not suggesting
    that the CBO must obtain an engineering report before issuing an Order to Remedy
    Unsafe Building under the Act.  Nor is it fatal to the validity of such an
    order if the CBO does not have or does not attach an engineering report.  Certainly,
    for the protection of the public, the CBO must have the flexibility to issue such
    orders to deal with all kinds of situations without first incurring the delay
    and expense of an engineering report.  Moreover, it is also within the CBO’s
    discretion to require the person receiving the order to obtain an engineering
    report: </span><em>Ottawa</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 22.</span></p>
