  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentence imposed on April 29, 2016 by
    Justice Robert L. Maranger of the Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is a Crown appeal against sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was a long-time distributor of
    cocaine for a criminal organization. He was charged with offences committed in
    2012-2013, but admitted on wiretaps that he had been trafficking in cocaine as
    a distributor for an organized crime gang for over ten years and that he had also
    acted as an enforcer. Following his arrest in October 2013, he was released on
    bail. In February 2015, he was re-arrested for numerous breaches of
    recognizance and for possession of 17 oxycodone pills for which he had no
    prescription. His bail was revoked pursuant to s. 524(4) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span lang=EN-US> and he remained in custody until his sentencing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He pleaded guilty in May 2015 but was not
    sentenced until April 2016. He served one year, 69 days in pre-sentence
    custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After his guilty plea, the respondent was
    sentenced to seven years and 69 days imprisonment, broken down as follows: five
    years for conspiracy to traffic cocaine, five years to be served concurrently
    for trafficking in cocaine, two years and 69 days to be served consecutively
    for committing an indictable offence for the benefit of a criminal
    organization, one year to be served concurrently for possession of oxycodone
    and one year on each of the seven counts for breach of recognizance, to be
    served concurrently. The sentencing judge gave 1:1 credit for pre-sentence
    custody in accordance with ss. 719(3) and (3.1) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-US>. He applied the credit to the sentence for the criminal
    organization offence, thereby reducing it to under two years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown raises three arguments on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the Crown says that the sentencing judge
    erred in applying pre-sentence custody credit to the sentence for the criminal
    organization offence rather than to one of the other sentences. Pursuant to s.
    743.6(1.2) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>, the court is
    presumptively required to delay parole to one half of the sentence or ten
    years, whichever is less, for an offender receiving a sentence of imprisonment
    of two years or more on conviction of an offence for the benefit of a criminal
    organization. Also the sentence is to be served consecutive to any other
    sentence imposed: </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>, s. 467.14. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown submits that the sentencing judge’s
    approach, which reduced the length of the sentence for the criminal
    organization offence to under two years, had the effect of avoiding the
    statutory consequence regarding parole eligibility and therefore undermined the
    intended effect of this section, which is to enhance punishment for offences
    involving criminal organizations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not accept this submission. While it is
    clear that the intent of the quoted provisions is to enhance the severity of
    sentences imposed for an offence involving criminal organizations, there is
    nothing in the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US> that prohibits a
    judge from applying the pre-sentence custody in the manner that was done in
    this case. Furthermore, the Crown acknowledged in oral argument that, as
    submitted by counsel for the respondent, because of the total length of the
    sentence imposed in this case, the appellant’s parole eligibility will not be
    affected by the approach taken by the sentencing judge. Although he did not say
    so, this consequence may well have informed his decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the Crown asserts that the sentencing
    judge erred in making the breach of recognizance and possession of oxycodone
    sentences concurrent to the other sentences when the respondent committed these
    offences 16 months after his initial arrest, and when there was no nexus
    between the two sets of offences. While the sentencing judge was entitled to
    impose concurrent sentences after applying the totality principle, he did not
    advert to totality in his reasons for sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We agree that in the normal course, the sentence
    for the breaches and possession of oxycodone would be consecutive to the other
    sentences because they were entirely separate offences committed later in time,
    and constituted breaches of his release terms. However, it is clear from a
    review of the entire sentencing reasons as well as the sentences imposed on
    other members caught in the same police project that the sentencing judge
    imposed a sentence that in total accorded with his view of what was appropriate
    in all the circumstances. Furthermore, we were told that the respondent spent
    11 months in pre-sentence custody following his guilty plea because of the
    unavailability of the court. That custody could only be credited on a 1:1
    basis. This factor may also have influenced the sentencing judge’s decision to
    make the sentence concurrent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the Crown says that the sentence for
    conspiracy to traffic in cocaine and trafficking in cocaine was unfit as it was
    outside the proper range for the quantity of cocaine and level of involvement
    of the appellant.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>At sentencing, the Crown asked for a sentence at the
    top end of the range which it submitted was 8-14 years. The appellant asked for
    5 years, which he stated was the low end of the range, which he argued was 5-13
    years. The cases cited by the parties include: </span><em>R. v. Battista</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2011 ONSC 6394; </span><em>R. v. Bryan</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2011
    ONCA 273; </span><em>R. v. Majnoon</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2009 ONCA 876, 257
    O.A.C. 108, leave to appeal refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 288; <i>R. v. Nero</i>,
    2008 ONCA 622; </span><em>R. v. Muise</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2008 ONCA 665; </span><em>R.
    v. Bajada</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>(2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 255 (C.A.); </span><em>R.
    v. Feeney</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2015 ONSC 3218; </span><em>R. v. Chaves</em><span
lang=EN-US>, [2013] O.J. No. 5423 (C.J.). The sentencing judge then imposed the
    five year sentence, as part of the total sentence of seven years, 69 days. This
    court was apprised of two other sentences imposed on two offenders charged in
    the same police investigation, one by the same judge, of eight years each based
    on joint submissions in </span><em>R. v. Perron</em><span lang=EN-US>, (11
    October 2016), Ottawa, 13/30422 (S.C.) and </span><em>R. v. Gheorghevici</em><span
lang=EN-US>. Although this was not a joint submission, the trial judge referred
    to the sentence imposed in </span><em>Gheorghevici</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>and it is apparent he considered the parity principle when imposing
    this sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Crown that the case law supports the submission that
    eight years is toward the low-end of the accepted range for conspiracy to
    traffic in cocaine for mid-level dealers trafficking in quantities that include
    the kilogram level. While a very heavy sentence was warranted in this case, we
    cannot say that it is an error of law beyond the discretion of the trial judge
    to have imposed five years as part of a total sentence following a guilty plea
    and that is in accord with other sentences to which the parity principle
    applies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is
    dismissed.</p>
