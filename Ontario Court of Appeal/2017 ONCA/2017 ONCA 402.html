  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A long-serving McDonald’s restaurant manager was
    dismissed from her position without notice or payment of her statutory
    entitlements under the </span><em>Employment Standards Act</em><i><span
lang=EN-US>, 2000</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, S.O. 2000, c. 41 (the “Act”).</span></p>

    She was awarded damages representing 20 months’ compensation in lieu of notice,
    inclusive of statutory severance under the Act.     </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal raises, among other things, several important
    questions about what income the employee received during the notice period must
    be deducted from the damages award.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Esther Brake (“Ms. Brake” or the “Respondent”)
    worked at various McDonald’s restaurants for a total of more than 25 years. 
    For a significant part of that time, she was employed on a full-time basis by
    PJ-M2R Restaurant Inc. (“PJ-M2R” or the “Appellant”).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>PJ-M2R is a McDonald’s franchise holding company
    that owns several McDonald’s restaurants in the Ottawa area.  Perry McKenna and
    Jo-Ann McKenna own and operate PJ-M2R.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On August 2, 2012, Ms. Brake was working for
    PJ-M2R as a Restaurant Manager, a position that she had held for a number of
    years.  Mr. McKenna told Ms. Brake that she had to accept a demotion to First
    Assistant or she would be fired.  Ms. Brake refused to take the new position, as
    she felt that the position would be embarrassing and humiliating for her.  Her
    employment was then terminated.  At that time, Ms. Brake was 62 years of age. 
    She is now 66.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Brake sued PJ-M2R for wrongful dismissal. 
    PJ-M2R defended on the basis that she had failed to meet the requisite
    standards and, therefore, it had just cause to dismiss her.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that as of August 2, 2012,
    Ms. Brake had the equivalent of 20 years of employment with PJ-M2R.  He further
    found that she had been wrongfully dismissed and that an appropriate notice
    period was 20 months, inclusive of statutory severance as required by the Act.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By judgment dated March 14, 2016 (the
    “Judgment”), Ms. Brake was awarded $104,499.33, plus pre-judgment interest and
    costs.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>PJ-M2R appeals.  Its position on appeal is that:
    Ms. Brake was not wrongfully terminated; Ms. Brake’s refusal to accept the
    position as a First Assistant amounted to a failure to mitigate, thereby
    disentitling her to damages; the trial judge erred in setting a notice period
    of 20 months; and, the trial judge failed to properly account for income that
    Ms. Brake earned during the notice period.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The following recitation of the facts draws
    heavily from the trial judge’s reasons, including his findings of fact at paras.
    4(a) – (v).    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Brake started working at McDonald’s
    restaurants in 1986 in Corner Brook, Newfoundland.  In 1999, she moved to
    Ottawa and began working for PJ-M2R in its McDonald’s restaurants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the commencement of Ms. Brake’s employment
    with PJ-M2R, she received a letter from Mr. McKenna (the “Credit Letter”) that
    reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>This letter is to confirm Esther Brake length
    of service credit.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Esther joined us in July of 1999. She worked
    for 13 years in Corner Brook prior to joining PJ-M2R Restaurants.  50% of her
    service time will be credited towards full time benefits.  This means that she
    will be credited with 7 years of Full Time service as of 1999.</span></p>

    in a variety of capacities.  In 2004, she was promoted to the position of
    Restaurant Manager at one of PJ-M2R’s restaurants.  In 2008, she was
    transferred to manage PJ-M2R’s Kanata restaurant.  Her duties included managing
    another of PJ-M2R’s McDonald’s restaurants that was located in a nearby
    Wal-Mart.  In November of 2011, Ms. Brake was assigned exclusively to the
    Wal-Mart location.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From 2000-2010, Ms. Brake received an overall
    rating of “excellent” or better in all of her annual evaluations.  In his
    reasons, the trial judge included many representative excerpts from Ms. Brake’s
    various performance reviews over that period.  Some of those excerpts are set
    out below.</span></p>

    Kanata and Wal-Mart locations, she was rated as “excellent” in the various
    performance metrics, including Sales, “Quality/Service/Cleanliness” and “People
    and Profit”.  Her evaluation included the following comments: “Congratulations
    on your outstanding Crew Commitment Survey result of 97%.  That was the best
    score ever achieved for my company.  I believe it’s a direct result of your
    influence on the management team and some of the key crew people.”     </span></p>

    showed a minor decline in performance.  Mr. McKenna’s written comments were
    mixed.  They included a recommendation that Ms. Brake develop routines to
    improve follow-up but also a comment that her “work ethics, high standards,
    pride, and job knowledge” were “exceptional”. </span></p>

    “excellent” rating.  However, she was given a rating of “satisfactory” for the
    second half of that year.  Comments in her review for the first half of 2010
    include: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Esther, this is the best start to a new year
    I’ve ever seen you put together.  You have the store running the best I’ve
    seen.  Your CSO scores are below the national and regional average and way
    ahead of last year….  Also for the first time, both the McDonald’s and PJ-M2R
    scorecards are outstanding.  </span></p>

    metric that stands for “Customer Service Opportunities”.  It is expressed as a

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In November 2011, Ms. Brake received her first truly
    negative performance review since her promotion to Restaurant Manager in 2004. 
    The trial judge accepted her evidence that she was “dumbfounded” and
    “shocked”.  During the review, Mr. McKenna told Ms. Brake that she would be
    transferred to the Wal-Mart location.  At trial, Mr. McKenna explained that his
    decision to transfer her was an attempt to provide an opportunity for Ms. Brake
    to improve her performance.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge accepted Ms. Brake’s evidence
    that the Wal-Mart location was more difficult to manage because there was high
    staff turnover and less staffing, which meant the manager on duty was expected
    to cook, serve customers, and keep the restaurant clean.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Wal-Mart location had been “trending badly” since
    at least April 2011.  According to McDonald’s corporate documentation, that
    location had failed 8 out of 12 customer service opportunities that year.  It
    ranked 1,410 out of 1,437 McDonald’s restaurants in Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. McKenna knew the Wal-Mart location was
    struggling and that for Ms. Brake to succeed she would have to first “turn that

    the end of November 2011.  She says it is undisputed that she worked 12-hour
    days, 7 days a week from November 2011 to April 2012 and never asked for

    review meeting.  She was rated as “needs improvement” and told that because of
    her performance, she would be placed in McDonald’s progressive discipline
    program, known as the Goals Achievement Process (“GAP”).  The GAP document that
    she was given said that she had been placed in the program because her
    performance had declined to an “unsatisfactory level”.  The program gave Ms.
    Brake up to 90 days to achieve goals on which she and the Appellant were to agree.  </span></p>

    not implemented in accordance with its terms, either in letter or spirit.  He found
    that the thresholds that Ms. Brake was ordered to meet were arbitrary and
    unfair.  He gave, as an example, the Appellant’s use of the CSO scores.  For
    example, Ms. Brake was required to achieve a 0% CSO score at the Wal-Mart
    location at each of the 30, 60 and 90-day GAP evaluation periods.  The Wal-Mart
    location had historically “trended” at a 35% CSO score.  </span></p>

    outstanding scores according to McDonald’s own corporate standards, with a CSO
    of 0% and a QSC score of 90% or higher. She did not achieve the third goal, her
    “labour” goal, but missed it by a small margin. As with the CSO metric, a
    perfect labour score would be 0%.  Ms. Brake’s “goal” was 19.6%, and her actual
    result was 22.7%.</span></p>

    as a Restaurant Manager but the benefits would have been meaningfully inferior.  </span></p>

    that she was embarrassed and humiliated by the proposed demotion to First Assistant
    because she would be reporting to people whom she had trained and supervised,
    and those people were younger and less experienced than she was.  She left the

    fact, summarized above.  He gave detailed reasons for his findings and included
    quotations from documents made at the relevant times.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He then set out the legal principles that govern
    employment contracts, constructive dismissal, and the determination of a reasonable
    notice period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that, while “probably not
    a perfect employee in every respect”, Ms. Brake “was an overall competent
    manager with a long track record of successful contribution at the standard
    expected of her position. The performance appraisals filed over a considerable
    timespan can lead to no other conclusion.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He said that there was some evidence that Ms.
    Brake had “run into some difficulty” in late 2011 and into 2012.  He noted that
    this period could not be looked at in isolation, given Ms. Brake’s lengthy
    history of effective contribution to the Appellant. The trial judge concluded
    that the difficulties did not amount to anything close to gross or serious
    incompetence and stressed that, by the end of the GAP program, Ms. Brake had
    met the Appellant’s “new and improved” standards: “She was trending upward at
    an extraordinary degree when the decision to demote her was put on the table.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He further found that, taken at their highest
    and in aggregate, the complaints about Ms. Brake’s performance, as set out by
    the Appellant, did not amount to cause for dismissal:  “There was far more right
    about her performance than wrong with it.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also found that Ms. Brake had
    not been given a clear and reasonable opportunity to correct the issues that
    the Appellant had with her employment performance.  He noted that she had been
    transferred to a failing restaurant and was expected to turn it around and
    perform to standards that exceeded any that had been expected of her in the
    past.  He reiterated his findings that the GAP program, as implemented by the Appellant,
    was arbitrary and unfair and held Ms. Brake to goals that were more onerous
    than usual and in excess of those set by McDonald’s generally.  He concluded
    that Ms. Brake had been set up to fail from the beginning of the GAP program,
    pointing out that, although Ms. Brake ultimately met the onerous goals set for
    her, that was not enough for the Appellant.  Instead, it told her that she
    could take a demotion to First Assistant or leave.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the Appellant had
    made a substantial and fundamental change to Ms. Brake’s employment contract
    and, in so doing, constructively dismissed her without cause.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge noted that Ms. Brake was 62
    years of age at the time she was constructively dismissed and that she had
    worked for McDonald’s in some capacity for the majority of her working life. 
    He found that she had effectively worked for the Appellant for 20 of those
    years.  He noted that she had little in the way of formal education and that
    she had risen to a management position through perseverance and hard work.  Despite
    Ms. Brake’s reasonable best efforts, she had been unable to secure a reasonably
    comparable managerial position since her dismissal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After considering Ms. Brake’s age, the length
    and nature of her employment, the manner in which she had been dismissed, the
    low likelihood that she would ever again attain a similar managerial position,
    and the impact on her of being unjustly dismissed in the context of her
    character, reputation and circumstances, the trial judge found that a fair
    compensatory notice period was 20 months, inclusive of any statutory severance required
    by the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He then awarded damages equivalent to her
    remuneration over a 20-month time period, without deduction for income she
    received during that period.  The 20 months of compensation amounted to
    $104,499.53.  It was based on an annual salary of $53,000, a $6,000 car
    allowance, $1,307.76 for a cell phone and $2,391.84 in miscellaneous health
    benefits.      </span></p>

    evidence that she was “dumbfounded” and “shocked” when she received a negative
    review in November of 2011.  How can that be, asks the Appellant, when Ms.

    applied the legal principles in light of those findings.  The route by which he
    found that Ms. Brake’s employment had been wrongfully terminated is abundantly
    clear.  So, too, is his reasoning on the other legal issues that he decided. 
    There is no impediment either to the Appellant’s ability to mount its appeal or

    that the trial judge erred in accepting Ms. Brake’s evidence that she was
    dumbfounded when she got a negative performance review in November of 2011. 
    The trial judge was uniquely positioned to make such a finding.  He heard the
    parties and their witnesses and he had a full documentary record in front of
    him.  In Ms. Brake’s performance reviews from 2000-2010, she had received an
    overall rating of “excellent”.  It will be recalled that Ms. Brake’s review for
    the first half of 2010 included this comment:</span></p>

    I’ve ever seen you put together.  You have the store running the best I’ve

    employee consents or acquiesces in it, the change is not a unilateral act and
    will not constitute a breach.  To qualify as a breach, the change must also be
    detrimental to the employee.  Second, once it has been objectively established

    On the findings of the trial judge, there can be no doubt that it did.  The
    demotion was unilateral – Ms. Brake did not consent or acquiesce to it and
    there was no suggestion that either an express or implied term in the
    employment contract authorized the change in position.  Further, the demotion
    would have been detrimental to Ms. Brake if for no other reason than that her
    benefits would have been “meaningfully inferior”.   </span></p>

    the trial judge explained, Ms. Brake had a lengthy history of effective

    2008 SCC 20, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 661, at para. 30, can be summarized as follows. 
    Where an employer offers an employee a chance to mitigate damages by accepting
    a different position, the central issue is whether a reasonable person in the
    employee’s position would have accepted the offer.  This is an objective
    standard, on which the employer bears the burden of proof: </span><em>Evans</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 35.  The employee is not obliged to mitigate by working
    in an atmosphere of hostility, embarrassment or humiliation.  The non-tangible
    elements of the situation, including work atmosphere, stigma and loss of
    dignity, as well as the tangible elements, such as the nature and conditions of
    employment, must be considered in determining whether the objective standard
    has been met. </span></p>

    accept the demotion and continue working for PJ-M2R.  He noted that he had
    heard from many witnesses and gotten a real sense of the culture at PJ-M2R and
    how Ms. Brake fit into it.  He described the evidence given by some witnesses
    on behalf of PJ-M2R as being “downright insulting to Ms. Brake and her
    personality and abilities”.  He concluded that it was “perfectly
    understandable” that Ms. Brake would have found working under a young man whom
    she had trained to be embarrassing or even humiliating.  He concluded that Ms.
    Brake could not have been expected to continue with PJ-M2R “given the way they
    had treated her”.</span></p>

    McDonald’s prior to 1999, that work was “in no way connected to the Appellant”. 
    The Appellant says that it recognized Ms. Brake’s prior service with other McDonald’s

    the associated value that she brought to PJ-M2R, the Credit Letter was the
    Appellant’s acknowledgment that it credited her with having 7 years of

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(v)  Ms. Brake had long had another job at Sobey’s
    as a cashier, a fact that was always known to the [Appellant]. After August
    2012 she increased her hours at Sobey’s. In addition, Ms. Brake made other
    efforts to mitigate her damages. From October 2012 until mid-January 2013, she
    worked 30-36 hours per week at Tim Horton’s. Her hourly wage was $11.25. I
    accept Ms. Brake’s testimony that she attempted to start a babysitting service
    and cleaning service. She made phone calls, put up posters and posted an
    advertisement for both businesses on Kijiji. I further accept that by January
    2013, Ms. Brake realized that the businesses were not working and that she
    needed to find another source of income. Accordingly, she applied for several
    positions including as a McDonald’s mystery shopper, store manager and front
    store supervisor at Shopper’s Drug Mart, overnight supervisor at Home Depot,
    part-time cashier at IKEA, store manager at Mark’s Work Warehouse, supervisor
    at Costco, assistant store Manager at Loblaws, store manager at Dollarama and
    various other positions at Bed, Bath and Beyond, Swiss Chalet, LCBO and Target.
    Ms. Brake has not been offered a management position with any company since her
    termination. In March 2013, Ms. Brake accepted a position as a cashier at Home
    Depot. She works approximately 35-38 hours per week and earns a wage of $12.50

    obtain other employment”: </span><em>Michaels v. Red Deer College</em><span
lang=EN-US>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 324, at p. 331.  A terminated employee is entitled

    the damages award was inclusive of Ms. Brake’s statutory entitlements.  Thus,

    action in which he sought damages for wrongful dismissal and to recover the
    balance of his statutory entitlements.  He then sought summary judgment for
    payment of the balance of his statutory entitlements on the basis that such an amount
    was not subject to mitigation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span

    when such entitlements are obtained through the administrative route, they are
    not subject to mitigation (at para. 21).  He then summarized, at para. 22, the
    argument of the Director, who had intervened, as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The [Act] benefits are minimum entitlements and may not be
    reduced whether sought in an action or by the administrative route.  The [Act]
    entitlements are not damages.  They are not linked to any actual loss suffered
    by the employee, but are payable in any event.  They are to be paid “promptly”,
    a legislative indication that the employer is not entitled to wait and see if
    the employee becomes re-employed.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At para. 23,
    Lane J. stated that he agreed with the Director’s position and went on to
    further explain:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Act] entitlements are not linked, as damages are, to the
    criteria established in <i>Bardal</i> such as the age of the employee, the
    likely length of time to find another position, the actual finding of another
    position etc. They are payable in any event. In my view, it is illogical to
    suppose that the Legislature intended that such payments would become ‘damages’
    if sought in an action, but not when sought administratively. <u>They are
    minimum sums to be paid by the employer and subjecting them to reduction by reason
    of sums received from others removes their character as minimum.</u> Their

lang=EN-US>As I have explained, employment income that Ms. Brake earned during

    that basis, I would exclude three amounts of income: (1) income from Sobey’s for

    Brake’s statutory entitlement period nor does it permit the court to determine
    what part of the 2013 Sobey’s income was received outside of that period. 
    While those determinations should have been made at trial, in this case, it is
    of no moment as I would not treat any of the Sobey’s income as mitigation

    There is no finding as to when in 2013 Ms. Brake earned that income.  Bearing
    in mind the Appellant’s onus to demonstrate what losses were avoided, I am not

    “long” had another job at Sobey’s; she made salads for Sobey’s and did not act
    as a cashier; and Mr. McKenna discovered only in June of 2012 that Ms. Brake

    2004 because she wasn’t earning enough money working for PJ-M2R to provide for
    herself and her son and to also pay for the costs of her divorce.  She
    testified that Mr. McKenna was aware that she was working at Sobey’s but never

    salary.  In light of those losses, she told Mr. McKenna in January of 2012 that
    she would look for a part-time job and he said “do whatever you want to do”. 
    When a friend approached Ms. Brake about working at Sobey’s, she took the
    position because she believed her job with the Appellant was in jeopardy and
    she needed to have some money in the bank in case she got fired.</span></p>

    exactly how the trial judge phrased the first sentence of para. 4(v), I see no
    palpable and overriding error in it.  The essential point to be taken from that
    sentence is that, while employed by the Appellant and to the Appellant’s
    knowledge, Ms. Brake supplemented her income by working part-time at Sobeys.</span></p>

    case, the amounts received from Sobey’s do not rise to such a level that her
    work at Sobey’s can be seen as a substitute for her work at PJ-M2R.  I leave
    for another day the question as to when supplementary employment income rises
    to a level that it (or a portion of it) should be considered as a substitute
    for the amounts that would have been earned under the original contract and,
    accordingly, be treated as deductible mitigation income.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I would not deduct the sums that

lang=EN-US>As I have already mentioned, the court sought additional written
    submissions from the parties after the oral hearing of the appeal.  In Ms.
    Brake’s additional submissions, she argued that the employee’s right to receive
    severance benefits under the Act is separate from the right to damages at
    common law.  Accordingly, she contended, the trial judge erred in combining the
    two amounts.  She asked that she be granted 34 weeks of severance pay in
    addition to compensation for 20 months’ notice at common law.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>Where the employer dismisses the employee and fails to give the
    employee the benefits to which the employee is entitled under the Act, the
    employee may claim both those benefits and common law damages in a single civil
    action, so long as there is no double recovery.  This approach follows from </span><em>Stevens</em><span

    by the Act.  </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I fully concur
    with the result reached by Gillese J.A., and with her excellent reasons.
    However, with respect to the income the respondent earns as a cashier at Home
    Depot, in my view, the trial judge was entitled to make the following finding: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The cashier position she occupies now at Home Depot is so
    substantially inferior to the managerial position she held with the Defendant
    that the former does not diminish the loss of the latter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was on that
    basis that the trial judge declined to deduct the Home Depot income that the
    respondent earned during the notice period from her damages for wrongful
    dismissal. I would uphold that decision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    found that the respondent made reasonable best efforts to find a managerial
    position reasonably comparable to the one she held with the appellant. Having
    been unable to do so, the respondent accepted a non-managerial job as a cashier
    at a much lower salary, because she needed to earn money.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A wrongfully
    dismissed employee has a duty to try to mitigate her damages by making
    reasonable best efforts to obtain a position that is reasonably comparable in
    salary and responsibility to the one from which she was wrongfully dismissed.
    If she is able to secure such a position, her earnings are deducted from her
    damages as mitigation.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> If she turns down such a position, or fails to make reasonable best efforts,
    then the amount she could have earned at a comparable position is similarly
    deducted from her damages, based on a failure to meet the duty to mitigate. But
    if she can only find a position that is not comparable in either salary or
    responsibility, she is entitled to turn it down, and if she does, the amount
    she could have earned is not deducted from her damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows, in
    my view, that where a wrongfully dismissed employee is effectively forced to
    accept a much inferior position because no comparable position is available,
    the amount she earns in that position is not mitigation of damages and need not
    be deducted from the amount the employer must pay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is always up
    to the trial judge to determine if the employee has met her duty to mitigate.
    When a wrongfully dismissed employee accepts new employment during the notice
    period, the question of whether or not to deduct those earnings depends on the
    trial judge’s assessment of mitigation. If the trial judge finds that the new
    job is comparable to the old one, the earnings should be deducted as mitigation
    of damages. If the trial judge finds that the new job is vastly inferior to the
    old one, such that the employee would not be in breach of the duty to mitigate
    if she turned it down, the earnings should not be deducted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words,
    the trial judge decides whether a job that an employee takes or turns down,
    amounts to mitigation of damages. As my colleague states at para. 98, only
    monies that are received in mitigation of the loss are deducted from the
    damages award.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case,
    the employee was not an executive who could afford to live during the notice
    period without a salary. It was in her interest to try to obtain a comparable
    managerial position but she was not able to do so, and because she could not
    afford to earn nothing, she had to take the only job she could find. The trial
    judge determined that the job she found was in no way comparable to her
    managerial position with the appellant. As a result, it did not have the effect
    of mitigating the damages she suffered from her wrongful dismissal by the
    appellant employer and should not be deducted. </p>
