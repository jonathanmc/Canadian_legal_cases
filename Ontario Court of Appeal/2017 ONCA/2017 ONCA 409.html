  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard: May 17, 2017</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on June 17, 2013 by
    Justice D. Shaw of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual touching by Shaw J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice. He received a sentence of two years and six months
    imprisonment less 647 days credit for pre-sentence custody. The appellant
    appeals the conviction. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant stood trial for the sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant, his daughter. The complainant was 16 years old at the time of the offences. In early March, the complainant was drinking with her friends in the basement of the home that she, her father, and her younger stepsister lived in.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After her friends, other than I.F., left, the complainant continued to
    drink with the appellant, the appellant’s cousin, and Mr. F. on the main floor
    of the home.  The complainant became drunk and went upstairs to her bedroom to
    go to sleep leaving the appellant, the appellant’s cousin, and Mr. F. on the
    main floor of the home. A few minutes afterwards, the appellant went upstairs. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant had passed out, fully clothed, on her bed. She awoke to
    someone pulling down her pants and underwear. She kept her eyes closed as she
    was scared. She testified that she knew it was the appellant because she could
    feel the bristles from his facial hair when he placed his mouth on her
    genitalia. The assailant then proceeded to have sexual intercourse with her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the appellant did not return to continue the card game, his cousin
    went upstairs to check on him. The complainant testified that the sexual
    intercourse ended when the appellant’s cousin called out the appellant’s name
    just outside the bedroom door. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant got up, sneaked past the spare room, where she heard the
    appellant and the appellant’s cousin talking, and fled the home with Mr. F.
    They went to his home. The police were contacted the next day. The complainant
    gave a videotaped statement describing the incident to the Ontario provincial
    police on March 6, 2011. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown case was that the appellant had committed the sexual assault. The Crown led with testimony from the complainant, Mr. F., and the appellant's cousin. Crown counsel also adduced the evidence of J.S., the complainant's cousin who testified that the appellant had by way of Facebook message stated that he had &quot;snagged&quot; someone on the day of the incident (which meant that he had sex with someone). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence case was that the appellant did not commit the sexual assault. Defence counsel submitted that the complainant was intoxicated and that there was nothing to corroborate the complainant's evidence. Defence counsel also submitted that the complainant's evidence of the prickles that she felt on her genitalia during the incident meant the appellant could not have been the assailant since he shaved daily. Defence counsel also argued that the Facebook entries were not authored by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was found guilty of sexual touching and sexual assault.
    Pursuant to the principles in <em>Kienapple</em>, a conviction was entered on
    the charge of sexual touching and a stay was entered on the charge of sexual
    assault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advances four grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant contends that the trial judge applied different
    standards of scrutiny to the evidence of the complainant and the evidence of
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. The trial judge provided concrete
    reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence. He also identified, and
    addressed, inconsistencies in the evidence, including the complainant’s
    testimony. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to properly apply the W(D) principles in dealing with the evidence adduced by the Crown. In particular, the appellant submits that the trial judge did not critically analyze the complainant's evidence and merely accepted it. The main example cited by the appellant on this issue is the fact that only at the trial (and not in her statement to the police or in her testimony at the preliminary inquiry) did the complainant indicate that she knew that the appellant was the assailant because she could feel the prickles from his unshaven facial hair.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, we reject this submission, and especially so with respect to the
    trial judge’s treatment of the complainant’s evidence. The trial judge
    explicitly instructed himself on<em> W(D)</em> and cautioned that “a criminal
    trial is not a credibility contest where the trier of fact must choose whether
    to believe one side or the other.” He then carefully reviewed the evidence,
    including some of the complainant’s evidence that conflicted with the evidence
    of I.F. He moved through each of the three <em>W(D)</em> steps and reached a
    conclusion. There is nothing wrong in the trial judge’s analytic process in
    reaching that conclusion. On the facial hair issue, the complainant was asked a
    direct question at trial: “how do you know it was your Dad?” and she answered
    it. She was not asked this question when she made her statement to the police
    and the issue was barely touched on at the preliminary inquiry, in cross-examination
    at trial, and in the defence closing submissions at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant asserts that the trial judge failed to analyze critically
    the evidence pertaining to the Facebook messages. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. As the trial judge recognized, the Facebook messages were
    telling evidence against the appellant. The trial judge reasoned: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[125]      As Mr. [S] himself acknowledged, the Facebook
    conversations advising that Mr. [F] had been at the house would mean that the
    person writing the message would have to have been at Mr. [S’s] house to know
    that fact. This points to the messages having come from the house and again
    goes back to Mr. [S’s] suggestions that because it was not him chatting, it had
    to be either Ms. [K] or Ms. [C]. Both women said they were not using Mr. [S’s]
    Facebook account. It is unrealistic to conclude that either of these two women
    were pretending to be Mr. [S], hitting on [J.S.], as a self-described “hot old
    man” and chatting about snagging and having oral sex with a woman, and moreover,
    doing so while avoiding any notice of Mr. [S]. I cannot accept his explanation
    that they could have done so because he was careful to preserve their privacy
    while they were on the computer, avoiding looking at what they were doing. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[126]  … [I]t would fly in the face of reason to accept the
    explanation of Mr. [S] that someone else was writing on the Facebook page.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[128]  … I find the Facebook issue is significant in assessing
    Mr. [S’s] credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, this reasoning is fair and persuasive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the appellant argues that the trial judge failed to consider the
    absence of any medical or forensic evidence of a sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the evidence the trial judge accepted – especially the
    complainant’s testimony – was sufficient to ground a conviction. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed. </p>
