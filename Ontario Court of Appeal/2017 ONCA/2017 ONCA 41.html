  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>On February 20, 2005, Rossana Surujdeo was
    approaching her 36<sup>th</sup> birthday. On that day, she became quite sick.
    At about 9:45 p.m., she was taken by ambulance to the William Osler Health
    Centre, Brampton Memorial Campus (the “Hospital). She died the following
    morning at 7:20 a.m. An autopsy revealed Rossana died of myocarditis, an
    inflammation of heart muscle caused by a viral illness.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Rossana’s husband, the respondent Indernil
    Surujdeo, and her parents brought this negligence action against four of the
    treating physicians, the Hospital, Dr. J. Doe, and Nurse J. Doe. </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>By the time of trial, Rossana’s parents had
    discontinued their participation in the action. As well, the action was
    proceeding only against two of the physicians – the appellants Dr. Donald Louis
    Melady, an emergency physician, and Dr. Avrum Aron Soicher, a respirologist.</span><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:150%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>As described by the appellants, two of the
    central issues at trial were the Test Results and Causation Issues. The Test
    Results Issue concerned whether the standard of care required the appellant
    physicians to actively seek out the results of two laboratory tests – lactate
    and arterial blood gases. The Causation Issue concerned whether there was
    anything the appellants reasonably could have done to avoid Rossana’s death
    given the aggressive form of her viral myocarditis, the short amount of time in
    which to diagnose and treat her condition, and the lack of certain required
    treatment at the Hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>At the end of a 19-day trial, which included
    three days of deliberation, a jury found Drs. Melady and Soicher liable for
    damages in the amount of $600,000. The trial judge awarded the respondent costs
    totaling $450,000.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The appellants seek to set aside the
    judgment. They advance five main grounds of appeal, submitting the trial judge
    made the following errors:</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='
line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In respect of the Test Results Issue: (i) he
    permitted the respondent to conduct some written discovery of the appellants at
    the start of the trial; (ii) he limited the appellants’ ability to adduce
    evidence from their experts on the discovery answers; (iii) he limited the
    appellants’ ability to adduce evidence about a policy of the Hospital’s
    Department of Laboratory Medicine on the Communication of Critical Values; and
    (iv) he did not fairly charge the jury on the issue;</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='
line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>the legal instruction he gave the jury on the
    Causation Issue was flawed; as well, he gave an unbalanced charge on the issue;</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='
line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>he provided the jury with verdict questions
    that incorrectly stated the legal test for causation;</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>he gave an incorrect response to a question
    from the jury about the number of jurors required to agree with each answer to the
    verdict sheet questions; and</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='
line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>he refused to poll the jury at the
    appellants’ request.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss
    the appeal. Although the trial judge used incorrect language in the jury
    questions regarding causation, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
    resulted. In respect of the other grounds of appeal, I conclude the trial judge
    did not commit the errors alleged. </span></p>
  <h1 style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%'>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:150%'>THE TEST RESULTS ISSUE</span></h1>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Rossana died of myocarditis. The jury
    accepted the evidence of the respondent’s expert cardiologist that she had
    fulminant myocarditis. The clinical presentation of a patient with fulminant
    myocarditis is shock, a condition where decreased heart function causes
    inadequate blood flow to the organs.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Upon Rossana’s arrival at the Hospital, Dr.
    Melady diagnosed her as suffering from viral pericarditis. He ordered several
    tests, including a lactate and arterial blood gas, or ABG, test. </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Part of the respondent’s theory of liability
    at trial was that the results of those two tests showed Rossana was in shock,
    which should have prompted Dr. Melady to re-consider his initial diagnosis of
    pericarditis.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[11]<span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>There was no dispute the appellants did not
    see or seek out the results of the lactate and ABG tests. There also was no
    dispute the results of those tests were posted or published on the Hospital’s
    online Meditech platform. A significant issue at trial was whether the standard
    of care required the appellants to actively seek out those results. </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[12]<span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Some context is necessary to understand the
    decisions the trial judge made concerning the test results the appellants
    submit were in error. Below I set out brief chronologies of the treatment
    Rossana received at the Hospital and the emergence of the dispute about the
    Test Results Issue in the lead-up to the trial. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>On February 20, 2005 Rossana arrived at the
    Hospital’s emergency department at 9:41 p.m. Over the ensuing 10 hours, the
    appellants provided the primary medical care to her. </span></p>

    He diagnosed her with viral pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac around the
    heart caused by viral infection. At 10:40 p.m., he reassessed her. Shortly
    thereafter he ordered a lactate test. The Hospital’s laboratory received the
    order at 10:45 p.m. and a blood sample was taken at 11:10 p.m. The lab called
    the lactate test results to an Emergency Department clerk at 11:43 p.m., and
    the results were broadcast on the Meditech computer system at 11:45 p.m.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>Instead, these facts may be elicited by Dr. Melady and/or Dr.

    practical effect of the Consent Dismissal Order became a matter of dispute
    between the parties. Consequently, the appellants brought a motion asking the
    trial judge to determine the effect, if any, of the Consent Dismissal Order on
    the appellants’ ability to lead evidence regarding the laboratory testing
    results. The appellants indicated they wished to adduce evidence on whether
    they contemporaneously received the results of certain laboratory testing
    conducted by the Hospital. They submitted the determination of the issue might

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>On the first day of trial the trial judge
    dealt with the appellants’ motion regarding the Consent Dismissal Order. The
    appellants advised they wanted to testify about what they knew or did not know
    about the ordered test results. Respondent’s counsel made two objections.
    First, he contended the appellants’ pleading had not put in issue the delivery
    of test results to the appellants, so he had not examined exhaustively on the
    issue. As well, the appellants had not amended their pleading following the
    Consent Dismissal Order. Second, the Consent Dismissal Order estopped the
    appellants from giving such evidence because they would be pointing their
    fingers at the nurses and the Hospital for not doing their job in bringing the
    test results to the appellants’ attention. Respondent’s counsel informed the
    trial judge that on discovery the appellants had stated they did not have any
    concerns about the Hospital’s conduct. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The trial judge did not agree the Consent
    Dismissal Order estopped the appellants from giving such evidence. He stated
    respondent’s counsel may not have twigged “to the nuance” of appellants’
    counsel’s letter of April 4, 2012. In order to “give everybody a fair shake”
    and “make the playing field even”, the trial judge ordered the appellants to
    submit to further discovery on the Test Results Issue.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Following further discussions with counsel,
    the trial judge ordered the respondent to provide appellants’ counsel with a
    list of his discovery questions. That was done later on Day 1 of the trial. The
    trial judge ordered the appellants to provide written answers to those
    questions by the end of Day 3. Once delivered, the respondent accepted the
    written answers as adequate further discovery.</span></p>

    trial judge erred in ordering the further discovery. They contend the trial
    judge made the order on his own initiative without any motion by the
    respondent. The appellants recognize that pursuant to r. 48.04(1) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> the court can grant a party leave to continue discovery
    after setting an action down for trial. However, they submit the trial judge
    erred in granting leave because the respondent had not demonstrated a
    substantial or unexpected change in circumstances, as required by the
    jurisprudence under the rule. </span></p>

    appellants in their factum. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The trial judge did not raise the matter of
    further discovery on his own initiative. The respondent raised the matter in
    the context of the appellants’ motion concerning the effect of the Consent
    Dismissal Order. As noted above, the respondent objected to the appellants’
    request to adduce evidence regarding contemporaneous communication of test
    results in part because the respondent had not conducted discovery on the issue.
    The trial judge dealt with that objection by ordering further discovery. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The trial judge possessed the power to permit
    further discovery pursuant to r. 48.04(1) and his inherent powers to control
    the trial process. In exercising those powers, the trial judge considered the
    litigation history leading up to the discovery request and the relevance of the
    information sought on discovery, fairly balanced the interests of both parties,
    and crafted an order limited in both the scope and method of examination. The
    order caused no prejudice to the appellants. Accordingly, I see no error in the
    trial judge’s order.</span></p>

    generally how they learned about laboratory results; (iii) whether they were

    chief about his familiarity in 2005 with the Meditech system and generally how
    he found out about laboratory tests. However, respondent’s counsel objected to
    Dr. Soicher testifying about whether he believed he was aware of the lactate
    and ABG results at the time and, if he was, what he would have done. A
    discussion ensued in the absence of the jury. The trial judge ruled Dr. Soicher
    could testify as to his practice of noting test results and whether he noted
    Rossana’s lactate and ABG results. Appellants’ counsel stated: “I’m fine with
    that, Your Honour.” When the jury returned, Dr. Soicher answered those
    questions.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Prior to trial, the appellants served
    responding expert reports from two experts – Dr. David Boushy, an expert in
    emergency medicine, and Dr. Peter Liu, a cardiologist. Their reports responded
    to expert reports served by the respondent/plaintiff from Dr. Edwin Brankston,
    on the issue of emergency medical treatment, and Dr. David Fitchett, a
    cardiologist.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In their reports, Drs. Brankston and Fitchett
    opined it was the physician’s responsibility to obtain the results of the
    lactate and ABG tests as part of their continuing assessment of Rossana. In
    their reports delivered before trial, the appellants’ experts did not respond
    to those opinions; they did not opine on whether the failure to seek out those
    test results constituted a breach of the standard of care. The appellants’
    experts based their opinions on the assumption that neither appellant had seen
    the lactate or ABG test results.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>On Day 3 of the trial, the appellants
    delivered their responses to the written discovery questions the trial judge
    ordered. They then served short supplementary reports from both their experts.
    Dr. Boushy wrote that Dr. Melady would not have been expected or obligated to
    search out the test results and was entitled to expect hospital staff would put
    any results directly in the patient’s chart. Dr. Liu wrote that Dr. Soicher was
    entitled to rely on the hospital staff to put lab results in the patient’s
    chart and to bring markedly abnormal results to his attention. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The trial judge sustained the objection for
    two reasons: (i) before trial the respondents’ experts had squarely raised the
    issue in their reports, yet neither appellants’ expert had responded to that
    issue – the supplementary reports were “too little too late”; and (ii) both
    experts seemed “to point a finger at the nurses,” which was not permissible
    given the Consent Dismissal Order in favour of the Hospital. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>I disagree. It was a matter within the trial
    judge’s discretion whether to grant leave to permit the filing of supplementary
    expert reports beyond the timelines stipulated in the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> or to permit the appellants’ experts to testify on an issue not
    set out in their reports: rr. 53.03(3) and (4) and 53.08. In the present case,
    the appellants’ experts had not responded to the opinions the respondent’s
    experts initially gave on the issue. Their initial reports assumed the
    appellants were not aware of the test results, an assumption confirmed, not
    changed, by the appellants’ interrogatory responses. As well, their
    supplementary opinions were inconsistent with the consent release of the
    Hospital from the action. Given those circumstances, I see no error in the
    trial judge’s exercise of his discretion in denying leave. </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In any event, as the evidence of the
    appellants’ experts unfolded, much of their “supplementary” evidence found its
    way into the record: (i) Dr. Boushy testified in chief that the written
    interrogatory responses did not change his opinion that Dr. Melady had met the
    standard of care and that it was not necessary for Dr. Melady to follow up on
    the results of the lactate and ABG tests; and (ii) Dr. Liu testified in chief
    that the appellants’ trial evidence had not changed his opinion that Dr.
    Soicher had met the standard of care.</span></p>
  <h3>Limiting the re-examination of an
    appellants’ expert witness</h3>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In her re-examination of Dr. Boushy,
    appellants’ counsel asked whether Dr. Melady was required to seek out test
    results in the computer system. The trial judge did not permit Dr. Boushy to
    answer, ruling that “he didn’t touch that and that’s not the evidence. And you are
    then traveling into dangerous territory.” The appellants submit the trial judge
    erred in so ruling.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[56]<span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>I do not accept their submission. As noted,
    in chief Dr. Boushy testified it was not necessary for Dr. Melady to follow up
    on the lactate and ABG test results.  During cross-examination, Dr. Boushy was
    asked to assume those results were available for Dr. Melady to view on the
    computer system. Dr. Boushy replied he was not sure how the Meditech system
    worked, but repeated his view that Dr. Melady was not under an obligation to
    seek out those test results. Given that evidence, the re-examination question
    posed to Dr. Boushy was not a proper one since there was no uncertainty or
    confusion in his evidence on the point in cross that required clarification.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[57]<span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>I also would observe that, in his closing,
    appellants’ counsel referred the jury to Dr. Boushy’s position: “According to
    Dr. Boushy, it was not necessary for Dr. Melady to actively search out test
    results on Meditech.” The appellants’ position was put squarely before the jury
    for its consideration.</span></p>
  <h3>The appellants’ cross-examination
    of the respondent’s experts</h3>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Finally, the appellants submit the trial
    judge erred by preventing them from cross-examining the plaintiff’s expert, Dr.
    Brankston, on a hospital policy and the standard practice of physicians
    concerning the communication of test results.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[59]<span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The parties’ joint book of trial documents
    contained the policy of the Hospital’s Department of Laboratory Medicine on
    “Communication of Critical Values” (the “Policy”). The Policy defined “critical
    results” as “action level results that are potentially life threatening” and
    required their reporting “as soon as possible.” The Policy required “designated
    staff” to report critical results “to the physician/patient care area” which,
    in the case of a patient located in the emergency department, was the
    “emergency unit RN”.</span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Dr. Brankston did not review the Policy when
    preparing his reports. Indeed, none of the experts’ reports contained comments
    on the Policy. However, appellants’ counsel wanted to test Dr. Brankston’s
    opinion that Dr. Melady should have sought out the test results before he left
    the Hospital at the end of his shift by putting the Policy to him on cross. As
    well, appellant’s counsel wanted to ask him about “the relationship between
    nurses and doctors, that the doctors can rely on nurses to advise them of
    material developments with the patient.”  </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Respondent’s counsel objected, taking the
    position it would open up the issue of the nurses’ responsibility to bring test
    results to the physician’s attention, an issue the trial judge had ruled
    off-limits on the first day of the trial.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Appellants’ counsel provided the trial judge
    with specific questions he wished to put to Dr. Brankston on cross-examination.
    The trial judge only expressed concern about one – a question whether nurses
    would notify the physician of any material lab results. In the trial judge’s
    view, that would take the evidence into an area he had ruled was “not
    appropriately discovered on at this moment in time.” </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Appellants’ counsel then expressed his
    concern that at the end of the trial respondent’s counsel likely would tell the
    jury Dr. Melady should have gone and sought out those results either by
    checking them on Meditech or asking the nurses where they were. The trial judge
    stated respondent’s counsel would not be able to do that: “He is going to be
    able to say all we have heard is that they were available on Meditech.”
    Appellant’s counsel responded: “If that’s it, I am content. I am very content.”
    There the matter of cross-examining Dr. Brankston on the Policy and standard
    test result reporting practice was left.  </span></p>
  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>On cross-examination, Dr. Brankston admitted:
    (i) emergency room physicians may rely on nurses to notify them of material
    changes in a patient’s condition; (ii) it is reasonable for an emergency room
    physician to expect nurses will come to him if they have concerns about a
    patient; and (iii) it is reasonable for an emergency room physician to assume
    that if a nurse has not come to him to report a concern, no acute issue exists
    to which he needs to attend. </span></p>

    closing. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Though the appellants now characterize as
    errors the trial judge’s limitations on their cross-examination of Dr.
    Brankston, it is far from clear they maintained live objections on this issue
    following counsels’ exchange with the trial judge. The record strongly suggests
    a solution acceptable to both parties had been worked out with the trial judge.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Moreover, prior to trial the appellants had
    made the strategic decision to consent to letting the Hospital out of the
    action, including dismissing their cross-claim against the Hospital. That
    decision precluded the appellants from pointing a blaming finger at the
    Hospital and its nursing staff during the trial. Since the appellants’ motion
    on the first day of the trial, the trial judge attempted to deal with the
    practical consequences of the appellants’ strategic decision, policing the line
    dividing permissible examination and cross-examination of witnesses from impermissible
    finger pointing at a party who was not in the trial courtroom because of the
    Consent Dismissal Order. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Finally, the appellants submit the limits the
    trial judge placed on their ability to adduce evidence were compounded by three
    errors in his charge on the Test Results Issue. Specifically, they contend the
    trial judge (i) improperly commented on the state of the evidence regarding the
    issue, (ii) misstated the legal test on the standard of care and the
    respondent’s onus regarding proof of causation and (iii) gave an unbalanced

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Dealing with the first issue, the appellants
    submit the trial judge improperly invited the jury to conclude the doctors had
    failed to address the Test Results Issue when he stated: “The one piece in this
    puzzle which you might find has not been appropriately addressed or reconciled
    by the defendants is the fact, simply put, that neither doctor had the lactate
    and ABG test results and neither was aware of them…”</span></p>

    comment. A trial judge is entitled to express his own views of the facts or on
    the credibility of witnesses provided (i) he does not use such language as
    leads the jury to think that they must find the facts in the way he indicates
    and (ii) the charge does not deprive a party of a fair presentation of his case
    to the jury: <i>R. v. Ruddick</i> (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 421, [1980] O.J. No.

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In the present case, the trial judge
    repeatedly instructed the jury that they, not he, were the triers of the facts.
    He specifically stated that if he commented on the evidence, they were “in no
    way bound to follow my opinion insofar as the facts are concerned…if your views
    are at variance with mine, you must disregard my comments.” The trial judge also
    stated he would leave it to the jury to “determine on the basis of the expert
    evidence proffered whether [Dr. Melady’s failure to access the lactate and ABG
    results before he left the emergency room] was or was not relevant to
    [Rossana’s] diagnosis and the standard of care issue.” </span></p>

    the appellants of a fair presentation of their case on the Test Results Issue.
    Shortly before making the statement the trial judge recalled for the jury the
    comment of the appellants’ expert, Dr. Boushy, “that a physician would not be
    so obliged to look for such test results…” Immediately after making the
    statement, the trial judge stated: “[Y]ou have to choose between the positions

    the distinction between negligence and an error of professional judgment, he
    stated: “I would observe that if the erroneous diagnosis <i>might have been
    otherwise</i> had the physician availed himself of all relevant available
    information or the doctor was obliged to conduct additional or repeat tests, he
    cannot be heard to say that the original diagnosis was but an error in judgment”
    (emphasis added). The appellants submit the trial judge misstated the onus of
    proof by using the phrase “might have been otherwise”; the trial judge should
    have stated “likely should have changed the diagnosis.”</span></p>

    error in a trial judge’s jury instructions in the context of the entire charge
    and the trial as a whole. Appellate courts should not examine minute details of
    a jury instruction in isolation because it is the overall effect of the charge
    that matters: <i>R. v. Araya</i>, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para.

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Although the language appellants’ trial
    counsel proposed might have been preferable in the circumstances, the trial
    judge’s choice of words did not mislead the jury. As he said in response to the
    appellants’ objection: “[The jury has] to be satisfied on a balance of
    probabilities. I’ve only said that 15 times.” Indeed, the trial judge
    repeatedly instructed the jury the respondent bore the onus of proving a breach
    of the standard of care and causation on a balance of probabilities. Having
    regard to the charge in its entirety, the jury would have understood the law
    concerning the plaintiff’s onus: <i>Goodwin (Litigation guardian of) v. Olupona</i>,
    2013 ONCA 259, 305 O.A.C. 245, at para. 79. There could be no confusion on
    their   part.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Before us, the appellants advance an
    additional objection to this part of the charge – by referring to “all relevant
    available information” the trial judge misstated the law with respect to the
    standard of care. The proper question, they say, is whether “the physician
    failed to avail himself of information that he ought to have obtained.”</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>I see no error by the trial judge. First,
    this objection was not advanced at trial, an omission that weighs heavily
    against its consideration on appeal. Second, elsewhere in his charge the trial
    judge clearly instructed the jury on the meaning of the standard of care as
    applied to a medical practitioner, including the role of expert evidence in
    their assessment of whether the appellants’ conduct met the standard of care. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The appellants also submit the trial judge
    erred in his charge by devoting a disproportionate amount of time to the
    respondent’s evidence and position on the Test Results Issue, while failing to
    articulate that of the appellants.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Their submission is not borne out by a review
    of the charge as a whole. The trial judge placed before the jury the positions
    of both sides on each aspect of the standard of care issue, including the
    reasonableness of the appellants’ diagnoses. He specifically recalled for the
    jury the evidence of experts both parties called as to whether the appellants
    were obliged to look for the test results. I am satisfied the trial judge
    placed before the jury the appellants’ theory on all aspects of liability,
    including the test results, the related factual issues, and the appellant’s
    position concerning the testimony integral to those issues: <i>Brochu v. Pond</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 722 (C.A.), at para. 60.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The appellants submit the trial judge’s
    charge on the issue of causation was deficient in two ways. First, the trial
    judge devoted little time to the issue of causation, notwithstanding its
    importance. Second, the charge on causation was unbalanced, incomplete, and
    skewed in the respondent’s favour.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The adequacy of a jury charge on a particular
    issue is not assessed by comparing the number of words the trial judge devoted
    to the issue as compared to others. Indeed, brevity in a jury charge is
    desired: <i>R. v. Daley</i>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 56.
    Rather, the extent to which a judge must review the evidence depends upon the
    particular case. The test is one of fairness. The charge will be adequate when
    the judge puts the evidence to the jury in a manner that will allow it to fully
    appreciate the issues and the defence presented: <i>R. v. Rodgerson</i>, 2015

    adequacy of a charge in the context of the entire trial and ask if the jury
    would have understood the issues of fact, the relevant legal principles, how
    the facts related to the law, and the positions of the parties: <i>Caza v.
    Kirkland and District Hospital</i> (2003), 172 O.A.C. 388 (C.A.), [2003] O.J.

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In the present case, the fairness of the
    trial judge’s charge on causation also must be assessed against the background
    of the closing submissions appellants’ counsel gave the day before the charge: <i>Daley</i>,
    at para. 58. In his closing, appellants’ counsel argued the respondent’s theory
    contained “five key steps” that formed a “chain of causation”. According to the
    appellants, the respondent could not establish that any breach of the standard
    of care by the appellants had caused Rossana’s death unless he proved each one
    of the key steps probably would have occurred. The key steps were: (i) the
    existence of a strong suspicion Rossana suffered from cardiac tamponade, which
    would justify calling a cardiologist into the Hospital; (ii) the cardiologist
    would be able to drive a long distance to the Hospital in inclement weather in
    sufficient time to perform an echocardiogram and “fortuitously” diagnose viral
    myocarditis; (iii) the prescription of two temporizing measure drugs –
    vasopressors and inotropes – and proof they would have a beneficial effect;
    (iv) Rosanna would have received some sort of mechanical heart support in time;
    and (v) all those steps would occur within nine hours of Rossana’s admission. </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>Appellants’ counsel devoted slightly more
    than half of his closing to exhaustively reviewing for the jury the evidence
    relating to each of the five key steps. He also spent considerable time
    explaining why the jury should prefer the appellants’ experts’ evidence over the
    respondent’s.</span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>The trial judge charged the jury the day
    after both counsel gave their closing submissions. He described his
    instructions on causation as a “very brief”, but “very important” section of
    his charge. He emphasized it was not sufficient for the respondent to establish
    the appellants had fallen below the standard of care in their treatment of
    Rossana. As well, “[y]ou must be satisfied that but for the substandard conduct
    you have identified it was more likely than not that [Rosanna] would not have
    died.” </span></p>

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>In his charge on the standard of care, the
    trial judge referred to the “5-point analysis” appellants’ counsel set out in
    his closing. The trial judge referred to it again in his section on causation,
    dealing with some of the specific elements of the appellants’ analysis.</span></p>

    repeat the exhaustive review of the evidence on the “5 key steps” appellants’
    counsel had given the day before in his closing. Instead, the trial judge
    properly instructed the jury on the legal principles of causation and provided

    to answer the questions on causation.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The questions on causation will read as follows: If your answer

    his refusal to poll the jury for the reason proposed by the appellants was

    or causation found by the jury. As explained above, a jury is entitled to
    arrive at an answer to a “bottom line” question or verdict by different
    evidentiary routes. Consequently, polling jurors on their responses to the
    “particulars” portion of any question would be an exercise without legal
