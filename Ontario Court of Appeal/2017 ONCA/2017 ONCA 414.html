    blueprint and building materials. It requires negotiation of approval processes
    involving regulatory bodies operating under a range of provincial legislation,
    regulations and municipal bylaws. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Alex and Tania Gilmor (“the respondents”)
    purchased a lot in 2009. They decided to build their home without first
    obtaining any of the required approvals. This decision has resulted in years of
    litigation and a home that remains unfinished.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Part of their lot is on a floodplain –
    “hazardous land” within the meaning of the <em>Conservation Authorities Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.27 (“<em>CAA</em>”), so-called because it is </span><span
lang=EN-US>“land that could be unsafe for development”, among other things
    because of flooding (s. 28(25)). The land </span><span lang=EN-US>is subject to
    the control of the Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority (“the NVCA”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The NVCA denied the respondents’ application for
    approval to build in 2011. The respondents appealed the NVCA’s decision to the
    Mining and Lands Commissioner, who conducted a hearing <em>de novo</em> in
    2013. The Commissioner found that the respondents’ proposed development was
    neither appropriate nor safe and denied approval.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents appealed the Commissioner’s
    decision to the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court allowed their appeal and
    directed the approval of their proposed development by the NVCA without
    conditions.</span></p>

    respondents was properly advanced. The Minister of Natural Resources and
    Forestry and Conservation Ontario intervene with leave of the court.</span></p>

    management, sets out a procedure for the establishment of conservation
    authorities across the province, including the NVCA. Conservation authorities
    have jurisdiction over areas that include a watershed – defined as an area
    drained by a river and its tributaries – and in particular over the “control of
    flooding”. Section 20(1) of the <em>CAA</em> sets out the objects of
    authorities, which include conservation, restoration, development and
    management of the watershed. Section 21(1) provides that authorities have the
    power:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(j)       to control the flow of surface waters in
    order to prevent floods or pollution or to reduce the adverse effects thereof;</p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>In addition, s. 28(1) empowers authorities

    permission of the authority for development if, in the opinion of the
    authority, the control of flooding, erosion, dynamic beaches or pollution or
    the conservation of land may be affected by the development. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3) A regulation made under clause (1) (b) or (c) may
    provide for permission to be granted subject to conditions and for the

    O. Reg. 97/04, which prescribes the content of conservation authority
    regulations and specifically requires that they prohibit development in or on
    hazardous lands, wetlands, and river or stream valleys, whether or not they
    contain an apparent watercourse. Section 3 of that regulation provides as
    follows:</span></p>

    development should be required, if, in the authority’s opinion, the control of

    respondents’ application for permission to build: the location was within a floodway;
    the proposed development did not comply with the NVCA’s Planning and Regulation
    Guidelines; the proposed development was contrary to Natural Hazard policies of
    the Provincial Policy Statement 2005 (“PPS”); the issuance of a permit would
    set a negative precedent; and the proposed development would have a cumulative
    impact by filling in the floodplain, with negative impacts on flood control and
    conservation of land.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner held a four-day <em>de novo</em> hearing, which included cross-examination of expert witnesses and a visit to
    the proposed development site. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner issued a 58-page decision. The decision
    is not easy to follow. I summarize the findings on the five issues the
    Commissioner identified as relevant to her decision below.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:none'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The relevance of law, policies, and guidelines</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner found that two policy documents
    – the NVCA Planning and Regulation Guidelines, and the NVCA Development Review
    Guidelines – were relevant considerations, along with two provincial documents
    – the PPS and the Ministry of Natural Resources Technical Guide.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:none'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The general practice of conservation authorities</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner found that development within
    wetlands or areas that could interfere with the hydrologic function of a
    wetland is prohibited by s. 2(1) of O. Reg. 172/06, subject to the NVCA’s discretion
    to grant permission to develop under s. 3. The proposed development site is
    within a floodway, and the burden was on the respondents to convince the
    Commissioner to exercise her discretion to permit the proposed development. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner found, further, that crossing
    wetland or hazardous land to secure access to a building was not in the best
    interests of the land, and was not appropriate. Building the house at the rear
    of the property, off the floodplain, was not an acceptable alternative.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:none'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The reasonableness/appropriateness of policies
    and guidelines</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner found that O. Reg. 172/06
    generally opposes development within any hazard area, but noted that it does
    not outline the reasons why, such as the potential danger to anyone living
    there. The NVCA guidelines describe the prevention of “loss of life and
    property due to flooding” as a “principal mandate”. The Commissioner
    acknowledged that a different view had been taken in <em>Junker v. Grand River
    Conservation Authority</em>, C.A. 83/91 (Ont. Mining and Lands Commissioner), but
    considered that sufficient evidence existed to support the authority’s
    responsibility to prevent loss of life and property. This included the
    development of Flood Warning Systems, the purchase of floodplain lands, the
    management of floodplains and waterways, and projects to control both flooding
    and erosion. The Commissioner adopted the NVCA’s stated goal of ensuring safe access
    and egress to a development site.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US style='text-decoration:none'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The suitability of the site for human habitation</span></h3>

    the proposed development site was located on the edge of a regulated floodway within
    a backwater, where a reservoir or pooling effect would occur in the event of a
    flood. Flooding to a depth of approximately one metre could be expected during
    the benchmark Timmins storm, and the backwater effect would lower the velocity
    of the water. The Commissioner accepted that impact on the wetlands would be
    limited and was not a reason to deny permission for development, as long as
    protection against incursion into the wetland was provided.</span></p>

    accordance with the discretionary terms of the regulation. The Commissioner
    found the respondents’ proposal would not aggravate flooding in the area to any
    great degree and that hydraulic impact would probably be minimized. However,
    any new residential construction could increase the hazard in the area.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The Commissioner applied flooding depth figures suggested by the
    Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources Technical Guide, which were also used by
    the NVCA, in determining the potential depth of flood waters on the proposed
    development site during a Timmins storm. The Commissioner found that the
    respondents’ application met safe access and egress standards in some, but not
    all, of the required areas. The Commissioner found that there was a clear
    failure to meet one of the most important guidelines, access for a family
    vehicle, and that the standard for younger children (under six to ten years of
    age) was not met. The Commissioner added that there was also a risk to
    emergency workers and a cost to the public.</span></p>

    creation of a raised driveway and walkway to the house using a “cut and fill”
    method would solve the problem. In any event, the Commissioner noted that the
    cut and fill technique was normally used at the edges of a floodplain, rather
    than for a single development within a floodplain. The Commissioner stated that
    the cut and fill technique should be used sparingly because it could lead to an
    untold number of applications to develop in a floodplain or floodway resulting
    in a cumulative impact on flood control.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner summarized the suitability
    considerations as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Tribunal finds that the appellant has not
    satisfied its concerns over technical matters, especially concerning safety
    issues. In addition, the tribunal is of the opinion that the application shows
    little concern for the issues surrounding natural hazards and the natural
    heritage which are outlined in both the NVCA’s Regulations and the guidelines
    provided by the PPS, especially from a safety point of view.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner found that the potential
    cumulative effect from development on the respondents’ site would not have much
    impact, but reiterated her concern about setting a precedent that might
    encourage others to propose development in floodplains or floodways.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner dismissed the respondents’
    appeal, but in doing so noted that some aspects of proposed development could
    be revisited by the NVCA:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The tribunal … noted that at least four to five
    issues require further study or at least in depth discussions between the
    parties, all of which relate to technical issues. They are questions the
    tribunal cannot answer due to lack of clear evidence and as a result, any
    decision with regard to them would be questionable. Whether the NVCA is
    prepared to renew discussions of the issues, will be left for them to decide.
    As was noted, it is not just technical issues that should sway the tribunal.
    The floodway has a purpose in the “conservation of land” category and needs to
    be maintained to do its job.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In the final analysis, the tribunal has
    decided that the development in the floodway is inappropriate at this time. The
    risk to the homeowner, both from a standpoint of safety and property damage, as
    well as the subsequent cost to the taxpayer if the Timmins situation or any
    other flood occurs, must be acknowledged and is found to be unacceptable. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Based on the evidence and the reasons
    outlined, the tribunal does not find the application to be appropriate or
    justified especially from a safety point of view and, also from the need to
    maintain the natural floodway. The application cannot be considered unique from
    an environmental standpoint. The tribunal finds that the PPS will take
    precedence along with the mandate of the Conservation Authorities Act and the
    subsequent Regulation. Therefore, the tribunal will order that this appeal will
    be dismissed.</span></p>

    address the nature or scope of an appeal. It provides simply that “an appeal

lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court noted that the proceeding
    was “in the nature of an appeal and not purely a matter of judicial review”,
    but did not develop the distinction. The court acknowledged that reasonableness
    is normally the standard of review applied to questions of law involving the
    interpretation of a tribunal’s home statute, but held that the correctness
    standard applied in this case for two reasons. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the court characterized the question
    before the Commissioner as a matter of general importance to the legal system
    that was beyond the Commissioner’s expertise, citing a prior Divisional Court decision, <em>3437400 Canada Inc. v. Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority</em>, 2012
    ONSC 1503, 354 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 756 (Div. Ct.).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the court stated that the Commissioner’s
    reliance on safety considerations in rejecting the appellant’s application
    “amounted to a positive assertion of jurisdiction to scrutinize applications on
    the basis of safety”, which overlapped with municipal authority to administer
    the <em>Building Code Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c. 23 (“<em>BCA</em>”) and
    possibly the <em>Planning Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13, under which the PPS
    was published. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The court distinguished this court’s decision in <em>Ontario (Ministry of Transportation) v. 1520658 Ontario Inc.</em>, 2011
    ONCA 373, 105 O.R. (3d) 321, which applied a reasonableness standard to an
    appeal under s. 133 of the <em>Mining Act</em>, on the basis that there is no
    privative clause in the <em>CAA</em> and because this case involves a conflict
    between private and public interests, as opposed to a conflict between
    competing uses of Crown lands.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The court then applied a correctness test to the
    Commissioner’s decision. In essence, the court held that the Commissioner erred
    by proceeding from an incorrect interpretation of its governing regulation,
    because neither the <em>CAA</em> nor the NVCA presumptively prohibit
    development on the respondents’ land. The court interpreted s. 3 of O. Reg.
    172/06 as establishing not an exception to a general prohibition on development
    but, instead, a condition precedent to prohibition. As the court put it, “<em>only</em> developments that affect the control of flooding … may be prohibited, regulated
    or subject to a requirement for prior permission.” [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court concluded, further, that
    although safety issues could be considered, safety could not be elevated to a
    stand-alone head of jurisdiction for purposes of regulating flood control.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the court acknowledged that the
    cumulative impact of development may be a relevant consideration, it could not
    be used as a catch-all objection without having first established a reasonable
    foundation for the conclusion. The court characterized the cumulative impact as
    a “minor theoretical impact” that did not satisfy the threshold criterion of
    actual impact on flood control:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>By restricting developments with an impact on
    control of flooding, neither s. 3 of the NVCA Regulation nor s. 28(1)(c) of the
    CAA can reasonably be construed as subjecting developments to control with only
    the most trivial or hypothetical of impacts. The inquiry is not akin to
    studying the impact of fluttering butterfly wings in Mongolia on flooding in
    Amaranth Township. Flood control impacts, if they were to be found, require
    evidence and a foundation that satisfies standards of reasonableness and
    materiality. I do not read the reasons of the Tribunal as suggesting any
    findings reaching that level of concern over “cumulative impact” nor would the
    evidentiary record before it reasonably permit such a finding.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The court set aside the Commissioner’s decision and
    considered the question of flood control itself, rather than remit the matter
    to the Commissioner. The court concluded that the respondents’ proposed
    development would have no impact on flood control and granted the permission sought
    under s. 3 of O. Reg. 172/06.</span></p>

    and a standard of review analysis is not always required in order to determine
    which standard applies. In a series of cases, the court has established that
    the reasonableness standard applies presumptively when a tribunal is
    interpreting its home statute or statutes that are closely related to its
    function: <em>Edmonton (City) v Edmonton East (Capilano) Shopping Centres Ltd.</em>,

    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.31 – but the Commissioner is no less entitled to deference in
    interpreting and applying the <em>CAA</em> on that account. The institutional
    expertise of a tribunal performing duties under a particular statute does not
    depend on the tribunal’s constitution under that statute, nor is it diminished
    by a legislative decision to assign decision making authority to that tribunal

    administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular
    result. Instead, they may give rise to a number of possible, reasonable
    conclusions. Tribunals have a margin of appreciation within the range of
    acceptable and rational solutions. A court conducting a review for
    reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a decision reasonable,
    referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In
    judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of
    justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making

    interpretation, and chose not to do so. In conducting reasonableness review, it
    is of no moment whether a court considers its interpretation of the law
    superior to the one adopted by the tribunal whose decision is being reviewed. Unreasonableness

    clearly inform the prohibition: as noted above, s. 28(25) of the <em>CAA</em> defines “hazardous lands” – lands subject to the prohibition – as “lands that
    could be unsafe for development because of naturally occurring processes
    associated with flooding”. On the other hand, development on hazardous lands
    may be permitted in the floodplain pursuant to the exercise of discretion under
    s. 3 of the regulation, if, in the opinion of the authority or the Commissioner,
    “the control of flooding… will not be affected by the development”. Safety is

    “The reasons why development is not supported, such as the potential danger to
    anyone living there, are not outlined as such in the Regulation.” Nevertheless,
    the Commissioner asserted that the discretionary power to permit development
    “indicates concern regarding any development in the floodway which might damage
    people and property. If they were not potential problems, there would be no
    need for the Regulation.”</span></p>

    and proper factors to be considered in the exercise of the discretion under s.

    Court understood the term “control of flooding” in a narrow, literal sense, as
    limited to controlling the flow of surface waters. On this approach, the NVCA
    could enhance public safety only indirectly, “by performing its mandate and
    gaining greater knowledge of floods and the means of controlling or mitigating
    them” (para. 64). </span></p>

    safety considerations into account in determining whether to exercise the
    discretion under s. 3 to permit development on the floodplain. The prohibition
    on development in s. 2 of the regulation – common to the regulations of
    conservation authorities across the province – reflects a strategy of directing
    development away from floodplains. Given the history of flooding in Ontario, it
    is reasonable to conclude that the reasons for the prohibition include public
    safety as well as conservation considerations.</span></p>

    difference in perspective between the Commissioner and the Divisional Court is
    striking. The Commissioner found the risk posed by a flood on the site of the proposed
    development was great: “The question comes to mind as to why anyone would
    knowingly take on that kind of risk to their lives” (p. 55). In contrast, the
    Divisional Court found that the Commissioner used safety as a “pretext” to
    apply a policy preference prohibiting development, and that the Commissioner
    unreasonably overstated the risk to safety in any event: “The risk of a dangerous
    flood that genuinely posed a safety risk did not exist” (para. 67).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Commissioner’s decision on flood safety, and
    in particular the ability of people to enter and exit development areas, was
    informed by consideration of the PPS, which clearly expresses provincial policy
    of directing development away from hazardous lands, and by standards set out in
    the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s Technical Guide and the NVCA
    policies. The Commissioner did not fetter her discretion in taking these policies
    and standards into account, nor is there any basis for concluding that the
    Commissioner invoked safety considerations as a pretext for applying a policy
    preference for a blanket ban on development. The prohibition of development in
    the floodplain arose by operation of the regulation, not by the exercise of the
    Commissioner’s policy preference. There is no basis for the respondents’ submissions,
    made at the hearing of this appeal, alleging corruption and misconduct on the
    part of the NVCA.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It might be thought that the Commissioner took a
    fairly strict approach to public safety, denying approval even though the
    proposed development met some of the flood safety guidelines. Certainly, the
    Divisional Court thought so. The court asserted that the proposed development
    “posed no meaningful threat to safety” and that safety was “elevated out of all
    proportion to a reasonable assessment of it”. The court went so far as to
    minimize the very concept of risk, adding that “elimination of all risk in all
    endeavours is neither possible nor desirable”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, the court erred in doing so. The
    court’s task in conducting reasonableness review is not to weigh the evidence, reach
    its own judgment, and then use that judgment as a benchmark for assessing the
    reasonableness of the Commissioner’s decision. </span></p>

    of making the discretionary decision whether to permit development on the
    floodplain, not the court. The evidence established that, in the event of a
    Timmins storm, the proposed development would be cut-off from the road by a
    pool of slow moving water, rising to a depth of approximately 0.8 metres. These
    were the circumstances in which the Commissioner exercised her discretion not
    to permit the proposed development. It may be that, as the Divisional Court
    noted, a Timmins storm is unlikely to occur, but it cannot be said that the
    Commissioner’s concerns about access to and egress from the site in the event
