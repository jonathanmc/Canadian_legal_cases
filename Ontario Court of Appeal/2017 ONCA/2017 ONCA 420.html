  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant Burlington Airpark Inc.
    (“Airpark”) owns an aerodrome located in the City of Burlington, the respondent
    on this appeal. Airpark appeals an order requiring it to file an application
    for a permit under Burlington’s By-Law 64-2014 for fill work and site
    alteration carried out before the 2014 By-Law was passed and while an earlier
    by-law was in effect. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Airpark’s fill and site alteration work
    commenced in 2008. Until 2013, Burlington accepted that the work was part of an
    airport improvement and therefore not subject to regulation by a municipality.
    In 2013, Airpark applied for a severance to obtain land needed to extend the
    main runway. At that point, Burlington investigated and took the position that
    Airpark was conducting a commercial fill operation and that By-Law 6-2003 did
    apply. Accordingly, Burlington issued a notice to comply. Airpark took the
    position that, as an aerodrome, pursuant to the </span><em>Constitution Act,
    1867</em><span lang=EN-US> it was not subject to the 2003 by-law. A consent
    order was entered precluding Airpark from conducting any further fill or site
    alteration work pending the determination of Burlington’s application to
    enforce compliance with the 2003 by-law. Murray J. ruled in November 2013 that
    Airpark was subject to the 2003 by-law: </span><em>Burlington Airpark v.
    Burlington (City),</em><span lang=EN-US> 2013 ONSC 6990, 17 M.P.L.R. (5th) 254.
    That decision was upheld by this court in June 2014: 2014 ONCA 468, 23 M.P.L.R.
    (5th) 1. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While those cross-applications were before the
    courts, Burlington prepared a more stringent by-law to replace the 2003 by-law.
    By-Law 64-2014 was passed on September 22, 2014. By its terms, the 2014 by-law
    repealed the 2003 by-law with no transitional provision to continue the 2003
    by-law, and came into force on the date of its passing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The central issue on this appeal is whether
    Burlington can require Airpark to apply for a permit under the 2014 by-law for
    work Airport did prior to the enactment of that by-law.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Airpark is a registered aerodrome pursuant to the <em>Aeronautics Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-2</span></em> and the <em>Canadian
    Aviation Regulations</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, SOR/96-433</span></em><em>.</em> It was established in 1962 and provides a base for corporate airlines, a flight
    training school, patient and organ transfer flights and other aviation
    activities and aviation-related businesses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Airpark acquired the aerodrome in 2006 and invested nearly $4 million in
    improvements to its infrastructure. These improvements included widening the
    main runway, paving the secondary runway, and adding new taxiways and hangars.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2008, Airpark began levelling the land to the west of the main runway
    to bring it up to the same grade as the runway and to permit aircraft to taxi
    safely to and from the runway. This involved the importation of fill.
    Burlington officials provided a report to Council in 2009 stating that, as the
    work related to aeronautics, the work was under federal jurisdiction and the
    local municipality’s by-laws did not apply. Airpark maintains that it performed
    the fill work on this understanding. Burlington maintains that its position was
    based on Airpark’s representations that the fill was in fact for airport
    expansion work, that the fill was clean, and that the work would end in the
    summer of 2009. Burlington alleges that those representations were untrue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2013, Burlington began receiving complaints from neighbouring
    landowners regarding noise, drainage problems, dust and traffic safety arising
    from Airpark’s fill operation. Airpark had filed a severance application to
    allow it to purchase abutting lands in order to extend the main runway. This
    met with community opposition and was subsequently withdrawn. In response,
    Burlington investigated the matter and concluded that work had not been
    performed as initially described in numerous respects, including the amount of
    fill deposited, its cleanliness, and the purpose for which the fill was
    deposited. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Burlington took the position that Airpark was depositing fill as a
    commercial activity rather than as a planned expansion of its aeronautical
    facilities. It issued an order for Airpark to comply with the 2003 by-law.
    Burlington then issued a violation notice but took no further enforcement
    proceedings. At that point, Airpark had completed 95 to 97% of its proposed
    fill work.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Airpark brought an application seeking a declaration that its operations
    were governed by the <em>Aeronautics Act</em> and that Burlington’s by-law did
    not apply to its activities.  Burlington brought its own application for a
    declaration that the 2003 by-law was binding on Airpark. A consent order was
    made pursuant to which Airpark ceased fill and grading operations pending the
    determination of the applications. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Murray J. dismissed Airpark’s application and declared that the by-law
    was binding on Airpark in respect of its fill operations at the airport. He
    noted that Burlington knew of the work and took no steps to enforce the by-law,
    and he stated that this “may have a bearing on Burlington’s ability to enforce
    its by-law with respect to construction already completed”: 2013 ONSC 6990, at
    para. 13. <span lang=EN-US>Murray J. declined to make any enforcement order,
    stating that “[t]he issue of enforcement is properly left to the municipal
    authorities” (para. 26). </span>This court upheld that decision: <span
style='line-height:100%;color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>2014 ONCA 468</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2013, while those applications were pending before the Superior Court
    and this court, Burlington undertook a review of the airport that included a
    plan to pass a new by-law. In September 2014, after the release of this court’s
    2014 decision, Burlington passed By-Law 64-2014, repealing the 2003 by-law and establishing
    a new regime prohibiting any dumping or removal of fill or altering of grades
    without a permit. The 2014 by-law contains a number of provisions that are more
    onerous than those found in the 2003 by-law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between the dismissal of Airpark’s appeal and the enactment of the new
    by-law in September 2014, Burlington made several requests of Airpark to file
    an application for a Site Alteration Permit under the 2003 by-law, which
    Airpark refused to do. After the 2014 by-law was passed and the 2003 by-law was
    repealed, Burlington made several more requests of Airpark to file an
    application under the new by-law. Airpark again refused, maintaining that the 2014
    by-law could not be applied retroactively. Airpark did apply under the 2014
    by-law for a permit to complete its work. Burlington refused to process that
    application unless Airpark submitted an application for a permit under the 2014
    by-law relating to the work that had been performed before the 2014 by-law was
    enacted.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DECISION OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2015, Burlington commenced the application now under appeal
    seeking a mandatory order under the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>, S.O. 2001, c.
    25, s. 440, requiring Airpark to remove all fill deposited since 2008 by
    November 30, 2015 or, in the alternative, an order requiring Airpark to submit
    an application under the 2014 by-law for all work performed since 2008.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Airpark resisted the application on several grounds. Airpark argued that
    the by-law could not be applied retroactively, that it was constitutionally
    inapplicable to its operations as Burlington had, in effect, enacted the by-law
    to specifically target Airpark’s aeronautics operation, that the by-law was
    impermissibly vague, and that the application was out of time and barred by the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, S.O. 2002,
    c. 24, Sch. B</span></em><em>. </em>Airpark also contested Burlington’s
    evidence regarding the quality of the fill it had deposited and relied on
    evidence that the fill and grading activities were related to airport safety. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that Airpark’s constitutional argument was
    the same as the one it made unsuccessfully in 2013, and before this court in
    2014, with respect to the earlier by-law. He agreed with Murray J.’s finding
    that compliance with the by-law would not impair the federal aeronautics power
    or create an operational conflict, because the by-law’s substance in this case
    was the regulation of alleged commercial landfill activity on the site and not
    aeronautics activity. He further found that Airpark was in fact operating a
    commercial landfill business on the site and that not all the fill it deposited
    was required for the purpose of airport modifications. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected Airpark’s argument that the by-law was
    impermissibly vague. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge did not specifically deal with the retroactivity
    issue but held that Burlington’s application was not barred by the <em>Limitations
    Act</em> and adopted Burlington’s submission that the proceedings it had
    commenced under the 2003 by-law were automatically continued by the <em>Legislation
    Act, 2006,</em> S.O. 2006, c. 21, Sch. F., s. 52, as if they had been taken
    under the 2014 by-law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge determined that there was insufficient evidence to
    support an order for the removal of the fill and decided that the appropriate
    order was to require Airpark to submit a complete application under the new
    2014 by-law, with respect to the work it had already performed. He held that
    this would be the “best mechanism to advance the expeditious exploration of the
    issue [of contamination] and to require Airpark to participate constructively
    in the process”: para. 120. He awarded Burlington costs on a substantial
    indemnity basis, fixed at $118,000. </p>

    The by-law repeals the 2003 by-law and makes no provision for its continuing
    application. Part 14 of the 2014 by-law provides that the 2003 by-law “is
    hereby repealed” (s. 14.01) and that the 2014 by-law “shall come into full
    force and effect on the date of its passing” (s. 14.02). There is no
    transitional provision to bridge the repeal of the 2003 by-law and the
    enactment of the 2014 by-law. I discuss below the question whether the 2003
    by-law is continued by the </span><em>Legislation Act, 2006</em><span

    anyone who proposes to dump or remove fill or to alter the grade of lands
    within the municipality to obtain a permit to do so unless there is something
    in the by-law stating that a permit is not required. Section 2.02 of the 2014
    by-law provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>No person shall place,
    dump, cut or remove any fill, or cause or permit the placing, dumping, cutting
    or removal of fill on, nor alter or cause or permit the alteration of the grade
    of any lands in the City, including any lands which are submerged under any
    watercourse or other body of water, or along the Lake Ontario or Burlington Bay
    shoreline, without having first obtained a Site Alteration Permit issued by the

    requirements for an Application for a Site Alteration Permit and s. 4.04.02
    stipulates the requirements of a Control Plan that is to be submitted at the
    same time. Detailed provision for the required supporting documentation is made
    in s. 4.06 and the required details of hauling information is set out in s.

    can justify requiring remediation of work conducted or a situation created
    before the by-law came into force. Nor does the language of the 2014 by-law
    support Burlington’s position that it can be applied to require Airpark to
    obtain a permit for work done before the 2014 by-law came into force. The
    entire thrust of the 2014 by-law is prospective. It is directed at requiring
    permits </span><em>before</em><span lang=EN-US> work is undertaken. The
    provisions dealing with sanctions for conducting fill or site alteration work
    without a permit are all tied to failure to obtain a permit under the 2014
    by-law. No provision is made for remediating work done without a permit under
    the 2003 by-law. The conditions for obtaining a permit under the 2014 by-law
    are more stringent that those that existed under the 2003 by-law. One of
    Burlington’s principal concerns is with the quality of fill used by Airpark. As
    I have noted, s. 2.10, dealing with the quality of fill, sets the standard as
    that laid down in a January 2014 Guide for Best Management Practices. I fail to
    see how Airpark could be held to that standard for work that it conducted years
    earlier when a different standard prevailed under a different by-law. </span></p>

    does not operate retrospectively by attaching new consequences for the future
    with respect to a prior event. The purpose and effect of the 2014 by-law is to
    require a permit based upon standards set in 2014 for the dumping of fill or
    alteration of the grade of land. To require Airpark to obtain a permit in 2014
    based upon standards set in 2014 for work already conducted years ago in 2008

    Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue),</em><span
lang=EN-US> [1977] 1 S.C.R. 271, at p. 279. I see no language in the 2014
    by-law to suggest that it was intended to operate retroactively. As I have
    noted, the 2014 by-law does provide for remedial work where dumping or altering
    the grade took place without a permit. However, those provisions apply only to
    work conducted without a permit having been issued under the 2014 by-law. I see
    nothing in the by-law indicating an intention to reach back in time and apply
    the standards of 2014 to work done before the 2014 by-law was enacted.</span></p>

    place, dump, cut or remove any fill, or cause <em>or permit </em>the placing,
    dumping, cutting or removal of fill on, nor alter or cause <em>or permit</em> the alteration of the grade of any lands in the City” without the required Site
    Alteration Permit [emphasis added]. It was suggested that, as the by-law
    forbids<em> permitting</em> the dumping of fill or the alteration of the grade,
    it might be applied to Airpark’s situation retrospectively rather than
    retroactively as Airpark has permitted the fill to remain and the grade to be
    altered after the 2014 by-law was enacted. </p>

    alteration of the grade” are aimed at the situation where an owner or occupant
    allows someone else to dump fill or alter the grade. The intention, in my view,
    is to make owners and occupiers responsible for all work carried out on their
    lands, whoever actually performs the work, and not to extend the application of
    the by-law to the entire history of past dumping and grade alteration whenever
