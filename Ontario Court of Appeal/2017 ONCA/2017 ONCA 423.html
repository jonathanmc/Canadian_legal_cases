style='font-weight:normal;font-style:normal'>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 16, 2017, we allowed the appeal with
    reasons to follow. These reasons explain why the appeal was allowed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>E. H. was found guilty of two counts of sexual
    assault and two counts of sexual interference. The offences were alleged to
    have occurred between 2002 and 2004. The complainants were the two daughters of
    his girlfriend at the time. They were 7-9 and 12-14 years old at the time of
    the offences, and 16 and 22 at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainants testified that the appellant
    touched them in their bedrooms at night. The appellant testified and denied the
    allegations. The trial judge rejected his evidence. She accepted the complainants'
    evidence and concluded that the appellant's guilt was established beyond a
    reasonable doubt. The appellant was sentenced to 2 years less one-day
    imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant advances a number of grounds of
    appeal focused on the trial judge's credibility assessments. He argues that his
    sentence was too harsh. The appellant also alleges ineffective assistance of
    his trial counsel (not Ms. Chozik). Given that we allow the appeal on this
    basis, it is not necessary to address the other grounds of appeal, or the
    sentence appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The fresh evidence establishes that trial
    counsel failed to view the three-hour statement that the appellant gave to the
    police. The DVD containing the statement was defective. Trial counsel did not
    request another copy from the Crown. He relied upon a synopsis of the statement
    prepared by the police. He failed to review the statement with the appellant,
    despite his repeated requests. At the end of the Crown's case, trial counsel
    spoke to the Crown and conceded that the statement was voluntary and that the appellant
    could be cross-examined on it. He had not discussed with the appellant the
    circumstances surrounding the giving of the statement and he failed to forewarn
    the appellant of what was about to happen. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was taken by surprise when he was cross-examined
    on his statement, which he had given some 17 months earlier. He had difficulty
    recalling what he said to the police. He was cross-examined on isolated
    passages from the lengthy statement. He tried to explain the circumstances
    surrounding the giving of the statement and what he meant in the passages that
    were put to him. The trial Crown (not Ms. Wheeler) instructed the appellant to
    answer her questions more directly and to stop going off topic. Unaware of the
    details of the statement, trial counsel did not intervene, nor was he able to
    utilize re-examination to place the isolated passages in their proper context.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This aspect of the appellant's cross-examination
    was critical to the trial judge's rejection of his evidence. She found the
    appellant was &quot;very evasive to the questions that were put to him&quot; and had &quot;his
    own agenda to get across to the court whenever he could.&quot; The trial judge
    accepted the Crown's submission that the appellant's answers were discrepant
    with his statement, holding: &quot;These contradictions make his evidence at trial
    not believable&quot; and &quot;I cannot accept his evidence as credible due to these
    contradictions.&quot;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As part of his claim of ineffective assistance
    of trial counsel, the appellant swore an affidavit and was cross-examined. He
    explained the circumstances leading up to his attendance at the police station.
    He thought he was going to discuss a completely different incident, one that he
    had previously reported. He was taken by surprise when the police questioned
    him about offences alleged to have occurred many years earlier, in 2002 and
    2004.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified that he was shocked to
    be cross-examined on his statement at trial. He felt unprepared and believed
    that it impacted adversely on his performance as a witness and his ability to
    explain the alleged inconsistencies that were put to him in cross-examination.
    Indeed, the appellant swears that his statement was not inconsistent with his
    trial testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant's background is relevant to what
    happened in this case. He came to Canada as a refugee from Iraq in 1998. English
    is not his first language. He was not offered an interpreter during his
    interview with the police. It is apparent that he struggled to understand many
    of the officer's questions. Although the appellant had the benefit of an interpreter
    at trial, he still struggled with terminology.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Wheeler does not dispute that the
    performance of trial counsel fell below the standard of reasonable professional
    assistance in a criminal case. We agree with this fair assessment. Given the
    live issues at trial and the circumstances under which the statement was
    obtained, the appellant has established that trial counsel's conduct fell short
    of what can reasonably expected: see </span><em>R. v. B. (G.B.)</em>, <span
lang=EN-US>2000 SCC 22, at para. 24.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Notwithstanding this failing, Ms. Wheeler urges
    us to be hesitant in concluding that the appellant has suffered prejudice in a
    manner that affected the outcome of his case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was significantly prejudiced.
    Without notice from his counsel, he was cross-examined on a statement he gave
    without an interpreter 17-months earlier. He was totally unprepared for what
    happened. So was his trial counsel, who was unable to ensure that the appellant
    had a proper opportunity to explain the alleged inconsistencies. Nevertheless,
    and through no fault of her own, the trial judge rejected the appellant's
    evidence because of these &quot;contradictions.&quot; Her findings, which were
    unequivocal and unqualified, were a reasonable response to the evidence before
    her. However, with hindsight, we now know that: (1) the appellant's very poor
    performance was due to trial counsel's ineffectiveness; and (2) the apparent &quot;contradictions&quot;
    between the appellant's statement and his trial evidence would have been either
    explained away or made more benign had the appellant been properly prepared, or
    had trial counsel been equipped to re-examine on these areas. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are satisfied that the appellant has established
    a &quot;reasonable possibility&quot; that the outcome of the trial would have been
    different had trial counsel properly discharged his professional obligations:
