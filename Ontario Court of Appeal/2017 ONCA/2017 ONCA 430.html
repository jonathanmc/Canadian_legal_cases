  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on May 4, 2015 and
    the sentence imposed on June 23, 2015 by Justice Nancy L. Backhouse of the Superior
    Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Judge>van Rensburg J.A.:</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for possession of cocaine for the
    purpose of trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime. He seeks leave to
    appeal his sentence of five years’ imprisonment, less nine months’ credit on
    account of restrictive bail conditions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction
    and sentence.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background Facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The investigation of the appellant began when a confidential informant
    (“CI”) told the police that he or she had purchased cocaine from the appellant (whom
    he knew as “Rocky”) and his roommate Carl Morris (“Morris”) and that the
    appellant was in possession of a gun. The police conducted surveillance at the
    address provided by the CI and observed a person that the police identified as
    the appellant at the address. Based on the CI’s information and the
    surveillance evidence, the police applied for a telewarrant pursuant to s.
    487.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>to search the appellant’s residence
    for a handgun, identification and cocaine, as evidence in respect of an offence
    under s. 91(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following day, after he was observed engaging in several hand-to-hand
    transactions suggestive of drug trafficking, the appellant was arrested and was
    found to be in possession of narcotics. The police then executed the search
    warrant, and discovered cocaine, a quantity of Canadian and U.S. currency and
    drug trafficking paraphernalia in the appellant’s apartment. No gun was located
    in the search of the appellant or his residence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant brought an application under s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em> to challenge the legality of the search warrant and the admissibility of the
    evidence obtained in the execution of the warrant (the “<em>Garofoli</em> application”). The Crown, after conceding that the Information to Obtain
    (“ITO”) that was redacted to protect the CI’s identity did not establish
    reasonable and probable grounds for issuing the warrant, resorted to the
    procedure now known as step six<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a>,
    which was first described in <em>R. v. Garofoli</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421. The
    trial judge dismissed the <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the evidence obtained through the execution
    of the search warrant was sufficient to establish the appellant’s guilt beyond
    a reasonable doubt, and she convicted him of the two offences. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conviction Appeal – Alleged Errors in the <i>Garofoli</i> Application</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The conviction appeal concerns the trial judge’s disposition
    of the </span><em>Garofoli</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>application</span>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial judge’s decision on a <em>Garofoli</em> application is entitled
    to deference. An appellate court should not interfere with the trial judge’s
    disposition of the application, absent an error in law, a misapprehension of the
    evidence or a failure to consider relevant evidence: <em>R. v. Grant</em> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 531 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 18, leave to appeal refused
    [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 168; <em>R. v. Ebanks</em>, 2009 ONCA 851, <span
style='color:black;background:white'>97 O.R. (3d) 721,</span> at para. 22,
    leave to appeal refused [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 84.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant alleges there were four such errors warranting
    intervention by this court.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasonable and Probable Grounds with Respect to the Firearm Offence</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant says that the ITO did not
    provide reasonable and probable grounds to believe an offence had been
    committed under s. 91(1) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><i><span
lang=EN-US>. </span></i><span lang=EN-US>The affiant of the ITO deposed that he
    believed the appellant was in possession of a handgun, based on the CI’s
    information that he had seen the gun in the appellant’s possession. The ITO did
    not, however, provide any evidence that the appellant’s possession of the
    handgun was illegal. The ITO does not indicate, says the appellant, that the
    police took any investigative steps to determine whether the appellant had a valid
    firearm licence or certificate, or was prohibited from possessing a firearm by
    an order under the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>. The
    appellant refers to </span><em>R. v. Ball</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2014 ONCJ 265,
    [2014] O.J. No. 2552, at para. 12 and </span><em>R. v. Boussalas</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2014 ONSC 5542, 320 C.R.R. (2d) 64, at para. 37, as cases in which
    the police took investigative steps to determine whether the accused was in
    lawful possession of a firearm.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this argument. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s illegal possession of the
    handgun could be inferred reasonably, if not inevitably, from the circumstances
    set out in the ITO. The appellant had a criminal record, which included
    offences that attracted a mandatory weapons prohibition under s. 109 of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span lang=EN-US>. Further, it was reasonable to assume that the possession
    of a gun by the appellant in the context of his activities as a drug dealer
    would be illegal. In these circumstances, the trial judge committed no error in
    concluding that the ITO disclosed reasonable and probable grounds to believe
    the appellant was unlawfully in possession of a firearm.</span></p>
  <h2><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=EN-US>Denial of Leave to Cross-examine the ITO
    Affiant</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge erred in refusing leave to cross-examine the affiant of the ITO on the </span><em>Garofoli</em><span
lang=EN-US> application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant says that there were a number of topics
    on which cross-examination of the affiant ought to have been allowed: (i) the
    affiant’s failure to include the CI’s complete criminal record; (ii) the
    failure to note the date of the appellant’s record for trafficking (which would
    have revealed a 12 year gap between the appellant’s last conviction and the
    date of the investigation); (iii) the overstatement by the affiant that all of the
    CI’s information had been corroborated; (iv) the bald statement that police surveillance
    showed acts indicative of drug dealing; (v) the affiant’s resort to the
    telewarrant process when it may have been unnecessary; and (vi) the fact that
    the police did not seek a warrant in respect of Morris under the </span><em>Controlled
    Drugs and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 19<i><span lang=EN-US>.</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> The appellant says that cross-examination of the affiant on any of
    these topics could have elicited evidence of sloppiness, conclusory reasoning and
    exaggeration by the affiant, from which it could be inferred that the police
    misled the issuing justice. He argues that leave should have been granted
    because all of the proposed areas of cross-examination went to the affiant’s
    reasonable belief and could have discredited the grounds for issuing the
    warrant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='color:#333333'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To satisfy the test for leave to cross-examine the affiant of an
    ITO, “[a] basis must be shown by the accused for the view that
    cross-examination will elicit testimony tending to discredit the existence of one
    of the preconditions to the authorization, as for example the existence of reasonable
    and probable grounds”: <em>Garofoli,</em> at p. 1465; <em>R. v. Pires</em><i>; <em>R.
    v. Lising</em></i>, 2005 SCC 66, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 343, at para. 40; <em>R. v.
    Sadikov</em>, 2014 ONCA 72, 305 C.C.C. (3d) 421, at para. 39. The trial judge
    must be satisfied that the proposed cross-examination is reasonably likely to
    assist in determining whether the necessary grounds existed for the issuance of
    the search warrant: <em>R. v. Green</em>, 2015 ONCA 579, 337 O.A.C. 72, at
    para. 34. The focus of the cross-examination, if leave is granted, is on the reasonableness
    and honesty of the affiant’s belief as to the existence of reasonable and
    probable grounds, and not on the ultimate accuracy of the information relied on
    by the affiant: <em>Pires</em><i>, </i>at para. 41; <em>Green</em>, at para.
    34. A decision to refuse leave to cross-examine the affiant is discretionary
    and, absent evidence that the trial judge did not exercise his or her
    discretion judicially, is entitled to deference: <em>Pires</em>, at paras.
    46-47; <em>Green</em>, at para. 52.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge identified the correct test from </span><em>Garofoli</em> <span lang=EN-US>at para. 12 of her reasons. She then
    observed that weaknesses in the ITO were matters for argument on the </span><em>Garofoli</em><span
lang=EN-US> application, and that there was no evidence to support a claim that
    the affiant deliberately concealed relevant information or deliberately
    provided misleading information. She also adverted to the risk that
    cross-examination might reveal the identity of the CI. She concluded that the
    applicant had not established that the proposed cross-examination would elicit
    testimony tending to discredit the existence of one of the preconditions to the
    authorization of the search warrant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant says the trial judge applied too onerous
    a test on the application to cross-examine by requiring him to show that the
    affiant </span><span class=Underline>deliberately</span><span lang=EN-US> concealed relevant information or misled the issuing justice to satisfy the
    test for leave. I disagree. </span>The lack of evidence that the affiant
    deliberately concealed or provided misleading information was only one of the
    factors considered by the trial judge. It was, however, a valid factor.
    Cross-examination will only tend to discredit the existence of one of the
    preconditions to the authorization of the search warrant if it can show that
    the affiant knew or ought to have known the information in the ITO was false: <em>Pires</em>,
    at para. 41; <em>Sadikov</em>, at para. 40. There was no evidence before the
    trial judge to suggest that this was the case. Further, simply pointing to
    omissions, inconsistencies, or conclusory or inaccurate statements is not a
    sufficient basis to permit cross-examination: <em>R. v. Ambrose</em> (1994), 73
    O.A.C. 135, at para. 7 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1995] S.C.C.A. No. 28; <em>Pires</em>, at paras. 40-44. I agree with the trial judge that the proposed
    topics of cross-examination here largely dealt with alleged deficiencies
    apparent on the face of the ITO, which could be addressed through argument.   </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 487.1 of the <em>Code</em> provides for the issuance of a
    telewarrant, and requires the applicant’s “belief that an indictable offence
    has been committed and that it would be impracticable to appear personally
    before a justice to make application for a warrant.” In the ITO, the affiant justified
    the application for a telewarrant by stating that it was after 4:00 p.m., that
    the court house was closed and that a justice of the peace was not available in
    the jurisdiction. The ITO was submitted at 8:32 p.m. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that the conditions for a telewarrant had been
    met. She referred to the decision of this court in <em>R. v. Lao</em>, 2013
    ONCA 285, 305 O.A.C. 346, that “impracticable” under s. 487.1 of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> is not the same as “inconvenient”. She concluded that waiting
    until the following day to obtain a warrant risked failure of the exercise
    because the delay may have stale-dated the CI’s information and because guns
    and drugs are easily transportable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in
    finding that the </span>conditions for a telewarrant under s. 487.1 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> had been satisfied and that her reasons for this decision were not
    supported by the evidence. The fact that the affiant requested three days to
    execute the search warrant suggests that it was not impracticable for the
    affiant to attend personally before a justice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not give effect to this argument. Since the trial judge
    made her decision in this case, the Supreme Court has released its decision in <em>R.
    v. Clark</em>, 2017 SCC 3, [2017] S.C.J. No. 3. In that case, <span lang=EN-US>an
    officer justified the impracticability of obtaining a warrant in person on the
    basis that he was “working a nightshift in the early morning hours and the
    Kelowna Court House is presently closed”. The Supreme Court dismissed the
    appeal for the reasons given by Frankel J.A. in the B.C. Court of Appeal: </span><span
style='color:black;background:white'>2015 BCCA 488</span>, 330 C.C.C. (3d) 448.
    At para. 66, Frankel J.A. stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The telewarrant procedure was designed to make
    it possible for law enforcement officers to apply for a search warrant 24 hours
    a day, seven days a week. Whether the application is made in-person or by fax
    the reasonable-grounds standard must be met before a warrant can be issued. <u>The
    impracticability requirement is concerned with whether it is practicable to
    make an in-person application at the time the application is brought; it does
    not require that an immediate need for a warrant be demonstrated</u>. [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly, in this case, the affiant explained that the court
    house was closed when the application was made. Further, t<span lang=EN-US>he
    trial judge reasonably concluded that waiting 12 hours to obtain a search
    warrant could have impacted the ability to execute the warrant. As in </span><em>Clark</em><span
lang=EN-US>, the onus is on the appellant to demonstrate that it was practicable
    for the affiant to have made an in-person application notwithstanding the fact
    that the court house was closed. The trial judge did not err in her conclusion
    that the “impracticability” requirement for a telewarrant had been met.  </span></p>
  <h2><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-US>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span lang=EN-US>Corroboration of the CI’s Information </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge’s conclusion that the
    information provided by the CI was sufficiently corroborated was unreasonable. In
    particular, the police did not corroborate the information the CI gave them about
    Morris and the appellant living together and their “joint enterprise” selling drugs
    out of their home. The best the police could do was to place Morris as a
    resident of the home three years earlier. Surveillance did not show that Morris
    was connected to the target address or that he had the relationship with the
    appellant described by the CI. Further, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge misapprehended the evidence in concluding that the CI’s description of
    the appellant was “confirmed” by a police officer who identified the appellant
    while conducting surveillance at his home, even though there was no explanation
    of how the identification was made.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asserts that the failure of the police to corroborate
    these details ought to have affected the assessment as to whether CI’s
    information was sufficiently reliable and compelling to justify the issuance of
    a warrant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered and applied the test in <em>R. v. Debot</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1168, which </span></em>required
    her to consider whether the information from the CI was compelling, credible
    and corroborated. She acknowledged that the statement in the ITO that all the
    information provided by the CI had been corroborated was an overstatement and
    she excised this statement from the ITO. After outlining the information from
    the CI that the police had corroborated, the trial judge concluded that the issuing
    justice could reasonably have found that the information from the CI was corroborated.
    In coming to this conclusion, the trial judge noted that where the police
    receive compelling information from a known CI with a track record of
    reliability, “something less in the way of verification might suffice” (at
    para. 27).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the law does not require the police to corroborate every detail
    of a CI’s tip. Rather, the totality of the circumstances must meet the standard
    of reasonableness and weaknesses in one area may, to some extent, be
    compensated by strengths in the other two: <em>Debot</em><i>, </i>at para. 1168.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there were reasonable grounds to justify the issuance of
    the search warrant sought based on the information in the ITO, taken as a whole.
    The CI provided detailed and firsthand information about the appellant. In
    particular, he or she described the handgun, when they last saw it and how many
    times they had seen it. The CI also provided very specific information
    regarding how often and how much cocaine he or she personally purchased from “Rocky”
    who lived at the appellant’s address. As the trial judge correctly noted, the
    information provided by the CI was not commonplace or easily ascertainable. Furthermore,
    it was reasonably open to the issuing justice to find that the CI was credible,
    after considering the CI’s track record of reliability and his or her motive
    for providing the information to the police. In these circumstances, the past
    reliability of the CI and the specific nature of the CI’s information made up
    for the fact that not every aspect of the tip was corroborated.</p>

    15 year gap between these convictions in question and his last drug conviction.
    The appellant also says, that the undue emphasis on his earlier record led the
    trial judge to conclude that there was little prospect of rehabilitation, which
    was contrary to the pre-sentence report. The appellant further contends that

    were “consistent with street-level trafficking and possibly mid-level sales”.
    The trial judge, however, was entitled to arrive at her own assessment based on
    the evidence before her, <span lang=EN-US>which included: the </span>amount of
    cocaine seized from the search of the appellant’s person and his apartment
    (123.34 grams of powder cocaine and 151.98 grams of crack cocaine); the manner

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The</span> trial judge did not err in failing to give
    weight to the 15 year gap in the appellant’s criminal record between his
    convictions. Although she did not mention the gap principle specifically, she
    was alive to the gap because both counsel raised it in their submissions. The
    trial judge also mentioned that the criminal record was somewhat dated but
    found that the appellant had not been deterred by his previous sentence.   </p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred in referring
    to his lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. However, there is no indication
    that this error resulted in an increase in the sentence that otherwise would
    have been imposed. An error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant
    factor or the erroneous consideration of an aggravating or mitigating factor <i>“</i>will
    justify appellate intervention only where it appears from the trial judge’s

    not inflate or elevate the sentence and the sentence imposed is comparable to
    what similarly-situated offenders have received. See, for example, <em>R. v.
