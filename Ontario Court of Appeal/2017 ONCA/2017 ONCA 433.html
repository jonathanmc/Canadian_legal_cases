  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Barbara A. Conway of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated November 25, 2014, with reasons reported
    at 2014 ONSC 3318, 63 C.P.C. (7th) 50.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>van Rensburg J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:none'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from an order denying a partial stay of proceedings in
    favour of arbitration, in the context of a class proceeding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The action involves claims by consumer and business customers against
    TELUS Communications Company, Tele-Mobile Company, and TELUS Communications
    Inc. (together, “TELUS Mobility”). The representative plaintiff claims that
    TELUS Mobility, during the class period, overcharged customers by rounding up
    calls to the next minute without disclosing this practice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TELUS Mobility’s contracts contained standard terms and conditions,
    including a mandatory arbitration clause. TELUS Mobility concedes that the
    effect of s. 7(2) of the <em>Consumer Protection Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002, c.
    30, Sched. A (the “<em>Consumer Protection Act</em>”), is that claims in
    respect of consumer contracts can proceed in court.  It submits, however, that
    the non-consumer claims – that is, the claims of business customers – are
    governed by the mandatory arbitration clause and ought to have been stayed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only issue on appeal is whether the motions judge erred in refusing
    to stay the non-consumer claims pursuant to s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act,
    1991</em>, S.O. 1991, c. 17 (the “<em>Arbitration Act</em>”). Section 7(5)
    provides for a partial stay of court proceedings to be granted where an
    arbitration agreement deals with only some of the matters in respect of which
    the proceeding was commenced and it is reasonable to separate the matters dealt
    with in the agreement from the other matters. All relevant statutory provisions
    are set out in Appendix A to these reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge relied on the authority of this court’s decision in <em>Griffin
    v. Dell Canada Inc.</em>, 2010 ONCA 29, 98 O.R. (3d) 481, leave to appeal
    refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 75, in deciding not to grant a partial stay
    pursuant to s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em>. The appellants assert that
    the analysis by this court in <em>Griffin</em> has been superceded or modified (I
    use the term “overtaken”) by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Seidel
    v. TELUS Communications Inc.</em>, 2011 SCC 15, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 531, and that,
    applying the reasoning in <em>Seidel</em>, a partial stay ought to have been
    granted.  The motions judge’s interpretation of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> in
    light of <em>Griffin</em> and <em>Seidel</em> is therefore at issue in this
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Griffin</em> involved a proposed class action on behalf of
    purchasers of Dell computers. Dell’s standard form agreement contained a
    mandatory arbitration clause. The motion judge refused Dell’s request to stay
    the class action in favour of arbitration and granted conditional
    certification. A five-judge panel of this court concluded that the <em>Consumer
    Protection Act</em> applied to exclude the application of Dell’s arbitration
    clause to all consumer claims after a specified date. The panel also refused to
    grant a partial stay of the non-consumer claims on the basis of s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration
    Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, concluding that it was not
    reasonable to separate the matters dealt with in the agreement from the other
    matters in the action</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Seidel</em> concerned a dispute arising out of a cell phone contract
    between TELUS Communications Inc. and one of its customers who sought to bring
    a class action. The contract contained a mandatory arbitration clause. A
    majority of the Supreme Court concluded that, based on the combined effect of
    s. 3 and s. 172 of the<i> <em>Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act</em></i>,
    S.B.C. 2004, c. 2 (“<em>BPCPA</em>”), Ms. Seidel’s claims under s. 172 could
    proceed in court despite the arbitration clause and that the stay imposed by
    the court below would be lifted in respect of those claims, and remain in place
    for the other claims in the action, which, pursuant to the parties’ agreement,
    were required to be arbitrated.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow I conclude that the motions judge was
    correct in applying <em>Griffin</em> to determine whether a partial stay of
    proceedings should be granted under s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act </em>in
    a proposed class proceeding involving both consumer and business customer
    claims. While both <em>Griffin</em> and <em>Seidel</em> involved arbitration
    clauses in the context of a proposed class proceeding, <em>Seidel</em> was
    decided under the relevant laws of British Columbia (“B.C.”), which differ in
    material ways from those of Ontario. <i>Seidel</i> emphasizes that, in
    determining whether a court action can proceed in the face of an agreement to
    arbitrate, it is essential to consider the legislation that applies in the
    relevant jurisdiction. <em>Griffin</em> remains good law in respect of
    proceedings commenced in Ontario, and has not been overtaken by <i>Seidel</i>.
    As such, I would not interfere with the motions judge’s refusal to stay the
    claims of business customers and hence her inclusion of such customers in the
    certified class. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:none'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <h2><span style='color:black'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nature of the Class Action </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent is the representative plaintiff in a class proceeding
    against TELUS Mobility concerning allegations that the mobile service provider
    engaged in an undisclosed billing practice of rounding up calls to the next
    minute. The class consists of some two million subscribers. Seventy percent are
    consumers who purchased TELUS Mobility plans for personal use, and thirty percent
    are non-consumers who purchased plans for business use.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mobile services were introduced in Canada in 1985. Until the mid-1990s,
    the major telecommunications companies in Canada billed for voice services on a
    per-minute basis. In 1996 (with the introduction of digital cell networks),
    service providers started billing on a per-second basis. In the summer of 2002,
    TELUS Mobility and others returned to per-minute billing for all new cell phone
    plans.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The monthly plans offered during the proposed class period included a
    fixed number of minutes for a set fee, with additional charges for excess
    minutes. Usage was calculated by rounding up customer calls to the next minute
    – so, for example, a one-minute, two-second call was rounded up to two minutes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The representative plaintiff alleges that during the class period,
    between 2002 and 2010, TELUS Mobility’s standard terms and conditions made no
    mention of rounding up. In July 2010, TELUS Mobility amended its standard terms
    and conditions to provide: “The airtime for each voice call is rounded up to
    the nearest minute, unless your rate plan… states otherwise.” The distribution
    of this notice marked the end of the class period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three causes of action are asserted: breach of contract, breach of the <em>Consumer
    Protection Act</em>, and unjust enrichment. The action claims $500 million in
    damages and $20 million in punitive damages on behalf of the class. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All TELUS Mobility contracts during the material time contained standard
    terms and conditions, including a clause requiring mediation and, failing
    resolution, arbitration of any disputes other than in respect of the collection
    of accounts by TELUS Mobility (the “Arbitration Agreement”). </p>
  <h2><span style='color:black'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Decision of the Motions Judge</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two motions before the motions judge: a motion to certify a
    class proceeding under s. 5 of the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O.
    1992, c. 6 (the “<em>Class Proceedings Act</em>”), and a motion by the
    appellants to stay the proceeding with respect to the claims of the
    non-consumer or business customers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge certified the class to include both consumers and
    non-consumers. In refusing to stay the claims of non-consumers, she applied s.
    7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> and the decision of this court in <em>Griffin</em>,
    which she concluded had not been overtaken by the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    decision in <em>Seidel</em>. She dealt with the issue raised in this appeal at
    paras. 82 to 91 of her decision. At paras. 88-89 she stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I cannot agree with TELUS’ submission that <em>Griffin</em> was
    overruled by <em>Seidel</em>. In <em>Seidel</em>, the Supreme Court of Canada
    addressed only the issue of whether s. 172 of the <em>BPCPA</em> constituted a
    legislative override of the arbitration clause. There was no equivalent of s.
    7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act, 1991</em> before the court. There was no issue
    of whether that statutory provision permits the court to allow claims to be
    litigated in a class action, notwithstanding the existence of an arbitration
    clause. The court was not called upon to analyze that issue. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In Ontario, s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act, 1991</em> expressly grants the court the discretion to determine whether it is reasonable
    to separate the matters dealt with in an arbitration agreement from the other
    matters in the litigation. If the court does not consider it reasonable to
    separate them and refuses the partial stay, all matters may proceed in the
    litigation, regardless of the arbitration clause. Pursuant to <em>Griffin</em>,
    this discretion may be exercised to allow non-consumer claims (that are
    otherwise subject to an arbitration clause) to participate in a class action,
    where it is reasonable to do so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motions judge concluded that the consumer claims represented 70
    percent of the total number of claims, that the liability and damages issues
    for both consumer and non-consumers would be the same, that there was no group
    arbitration permitted for the non-consumer claims, and that separating the two
    proceedings could lead to inefficiency, risk inconsistent results and create a
    multiplicity of proceedings (at para. 90). As a result, she determined that it
    would be unreasonable to separate the consumer and non-consumer claims, and
    therefore she declined to stay the non-consumer claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court dismissed a motion for leave to appeal the
    certification order: <em>sub nom</em>, <em>Corless v. Bell Mobility Inc.</em>,
    2015 ONSC 7682, [2015] O.J. No. 6661. </p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:none'>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ISSUE ON APPEAL</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants sought and were denied leave to have this appeal heard by
    a five-judge panel to reconsider this court’s decision in <em>Griffin</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on appeal is therefore restricted to whether the analysis in <em>Griffin</em> has been overtaken by the analysis mandated by <em>Seidel</em>. In particular,
    did the motions judge err in failing to apply <em>Seidel</em>, and err in
    deciding that, pursuant to <em>Griffin</em>, she retained the discretion to
    refuse a stay of the claims governed by the Arbitration Agreement? The
    appellants do not argue with how the discretion was exercised by the motions
    judge in the event this court finds that <em>Griffin</em> applies.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the significance of <em>Griffin</em> and <em>Seidel</em> to
    the resolution of this appeal, I will review these decisions, and the history
    leading up to them, in some detail before examining the parties’ submissions
    and analyzing each of them in turn.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship between arbitration clauses and class actions has been
    the subject of numerous legal proceedings. A review of cases leading up to <em>Griffin</em> and <em>Seidel</em> provides context for understanding what was at issue and
    what was decided in those cases. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2004, a five-judge panel of the B.C. Court of Appeal addressed the
    issue of whether an arbitration clause in a contract was
    &quot;inoperative&quot; under the <em>Commercial Arbitration Act</em>, R.S.B.C.
    1996, c. 55 (the “<em>Commercial Arbitration Act</em>”)<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a>  where an action challenging
    the contract was brought as an intended class proceeding: <em>MacKinnon v. National
    Money Mart Co.</em>, 2004 BCCA 473, 203 B.C.A.C. 103 (C.A.) (“<em>MacKinnon
    BCCA 2004</em>”). A year later, this court dealt with a similar case where the
    defendant sought a stay of a proposed class action based on an arbitration
    clause: <em>Smith v. National Money Mart Co.</em> (2005), 258 D.L.R. (4th) 453 (C.A.),
    leave to appeal refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 528 (“<em>Smith ONCA 2005</em>”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under both Ontario and B.C. statutes governing class proceedings, the
    court must certify a class proceeding if all the statutory criteria are met,
    including that the class proceeding would be the preferable procedure for the
    resolution of the common issues: <em>Class Proceedings Act</em>, s. 5; <em>Class
    Proceedings Act</em>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 50, s. 4. Both courts in <em>MacKinnon
    BCCA 2004 </em>and <em>Smith ONCA 2005 </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>held </span></em>that whether a stay should be granted in favour of arbitration is
    determined as part of the preferable procedure analysis on a motion for
    certification. The courts reasoned that, if a class proceeding is considered
    the preferable procedure for resolving the dispute and the action is certified
    as a class action, the arbitration agreement falls within an exception to the
    stay mandated by the domestic arbitration statutes of Ontario and B.C. and is
    rendered “invalid” in Ontario and “inoperative” in B.C.: <em>Arbitration Act</em>,
    s. 7(2); <em>Commercial Arbitration Act</em>, s. 15. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two years later, the Supreme Court decided two cases from Québec: <em>Dell
    Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs</em>, 2007 SCC 34, [2007] 2 S.C.R.
    801 (“<em>Dell</em>”), and <em>Rogers Wireless Inc. v. Muroff</em>, 2007 SCC
    35, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 921 (“<em>Rogers Wireless</em>”). They dealt with the
    relationship between arbitration clauses and class actions under the <em>Civil
    Code of Québec</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> S.Q. 1991,
    c. 64 and the <em>Code of Civil Procedure</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>R.S.Q. c. C-25.</span></em><a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The Supreme Court rejected attempts by consumers to pursue class actions in
    Québec in the face of arbitration clauses. Among other things, the Supreme
    Court emphasized that arbitration clauses confer substantive rights that are
    not affected by the procedural right to bring a claim by way of a class
    proceeding, and that a challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction or to the
    validity or applicability of the arbitration agreement should be resolved by
    the arbitrator, except where the challenge is based solely on a question of law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em>, renewed motions for a
    stay were brought in the <i>Smith</i> and <i>MacKinnon</i> cases: <em>Smith
    Estate v. National Money Mart Co.</em> (2008), 57 C.P.C. (6th) 99 (S.C.) (“<em>Smith
    Estate ONSC 2008</em>”); <em>MacKinnon v. National Money Mart Company</em>,
    2008 BCSC 710, 293<span style='font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;color:black;
background:white'> </span>D.L.R. (4th) 478 (“<em>MacKinnon BCSC 2008</em>”).
    Both courts dismissed the motions, concluding that <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers
    Wireless</em> had limited application in Ontario and B.C. because the Supreme
    Court had dealt with Québec legislation and did not purport to interpret the
    legislation of other provinces. The courts also concluded that issue estoppel
    applied. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A five-judge panel of this court dismissed an appeal from <em>Smith
    Estate ONSC 2008 </em>on the basis of issue estoppel and this court found it
    unnecessary to decide whether <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em> changed the law in Ontario: <i>S<em>mith Estate v. National Money Mart Co.</em></i>,
    2008 ONCA 746, 92 O.R. (3d) 641, leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No.
    535 (“<em>Smith Estate ONCA 2008</em>”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As will be discussed below, a five-judge panel of the B.C. Court of
    Appeal also dismissed the appeal of <em>MacKinnon BCSC 2008 </em>on the basis
    of issue estoppel, although the court concluded that <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers
    Wireless</em> changed the law in B.C. and effectively overruled its earlier
    decision in <em>MacKinnon BCCA 2004</em>: <em>MacKinnon v. National Money Mart
    Co.</em>, 2009 BCCA 103, 304 D.L.R. (4th) 331 (“<em>MacKinnon BCCA 2009</em>”).
    This case was heard alongside the companion case of <em>Seidel v. TELUS

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Griffin</em> was an appeal of two orders of Lax J., who was case
    managing a proposed class proceeding that arose from the sale of allegedly
    defective Dell notebook computers. The first order dismissed Dell’s motion for
    a stay of proceedings based on the mandatory arbitration clause in Dell’s
    standard contract, and certified the action as a class proceeding: (2009), 72
    C.P.C. (6th) 158 (S.C.). The second order dismissed a motion brought by Dell
    for reconsideration of that decision: (2009), 76 C.P.C. (6th) 173 (S.C.), aff’d
    2010 ONCA 29, 98 O.R. (3d) 481. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lax J. dismissed a motion for a stay of proceedings, following the
    approach in <em>Smith ONCA 2005</em> and <em>MacKinnon BCCA 2004</em>.  She
    rejected the argument that the landscape in Ontario had been altered by <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em><i>. </i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lax J. cited with approval <em>Smith Estate ONSC 2008</em> and <em>MacKinnon
    BCSC 2008</em>.  She concluded that since <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em> were decided on the basis of Québec law, the decisions did not apply to
    Ontario, and the appropriate course of action was to consider the validity of
    the arbitration clause in the context of the preferability analysis on the
    certification motion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Lax J. held that it was unnecessary to determine whether ss. 7
    and 8 of the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em> applied to the claims in the
    proposed proceeding, where some purchasers had acquired their computers before the
    Act came into force on July 30, 2005. These sections preclude the mandatory
    application of arbitration clauses to consumer contracts and permit class
    proceedings notwithstanding any contractual provisions to the contrary.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration was brought after a five-judge panel of the
    B.C. Court of Appeal released its companion decisions in <em>MacKinnon BCCA
    2009</em> and <em>Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc.</em>, 2009 BCCA 104, 267
    B.C.A.C. 266, where the B.C. Court of Appeal concluded that <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers
    Wireless </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>changed the law in B.C. and
    effectively overruled earlier appellate authority on the relationship between
    arbitration and class actions</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lax J. dismissed the reconsideration motion after carefully considering
    the reasoning in the B.C. Court of Appeal cases and explaining why she
    preferred the analysis of Perell J. in <em>Smith Estate ONSC 2008</em>, which
    contrasted the legislation in Ontario with that in Québec. She maintained that <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em><i> </i>do not apply in Ontario and that in this
    province whether or not to stay a class proceeding is to be determined within
    the context of the preferable procedure analysis in a certification motion.</p>
  <h4>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Griffin</i> in the Court of Appeal</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A five-judge panel of this court heard the appeal in <em>Griffin</em><i> </i>because the appellant was challenging the continued authority of <em>Smith
    ONCA 2005</em> in light of <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em>, and in
    particular this court’s holding that the legality of an arbitration provision
    should be determined at the certification hearing and that it is premature to
    attempt to stay the action beforehand. However, this court did not decide this
    issue in <em>Griffin</em>, nor has the issue been decided in Ontario at the
    appellate level since that time. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather, the appeal was determined based on the exercise of the court’s
    discretion under s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> in the context of an
    action in which both consumer claims and non-consumer claims were asserted.
    Section 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The court may stay the proceeding with respect to the matters
    dealt with in the arbitration agreement and allow it to continue with respect
    to other matters if it finds that,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) the agreement deals with only some of the matters in
    respect of which the proceeding was commenced; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) it is reasonable to separate the matters dealt with in the
    agreement from the other matters.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A., writing for a unanimous court, noted that, in the
    certification decision, a second representative plaintiff who was a consumer
    had been added and that s. 7 of the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em> was
    therefore engaged. Section 7 provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>7(1) The substantive and procedural rights given under this Act
    apply despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), any term
    or acknowledgment in a consumer agreement or a related agreement that requires
    or has the effect of requiring that disputes arising out of the consumer
    agreement be submitted to arbitration is invalid insofar as it prevents a
    consumer from exercising a right to commence an action in the Superior Court of
    Justice given under this Act.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) Despite subsections (1) and (2), after a dispute over which
    a consumer may commence an action in the Superior Court of Justice arises, the
    consumer, the supplier and any other person involved in the dispute may agree
    to resolve the dispute using any procedure that is available in law.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) A settlement or decision that results from the procedure
    agreed to under subsection (3) is as binding on the parties as such a
    settlement or decision would be if it were reached in respect of a dispute
    concerning an agreement to which this Act does not apply.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(5) Subsection 7 (1) of the&nbsp;<em>Arbitration Act, 1991</em>&nbsp;does
    not apply in respect of any proceeding to which subsection (2) applies unless,
    after the dispute arises, the consumer agrees to submit the dispute to
    arbitration.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A. concluded that s. 7 applied to the consumer claims because
    the alleged breaches occurred after July 30, 2005 when the <em>Consumer
    Protection Act</em> came into force. The result was that the arbitration clause
    would be invalid to prevent a court action in respect of consumer claims and
    therefore all consumer claims would proceed to litigation despite the existence
    of an arbitration agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A. then turned to the question of whether a partial stay of the
    non-consumer claims should be granted. He noted that s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration
    Act</em> confers a discretion to grant a partial stay where an action involves
    some claims that are subject to arbitration and some that are not, and where it
    is reasonable to separate the matters dealt with in the agreement from the
    other matters. He applied the reasoning from a line of cases where claims by or
    against multiple parties were asserted, only some of which were subject to
    arbitration and a partial stay of proceedings had been refused: <em>Radewych v.
    Brookfield Homes (Ontario) Ltd.</em>, [2007] O.J. No. 2483 (S.C.), aff’d 2007
    ONCA 721, [2007] O.J. No. 4012, <em>Johnston v. Mlakar</em> (2006), 212 O.A.C.
    79 (C.A.), <i>Frambordeaux Developments Inc. v. Romandale Farms Ltd</i>.,
    [2007] O.J. No. 4917 (S.C.), and <i>New Era Nutrition Inc. v. Balance Bar Co.</i>,
    2004 ABCA 280, 357 A.R. 184 (involving a provision in Alberta’s domestic
    arbitration statute identical to s. 7(5) of Ontario’s <i>Arbitration Act</i>). Sharpe
    J.A. concluded that it would not be reasonable to separate the consumer claims
    from the non-consumer claims, as this would result in added cost and delay, as
    well as a multiplicity of proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharpe J.A. also noted, at para. 52, that the motion judge’s finding
    that claims could not be efficiently litigated through the arbitration process
    was “another factor supporting the conclusion that it would not be reasonable
    to grant a partial stay.” He observed that there was considerable evidence in
    the record to support this finding, and no evidence from Dell “to indicate that
    the arbitration of [the] claims would be anything other than cost-prohibitive”
    (at para. 56). He noted that it was “clear beyond any serious doubt on this
    record that staying any claims advanced in the action [would] not result in any
    of the stayed claims being arbitrated,” and that the real choice was “between
    clothing Dell with immunity from liability for defective goods sold to
    non-consumers and giving those purchasers the same day in court afforded to
    consumers by way of the class proceeding” (at para. 57). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Sharpe J.A. concluded that it was unnecessary to decide whether <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em> applied in Ontario and had overruled <em>Smith ONCA 2005</em>. He stated, at para. 64:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As I have concluded that the [<em>Consumer Protection Act</em>]
    applies to the claim of the representative plaintiff Andrews and that a partial
    stay of the claim of the representative plaintiff Griffin should be refused, it
    is not necessary for me to decide whether, apart from the [<em>Consumer
    Protection Act</em>], <em>Dell</em> would have applied in Ontario… To the
    extent that the application of <em>Dell</em> does remain a live issue, we are
    likely to receive further guidance from the Supreme Court of Canada when it
    decides the appeal in [<em>Seidel</em>].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in <em>Griffin</em>, it was unnecessary for this court to
    revisit earlier decisions that dealt with the issue of whether a certification
    motion was the proper context to determine whether a claim should be stayed in
    favour of arbitration. This was unnecessary because of the Ontario legislation:
    the combined effect of the recently enacted provisions of the <i>Consumer
    Protection Act</i>, which provided that mandatory arbitration did not apply to
    consumer claims, and the discretion of the court to grant a partial stay of
    proceedings where the action involves some claims that are subject to
    arbitration and some claims that are not under s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration
    Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court refused leave to appeal this court’s decision in <em>Griffin</em>:
    [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 75.</p>
  <h3><span lang=FR-CA>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span lang=FR-CA>Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc. </span></i></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, in <em>Seidel</em> the plaintiff sought to certify a class
    action against TELUS for alleged unfair billing practices (in that case,
    charging customers for the time it took to connect a call). The action included
    claims by consumers and business customers who had signed the same standard
    contract containing a mandatory arbitration clause. Various claims were
    asserted in the action, including some invoking rights, benefits or protections
    under the <em>BPCPA</em>. The defendant moved for a stay of proceedings based
    on the arbitration clause. The question was whether the arbitration clause was
    “inoperative”, which was a ground for refusing to stay court proceedings under
    s. 15 of the B.C. <em>Commercial Arbitration Act</em>. </p>
  <h4>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Seidel</i> at First Instance </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the matter came before the B.C. Supreme Court, the underlying issue
    was characterized as whether <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em> had
    overtaken <em>MacKinnon BCCA 2004</em>: <em>Seidel v. Telus Communications Inc.</em>,
    2008 BCSC 933, 295 D.L.R. (4th) 511. The defendant had applied for a stay on
    the basis that <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em> required that an
    arbitrator determine the applicability of an arbitration clause prior to a
    certification hearing. After a detailed comparison of the statutory context in
    B.C. with that in Québec, and adopting the analysis of Perell J. in <em>Smith
    Estate ONSC 2008</em>, the court concluded that <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers
    Wireless</em> had not changed the law in B.C. </p>
  <h4>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Seidel</i> in the B.C. Court of Appeal </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above<i>, <em>Seidel</em></i> went to a five-judge panel of the
    B.C. Court of Appeal and was argued together with an appeal of <em>MacKinnon
    BCSC 2008</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court compared the B.C. and Québec arbitrations and class
    proceedings legislation, and concluded that <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers
    Wireless</em> had overruled its earlier decision in <em>MacKinnon BCCA 2004</em>.
    In <em>Seidel</em>, the court also observed that a class action is a procedural
    vehicle that does not modify the substantive rights created by an arbitration
    clause.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court rejected the argument that the arbitration clause was
    inoperative because of s. 3 of the <em>BPCPA</em>. Section 3 renders void any
    waiver or release of any rights, benefits or protections under the <em>BPCPA</em>,
    including the statutory remedy contained in s. 172 of the <em>BPCPA</em>, which
    allows a person other than a supplier to bring an action in the Supreme Court
    to enforce the statute’s consumer protection standards. The court concluded
    that ss. 3 and 172 of the <em>BPCPA</em> did not exclude arbitral jurisdiction
    and did not render the arbitration agreement between Ms. Seidel and TELUS
    inoperative. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court also determined that the action should be stayed in favour of
    an arbitrator determining at first instance which claims would be subject to
    arbitration and which, if any, would not. </p>
  <h4>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Seidel</i> in the Supreme Court of Canada </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority opinion (with four judges concurring) was written by Binnie
    J. In contrast to how the matter had been addressed at first instance and in
    the Court of Appeal, he approached the matter largely as a question of
    statutory interpretation. Binnie J. stated, at para. 2: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The choice to restrict or not to restrict arbitration clauses
    in consumer contracts is a matter for the legislature.&nbsp; Absent legislative
    intervention, the courts will generally give effect to the terms of a
    commercial contract freely entered into, even a contract of adhesion, including
    an arbitration clause. <u>The important question raised by this appeal,
    however, is whether the <span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>BPCPA</span> manifests a legislative intent to intervene in the marketplace to relieve
    consumers of their contractual commitment to “private and confidential”
    mediation/arbitration and, if so, under what circumstances</u>. [Emphasis

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority found that an arbitration clause will prevail “absent
    legislative intervention” and that the provisions of the <em>BPCPA</em> demonstrated an intent to intervene to relieve consumers of their arbitration
    agreements. The court concluded that the combined effect of ss. 3 and 172 of
    the <em>BPCPA</em> was to allow claims asserted under s. 172 to proceed in
    court despite an arbitration clause. The court came to this conclusion in part
    because the features of private arbitration – confidentiality, lack of
    precedential value and the avoidance of publicity – are incompatible with the legislature’s
    objectives and undermine the effectiveness of the remedy set out at s. 172 (at
    para. 38).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Binnie J. held that, to the extent that Ms. Seidel’s claims invoked the
    remedies under the <em>BPCPA</em>, including declaratory and injunctive relief,
    those claims must be allowed to proceed in the superior court. However, the
    claims that were not covered by the <em>BPCPA</em>, including common law
    claims, continued to be governed by the arbitration clause. He stated at para.
    7: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Private arbitral justice, because of its contractual origins,
    is necessarily limited.&nbsp; As the <em>BPCPA</em> recognizes, some types of
    relief can only be made available from a superior court.&nbsp; Accordingly, to
    the extent Ms. Seidel’s complaints shelter under s. 172 of the <em>BPCPA</em> (and only to that extent), they cannot be waived by an arbitration clause and
    her court action may continue, in my opinion.&nbsp; As to her alternative complaints,
    whether under other sections of the <em>BPCPA</em>, the now repealed <em>Trade
    Practice Act</em>, or at common law, the TELUS arbitration clause is valid and
    enforceable.&nbsp; As to those claims, her court action should be stayed
    pursuant to s. 15 of the&nbsp;<em>Commercial Arbitration Act</em>. [Citations

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the court accepted that bifurcated proceedings could
    result from its order, with the s. 172 claims proceeding in a court action and
    the other claims, if pursued, going to arbitration. Binnie J. stated that such
    an outcome was “consistent with the legislative choice made by British Columbia
    in drawing the boundaries of s. 172 as narrowly as it did” (at para. 50). It
    was only to the extent that the plaintiff could bring her case within s. 172 of
    the <em>BPCPA</em> that the “legislative override” in s. 3 would “extricate her
    from the arbitration clause to which she agreed in the TELUS contract” (at

    Code of Québec</em>” (at para. 41), the “relevant teaching” of those cases “is
    simply that whether and to what extent the parties’ freedom to arbitrate is
    limited or curtailed by legislation will depend on a close examination of the
    law of the forum where the irate customers have commenced their court case. <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers Wireless</em> stand… for the enforcement of arbitration clauses <u>absent

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, there is one issue on this appeal – whether this court’s
    analysis in <em>Griffin</em> has been overtaken by the Supreme Court’s analysis
    in <em>Seidel</em>. The appellants make three main arguments in support of
    their position that <em>Seidel</em> applies and that, following <em>Seidel</em>,
    the non-consumer claims should be stayed. I will address each argument in turn.</p>
  <h3>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Seidel</i> Did Not Overtake <i>Griffin</i></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants assert that <em>Griffin</em> has been overtaken by <em>Seidel</em> in part because of the different attitudes toward arbitration expressed in each
    case, which is reflected in their different outcomes – the bifurcation of
    consumer and non-consumer claims in <em>Seidel</em> and not in <em>Griffin</em>.
    They say <em>Seidel</em> affirms the legitimacy of arbitration and requires
    courts to give effect to arbitration clauses, even in contracts of adhesion,
    and even if this leads to a bifurcation of proceedings, unless the legislature
    provides otherwise. They argue that neither s. 7 of the <em>Consumer Protection
    Act </em>(which relates only to consumer claims) nor s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration
    Act </em>provides a clear “legislative override”, such that the non-consumer
    claims escape the Arbitration Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, on the other hand, asserts that <em>Seidel</em> is distinguishable
    as it was decided in the context of B.C.’s arbitration and consumer protection
    legislation. There is no equivalent in B.C. to s. 7(5) of Ontario’s <em>Arbitration
    Act</em>. As such, <i>Seidel</i> does not overtake or alter the authority of <em>Griffin</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent also argues that, applying the test articulated in <em>Seidel</em>,
    the legislative intent to intervene in consensual arbitration is found both in
    the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em> in respect of consumer claims, and in the
    discretion provided under the <em>Arbitration Act</em> that permits the court
    to refuse a stay of proceedings in favour of arbitration in specified
    circumstances, including under s. 7(5) where some claims are covered by an
    arbitration agreement, and it would be unreasonable to separate the matters
    covered by the arbitration clause from those which are not. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree that <em>Seidel</em> has not overtaken or altered the authority
    of <em>Griffin</em>, as <em>Griffin</em> is consistent in principle with <em>Seidel</em> but was decided in a different legislative context. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The outcomes in the two cases were driven, not by competing attitudes
    toward arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism, but by the specific
    legislative framework in each jurisdiction respecting arbitration and consumer
    protection.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Seidel</em> recognizes the value and importance of private
    arbitration for dispute resolution, and that arbitration clauses will generally
    be upheld. As I have noted, Binnie J. specifically stated at para. 2 that
    courts will generally give effect to contracts freely entered into by the
    parties, even a contract of adhesion that includes an arbitration clause.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Griffin</em> does not contradict the general principle that
    contractual arbitration clauses presumptively will be enforced. See, for
    example: <em>Ontario Hydro v. Denison Mines Ltd.</em>, 1992 CarswellOnt 3497
    (W.L. Can.), [1992] O.J. No. 2948 (Gen. Div.), at para. 9, W.L. Can., <em>Inforica
    Inc. v. C.G.I. Information Systems and Management Consultants Inc.</em>, 2009
    ONCA 642, 97 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 14, and <em>Haas v. Gunasekaram</em>, 2016
    ONCA 744, [2016] O.J. No. 5286, at paras. 10-12. The decision in <i>Griffin</i>,<i> </i>to permit all claims to proceed in court together, was not premised on a
    disregard for arbitration as a viable dispute resolution mechanism but on the
    application of the discretion afforded by s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>and the conclusion that a partial stay of
    non-consumer claims would be unreasonable where a majority of claims asserted
    in the action were non-arbitrable consumer claims and where the mot</span></em>ion
    judge found that the non-consumer claims could not be efficiently litigated
    through the arbitration process. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting the primacy of arbitration over judicial proceedings where the
    parties have a contractual agreement to arbitrate does not alter the <em>Griffin</em> analysis or the disposition of the present appeal. Rather, both <em>Seidel</em> and <em>Griffin</em> accept that arbitration agreements will generally be
    enforced, that any restriction of the parties’ freedom to arbitrate must be
    found in the legislation of the jurisdiction, and that the ability of the court
    to interfere with this freedom depends on the legislative context.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In effect, the appellants seek to apply the result in <em>Seidel</em> –
    a bifurcation of proceedings – while ignoring the material differences between
    the Ontario and B.C. consumer protection and domestic arbitration legislation.
    It is to that legislation that I now turn.</p>
  <h4>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consumer Protection Legislation</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, there are material differences in the consumer protection
    legislation of Ontario and B.C. respecting court proceedings. Arbitration
    clauses in consumer contracts have been unenforceable in Ontario since the <em>Consumer
    Protection Act </em>came into force on July 30, 2005. Section 7 is an express
    provision that exempts consumer contracts from mandatory arbitration. In <em>Seidel</em> terms, this constitutes an express legislative override of the parties’ freedom
    to choose arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no equivalent to s. 7 in the <em>BPCPA</em>. Rather, s. 172 of
    the <em>BPCPA</em>, which provides for a cause of action that can be asserted
    in the superior court, and s. 3, which prohibits contracting out of statutory
    rights, were interpreted together in <em>Seidel</em> as providing a legislative
    override of the parties’ freedom to choose arbitration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Binnie J. highlighted the fact that his decision was firmly based on the
    specific provisions of B.C. law. He noted that, in enacting s. 172 of the <em>BPCPA</em>,
    B.C.’s legislature sought to ensure only that certain claims proceed in the
    court system and that, in contrast, the legislatures of Ontario and Québec “decided
    to ban arbitration of consumer claims altogether” through consumer protection
    legislation. He explained that “it is incumbent on the courts to give effect to
    that legislative choice” (at para. 40). </p>
  <h4>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Domestic Arbitration Legislation</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second important difference between the law in B.C. and Ontario is
    in their domestic arbitration legislation, and in particular, the legislature’s
    tolerance for court intervention in private contractual arbitrations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B.C.’s <em>Commercial Arbitration Act</em> provides for a very limited
    right of the courts to intervene in arbitration. Section 15 restricts
    intervention to circumstances in which the arbitration agreement is “void,
    inoperative or incapable of being performed”. This section was changed two
    years after the B.C. legislation was enacted, to reflect the wording of article
    8 of the UNCITRAL <i>Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</i>,
    U.N. Doc. A/40/17 (1985), Ann. 1.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> Ontario, by contrast, only adopted the UNCITRAL model law for international arbitrations
    through the enactment of the <em>International Commercial Arbitration Act,</em> <em>2017</em>, S.O. 2017, c. 2, Sched. 5, and its predecessor R.S.O. 1990, c.
    I.9. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario’s <em>Arbitration Act</em>, which governs domestic arbitrations,
    provides broader authority for the court’s intervention in arbitrations than
    legislation enacted based on the UNCITRAL model law. Ontario’s legislation is
    based on a model law created by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada (“ULCC”)
    in 1990. Section 7 of the <em>Uniform Arbitration Act (1990)</em> deals with
    stays of court proceedings.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While s. 7(1) of Ontario’s <em>Arbitration Act</em> provides that a
    court “shall” stay a court proceeding commenced by a party to an arbitration
    agreement on the motion of another party to the agreement, this is subject to
    the exceptions set out in s. 7(2). The exceptions confer a discretion on the
    court to intervene: (1) where a party entered into the agreement while under a
    legal incapacity, (2) where the arbitration agreement is invalid, (3) where the
    subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of being the subject of
    arbitration under Ontario law, (4) where the motion was brought with undue
    delay, and (5) where the matter is a proper one for default or summary
    judgment. The grounds upon which a court may intervene in domestic arbitrations
    in Ontario by refusing to stay a court proceeding are broader than the grounds
    for intervention provided for under s. 15 of the B.C. legislation. Ontario’s
    legislation permits the court to consider the conduct of a defendant who fails
    to move promptly to stay a court proceeding and to consider the substance of
    the claim to determine whether default or summary judgment would be
    appropriate.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> is an extension of the
    court’s discretion and operates where an action has been commenced and the
    arbitration agreement covers some, but not all, claims. In such a case, the
    court may grant a partial stay, but only where it is “reasonable to separate
    the matters dealt with in the agreement from the other matters.” Section 7(5)
    anticipates that when an action contains claims that are subject to an
    arbitration agreement and claims that are not, bifurcated proceedings will
    result when it is reasonable to impose a partial stay. When a partial stay is
    not reasonable, the proceedings will not be bifurcated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Ontario, accordingly, courts have the discretion to refuse to enforce
    an arbitration clause that covers some claims in an action when other claims
    are not subject to domestic arbitration. It is this legislative choice that drives
    the analysis. The bifurcation of proceedings in <em>Seidel</em> resulted from
    B.C.’s statutory scheme and was described as “an outcome…consistent with the
    legislative choice made by British Columbia in drawing the boundaries of s. 172
    as narrowly as it did”: <em>Seidel</em>, at para. 50. One might add that the
    bifurcation of proceedings in <em>Seidel</em> also resulted from the absence of
    a discretion similar to that granted to courts pursuant to s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration
    Act</em> in B.C.’s arbitration legislation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A recent case in Manitoba considered whether <em>Seidel</em> requires a
    different approach to the question of “reasonableness” in stay applications in
    class proceedings where only some claims are arbitrable: <em>Briones v.
    National Money Mart</em>, 2013 MBQB 168, 295 Man. R. (2d) 101. <em>Briones</em> involved a proposed class action that included consumer protection claims under <i>T<em>he Consumer Protection Act</em></i>, C.C.S.M., c. C200, and <em>The</em> <em>Unconscionable Transactions Act</em>, C.C.S.M., c. U20, that the court
    interpreted as non-arbitrable, and other claims, which were subject to the
    arbitration clause. The defendant applied for a partial stay of proceedings
    under s. 7(5) of <em>The Arbitration Act</em>, C.C.S.M., c. A120 (the
    equivalent to Ontario’s s. 7(5)), asserting that, following <em>Seidel</em> and
    its express approval of bifurcated proceedings, it would be “reasonable” to
    grant a partial stay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Queen’s Bench denied a partial stay on the basis that,
    having regard to the overlapping matters that could not be reasonably
    separated, the undesirability and inefficiency of multiple proceedings, and the
    risk of inconsistent results, it would not be reasonable to separate the
    matters subject to arbitration from other matters in the litigation. The court expressly
    referred to and followed the approach in <em>Griffin</em>. The court concluded
    that “there was no issue in <em>Seidel</em> as to whether a partial stay should
    be granted as the [B.C. legislation] did not have a provision equivalent to s.
    7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Acts</em> of Manitoba, Alberta, and Ontario” (at
    para. 62). This decision was upheld by the Manitoba Court of Appeal as a
    reasonable exercise of the motion judge’s discretion: 2014 MBCA 57, 306 Man. R.
    (2d) 129, at para. 42, leave to appeal refused, [2014] SCCA No. 355.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the reasoning in <em>Briones</em> and the position of the
    respondent in this appeal. The differences between the legislation of Ontario
    and B.C. account for the different approaches in <em>Griffin</em> and <em>Seidel</em> to the bifurcation of proceedings where some claims are subject to an
    arbitration agreement and some are not. In Ontario, the legislature chose to
    exempt consumer claims from mandatory arbitration and, in the domestic context,
    to provide the court with the discretion to determine whether it is reasonable
    to separate matters subject to an arbitration clause from other matters in the
    litigation. The combination of these legislative provisions, which differ from
    those in B.C., drove the result in <em>Griffin</em> as well as the result in
    this case.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants<i> </i>also rely on <em>Seidel</em> to advance what was
    one of their central arguments before this court. They contend that <em>Seidel</em><i> </i>confirms that the procedural device of a class proceeding does not alter
    the parties’ substantive right to arbitrate and does not give the court
    jurisdiction over claims required to be submitted to arbitration. Further, the
    appellants argue that, in light of <em>Seidel</em>, s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration
    Act</em> cannot be read as “conferring jurisdiction” over claims the parties
    have agreed to submit to arbitration and that such claims are subject to the
    mandatory stay provision in s. 7(1).</p>

    2006 SCC 19, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 666, where a class action commenced by a unionized
    employee was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The court found the procedural
    vehicle of a class proceeding to be incompatible with the exclusive
    jurisdiction of grievance arbitrators over the dispute in question. LeBel J.,
    for a unanimous court, described the class action as “a procedural vehicle
    whose use neither modifies nor creates substantive rights” (at para. 17). He
    stated, at para. 22: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he class action procedure cannot have the effect of
    conferring jurisdiction on the Superior Court over a group of cases that would

    Indeed, article 2638 of the <em>Civil Code of Québec</em> provides: “<span

    para. 257). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is sufficient for the purpose of this appeal to note that
    injecting the question of jurisdiction into the discussion of whether a partial
    stay of proceedings can be granted under Ontario’s <em>Arbitration Act</em> is
    both unnecessary and misleading.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the appellants’ argument that the contractual right to arbitrate
    is a “substantive right” that is unaffected by the “procedural vehicle” of a
    class proceeding, this issue simply does not arise in the present case nor was
    it the basis on which the Supreme Court of Canada decided <em>Seidel</em>.
    While this distinction informed the decisions in <em>Dell</em>, <em>Rogers
    Wireless</em> and <em>MacKinnon BCCA 2009</em>, as well as <em>Seidel</em> in
    the courts below, the majority in <em>Seidel</em> did not address the issue in
    this way. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The class proceeding context did not inform the preliminary question of
    whether Ms. Seidel’s claims should be stayed. While the question of a stay in
    favour of arbitration arose in the context of class proceedings, Binnie J.
    specifically stated that the appeal only concerned Ms. Seidel’s individual
    action and that “[w]hether or not the s. 172 claims should be certified as a
    class action is a matter that will have to be determined by the courts of
    British Columbia, which have yet to address the issue” (at para. 8). Accordingly,
    the distinction between substantive and procedural rights did not arise in and
    was irrelevant to the analysis of the majority of the court in <em>Seidel</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly in <em>Griffin</em>, this court determined the issues without
    addressing the effect of the procedural device of a class proceeding on the
    substantive rights conferred by an arbitration clause. Instead, because the
    action involved both consumer claims (which are not subject to mandatory
    arbitration pursuant to s. 7 of the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em>) and
    non-consumer claims, the issue was whether s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em> grants a court the discretion to refuse a partial stay of non-consumer claims
    so that these claims may be adjudicated alongside those of consumers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I therefore reject the appellants’ submission that the Arbitration
    Agreement ousts the jurisdiction of the court, the suggestion that one must
    look for a specific provision to confer jurisdiction before the Arbitration
    Agreement will not be given effect, and the argument that the substantive right
    to arbitrate must be given primacy over the procedural vehicle of a class
    proceeding. The question of whether the substantive right to arbitrate must be
    given effect is governed by the domestic legislation of Ontario and cannot be
    determined in a legislative vacuum as the appellants would have us do. Under
    the Ontario <i>Arbitration Act</i>, jurisdiction is specifically retained in
    the situations covered by s. 7(5) and the present situation is governed by this
    provision.</p>
  <h3>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Conflation of the Stay Issue and the Preferability Analysis </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants contend that the motions judge erred in deciding
    the issue of whether a stay should be granted in the context of a preferability
    analysis (whether a class proceeding would be the “preferable procedure” under
    s. 5(1)(d) of the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em>), and that this approach has
    been overtaken by <em>Seidel</em> and other authorities. They say that, having
    decided that a class proceeding was the “preferable procedure”, the motions
    judge then refused to enforce the arbitration clause. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent contends that, whether or not <em>Seidel</em> should be
    interpreted as overturning prior authorities such as <em>Smith ONCA 2005</em>,
    the motions judge did not deal with the stay issue as part of the preferability
    analysis on certification and therefore did not err in this regard.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the appellants’ argument mischaracterizes the motions
    judge’s decision in this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have already noted, the earlier decision of this court in <em>Smith
    ONCA 2005 </em>concluded that the issue of the enforceability of an arbitration
    clause should be determined only after the preferability analysis in a class
    proceeding certification motion. The subsequent cases of <em>Dell</em> and <em>Rogers
    Wireless</em> called that approach into question. In <em>Griffin</em>, the
    judge at first instance adopted the approach of this court in <em>Smith ONCA
    2005</em>, however, as Sharpe J.A. noted on appeal, it was unnecessary to
    determine the effect of <em>Dell</em> on cases in Ontario due to the <em>Consumer
    Protection Act</em>. By outlawing mandatory arbitration clauses in consumer
    agreements, the legislature in Ontario excluded the application of the
    reasoning in <em>Dell</em><i> </i>to agreements covered by the <em>Consumer
    Protection Act</em>: <em>Griffin</em>, at para. 64. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the motions judge in this case, although dealing with two
    motions – one to stay and the other to certify the class proceeding – did not
    approach the issue of whether to grant a stay by undertaking a preferability
    analysis, as the appellants assert. This is notwithstanding that the motions
    judge’s reasons set out her analysis and conclusions on the stay motion in a
    section under the heading “Preferable Procedure.” The issue before her was the
    same as the issue before this court in <em>Griffin</em> – because of the
    combined effect of the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em> and the <em>Arbitration
    Act</em>, she had to determine whether it was reasonable to separate the
    proceedings. Neither the motions judge in this case, nor this court in <em>Griffin</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> refused a stay of proceedings of
    arbitrable claims based on the conclusion that a class action would be a “preferable
    procedure”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present appeal, and in this court’s decision in <em>Griffin</em>,
    the question of the enforceability of the arbitration agreement was determined
    without resort to the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em>. As such, the appellants
    are wrong when they suggest that the motions judge erred in determining the
    issue as part of the preferability analysis. While this was the approach
    endorsed in <em>Griffin</em> and <em>Seidel</em> at first instance, it is not
    how the matter was determined on appeal in <em>Griffin</em>, in the Supreme
    Court in <em>Seidel</em> or by the motions judge in this case.</p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:none'>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It bears repeating that the sole issue in this appeal is whether the <em>Griffin</em> analysis and framework for determining whether a partial stay of proceedings
    should be granted has been overtaken by a new and different analysis in <em>Seidel</em>.
    There was no challenge to the exercise of the motions judge’s discretion in
    refusing a partial stay and, in particular, her assessment on the facts of this
    case, of whether it would be “reasonable” to bifurcate the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons I conclude that the motions judge did not err
    in rejecting the argument that <em>Griffin</em> has been overtaken by <em>Seidel</em> and that, applying <em>Seidel</em>, a partial stay ought to have been granted. As
    such, I would uphold the motions judge’s decision to refuse a stay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore dismiss the appeal. I would award costs to the
    respondents fixed at $30,000, the amount agreed between the parties, inclusive
    of HST and disbursements. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have had the opportunity to read the careful and thorough reasons of my
    colleague, van Rensburg J.A.  I agree with her that the appeal must be
    dismissed, but would do so on a more restricted basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I agree that this Court’s decision in <em>Griffin v. Dell Canada
    Inc.</em> has not been overtaken, or effectively overruled, by the Supreme
    Court of Canada’s later decision in <em>Seidel v. TELUS Communications Inc</em><i>.</i> 
    Secondly, while I have reservations about the correctness of the decision in <em>Griffin </em>as it relates to a partial stay of the non-consumer claims, it is binding
    on us and dispositive of the issue.</p>
  <h5><em>Seidel</em> and <em>Griffin</em></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Seidel</em> has not overtaken <em>Griffin</em> because it did not
    determine the same issues as those raised in <em>Griffin</em>.  As decided by
    the majority in the Supreme Court of Canada, <em>Seidel</em> concerned only the
    claim of Ms. Seidel as an individual consumer plaintiff.  The majority confined
    its analysis to a determination of whether the British Columbia legislative
    scheme operated as an override to her individual arbitration clause, and
    decided that it did.  The majority did not deal with the interface between
    consumer and non-consumer claims that are subject to different arbitration
    agreements, nor did it address the complication of the class action nature of
    her claim.  <em>Griffin</em> dealt squarely with those issues, and decided that
    s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act 1991</em>, S.O. 1991, c. 17 provided the
    court with a discretion in such cases to refuse to grant the mandatory stay of
    a proceeding that would otherwise flow from s. 7(1) of the <i>Act</i>.  That
    decision is binding and dispositive.</p>
  <h5><em>Griffin</em></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, this is not the place to address in detail the
    reasons why, in my respectful view, <em>Griffin </em>may not be correctly
    decided insofar as it relates to a partial stay of the non-consumer claims. 
    Suffice it to say, there are questions remaining that may warrant further
    consideration at another time and that were not fully addressed in that case. 
    Two come to mind, for example (one more specific in nature, and the other, more
    general).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as a matter of statutory interpretation, may the words “other
    matters” in s. 7(5) of the <em>Arbitration Act 1991</em> – when considered in
    the context of s. 7 as a whole and the purposes of that Act – be read in a way
    that cross-pollinates the partial-refusal-to-stay power from a single
    arbitration agreement context to other arbitration agreements involving
    different parties and containing arbitration clauses that are otherwise valid
    and enforceable?  Or do “other matters” refer to other matters arising between
    the same contracting parties but that are not covered by the arbitration
    agreement between them? One of the purposes of the <em>Arbitration Act 1991</em> is to encourage parties to resolve their disputes through private arbitration
    proceedings and to support their agreements to do so.  Section 7 accomplishes
    the latter by providing for a mandatory stay of court proceedings unless one of
    the enumerated exceptions applies (which is not the case here) and, having
    regard to its overall wording, appears to address circumstances relating to a
    single arbitration agreement, and not the interconnection between a number of
    such agreements involving different parties.  This would work against the
    approach taken in <em>Griffin</em>, but was not considered in that case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, and more generally, ought litigants be entitled to sidestep
    what would otherwise be substantive and statutory impediments to proceeding in
    court with an arbitral claim by the simple expedient of adding consumer claims
    (which cannot be stayed, by virtue of the <em>Consumer Protection Act</em><i>,
    2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 30) to non-consumer claims (which generally are subject
    to a mandatory stay) and wrapping all claims in the cloak of a class
    proceeding?  Put another way, may the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em>,
    S.O. 1992, c. 6 (a procedural rights statute) be used to override the provisions
    of the <em>Arbitration Act 1991</em> affording contractual parties the right to
    agree to binding arbitration (a substantive right)?  As my colleague notes,
    courts have repeatedly said class action proceedings do not alter the
    jurisdiction of courts or tribunals or create new substantive rights: see <em>Bisaillon
    v. Concordia University</em>, 2006 SCC 19, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 666, at para. 22; <em>Dell
    Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs</em>, 2007 SCC 34, 284 D.L.R. (4th)
    577, at paras. 105-108; <em>Rogers Wireless Inc. v. Muroff</em>, 2007 SCC 35, 284
    D.L.R. (4th) 675, at paras. 1, 11-13, and 20; <i>Seidel</i>, at paras. 65-69,
    89, 96-119 and 135-138, per LeBel and Deschamps JJ. in dissent.  They have not
    said this principle may be overridden by resort to the preferable proceedings
    provisions under the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I flag these questions only to explain in a general way why I have
    reservations about the correctness of this Court’s decision in <em>Griffin</em><i>.</i> 
    Whatever the answers to them may be, they were not addressed by the <em>Griffin</em> court, which appears to have approached the problem more from the perspective
    of whether the class action was a preferable approach in order to avoid a
    multiplicity of proceedings or, in some cases, to avoid the impracticality of
    no proceedings at all.  While those are very legitimate concerns, it may be
    that a response to the foregoing questions is necessary before the court can
    reach the stage where class proceeding principles come into play.</p>
  <h5>Resolution</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Griffin</em><i> </i>decision is binding, however, and has not been
    affected in terms of that binding effect by <em>Seidel</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree, therefore, that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
