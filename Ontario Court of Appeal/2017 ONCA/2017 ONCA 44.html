  <p class=Heard>Heard: November 7, 2016</p>
  <p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Thomas J. Carey of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 5, 2016.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Strathy C.J.O.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises two questions:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> What limitation period applies to a proceeding on a foreign judgment in
    Ontario? and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When does that limitation period begin to run? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that the limitation period was the two-year “basic
    limitation period” specified in s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>,
    S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B. It began to run when the appeal of the foreign
    judgment was dismissed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal and answer the questions it
    raises as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A two-year limitation
    period applies to a proceeding on a foreign judgment; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The limitation period begins to run, at the earliest, when the time to
    appeal the foreign judgment has expired or, if an appeal is taken, the date of
    the appeal decision. The time may be longer if the claim was not “discovered”
    within the meaning of s. 5 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, until a date
    later than the appeal decision.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 24, 2013, the respondent obtained a judgment against the appellant in the
    New Jersey Superior Court for the payment of US$115,248. An appeal to the
    Appellate Division was dismissed on July 17, 2014. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 1, 2015, the respondent brought an application in the Ontario Superior
    Court of Justice to recover damages based on the New Jersey judgment, in an
    equivalent amount expressed in Canadian dollars. The application was commenced more
    than two years after the New Jersey judgment was rendered, but less than two
    years after the dismissal of the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant pleaded that the proceeding was time-barred. He argued that the
    limitation period was two years under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002 </em>and
    that time ran from the date of the first-instance New Jersey judgment. The
    result, he said, was that the limitation period expired before the application was
    commenced in Ontario. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge rejected this defence and granted judgment in favour of the
    respondent. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the application judge’s reasons</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that the proceeding on the New Jersey judgment was in
    time because it was commenced within two years of the dismissal of the New
    Jersey appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    found support for his decision that time ran from the date of the New Jersey
    appeal in Part III, Art. III, s. 1 of the <em>Reciprocal Enforcement of
    Judgments (U.K.) Act</em>, R.S.O. c. R.6 (“REJUKA”), which provides that a
    judgment of a United Kingdom court may be enforced in Ontario within six years
    after the date of judgment “or, where there have been proceedings by way of
    appeal against the judgment, <span class=Underline>after the date of the last
    judgment given in those proceedings</span>” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also found support
    in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em>Yugraneft Corp. v. Rexx
    Management Corp</em>., 2010 SCC 19, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 649. Rothstein J. held at
    para. 57 that a judgment debtor’s non-performance of the obligation created by a
    foreign arbitration judgment is only discoverable under the Alberta <em>Limitations
    Act</em>, R.S.A. 2000, c. L-12, “<span class=Underline>on the date the appeal
    period expires or, if an appeal is taken, the date of the appeal decision</span>”
    (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the application
    judge’s view, it would be inefficient and promote a multiplicity of proceedings
    to require a foreign judgment creditor to commence an Ontario proceeding
    pending an appeal of the underlying judgment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The application judge
    found it unnecessary to consider the respondent’s alternative argument that its
    proceeding on the New Jersey judgment fell under s. 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>,<em> 2002</em>, which states that there is no limitation period in
    respect of “a proceeding to enforce an order of a court, or any other order
    that may be enforced in the same way as an order of a court.” He suggested,
    however, that this court might wish to reconsider its decision in <em>Lax v.
    Lax</em> (2004), 70 O.R. (3d) 520 (C.A.), which dealt with the limitation
    period for a proceeding on a foreign judgment under the predecessor to the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002</em>.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the submissions of the parties</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The Appellant </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits
    that the application judge erred in holding that the limitation period began to
    run from the disposition of the New Jersey appeal. He submits it ran from the
    date of the first-instance judgment in New Jersey.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He relies on this
    court’s decision in <em>Lax</em>, holding that a foreign judgment is
    characterized as a simple contract debt, and argues that the basic two-year
    limitation period in s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> applies. He also
    relies on a line of Ontario jurisprudence establishing that a foreign judgment
    is final for the purpose of suing on it in Ontario even if the time for appeal
    has not expired or an appeal is pending: see <em>Four Embarcadero Center
    Venture v. Mr. Greenjeans Corp</em>. (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 736 (H.C.); and <em>Continental
    Casualty Company Co. v. Symons Estate</em>, 2015 ONSC 6394, 127 O.R. (3d) 758. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The Respondent</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent maintains
    that no limitation period applies to a proceeding on a foreign judgment because
    it falls under s. 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively, it says
    that if there is a two-year limitation period, the case law concerning when a foreign
    judgment becomes final has no application under the <em>Limitations Act</em>, <em>2002</em> and that time does not begin to run until appeal rights in the foreign
    jurisdiction have been exhausted.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The correct approach
    to resolving the two questions raised by this appeal begins and ends with the
    provisions of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, which is a comprehensive and
    exhaustive scheme for dealing with limitation periods: <em>Intact Insurance Co.
    of Canada v. Lombard General Insurance Co. of Canada</em>, 2015 ONCA 764, 128
    O.R. (3d) 658, at paras. 53-56, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2016]
    S.C.C.A. No. 10 and [2016] S.C.C.A. No. 11.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I will
    begin my analysis by explaining the purpose of statutes of limitation. I will
    then examine the relevant provisions of the former Ontario <em>Limitations Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, and their interpretation in the case law. Finally, I will
    discuss the legislative history of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002 </em>and the
    relevant provisions of the statute. Against this background, I will address the
    two questions raised by this appeal.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Discussion</h2>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span style='font-weight:normal'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The purposes of statutes of limitation</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Limitations statutes
    reflect public policy about efficiency and fairness in the justice system.
    There are three broad policy justifications for limitation statutes: <em>Manitoba
    Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1
    S.C.R. 623, at paras. 231-234.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, they promote
    finality and certainty in legal affairs by ensuring that potential defendants
    are not exposed to indefinite liability for past acts: <em>Hare v. Hare</em> (2006),
    83 O.R. (3d) 766 (C.A.), at para. 41. They reflect a policy that, after a
    reasonable time, people should be entitled to put their business and personal pasts
    behind them and should not be troubled by the possibility of “stale” claims
    emerging from the woodwork.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, they ensure
    the reliability of evidence. It is inefficient and unfair to try old claims
    because evidence becomes unreliable with the passage of time. Memories fade,
    witnesses die and evidence gets lost. After a reasonable time, people should
    not have to worry about the preservation of evidence: <em>K.M. v. H.M.</em>,
    [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6, at p. 30. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, and related to
    this, limitation periods promote diligence because they encourage litigants to
    pursue claims with reasonable dispatch.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other justifications
    have been given, including the interest in the efficient use of public
    resources through the expeditious resolution of disputes and the desirability
    of adjudicating disputes on the basis of contemporary values and standards: see
    Graeme Mew, <em>The Law of Limitations</em>, 3d ed. (Toronto, LexisNexis,
    2016), at pp. 16-18. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The former <em>Limitations Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Section 45(1)(g) of the former <em>Limitations Act </em>contained
    a six-year limitation period for an action on a simple contract or debt. A long
    line of cases held that an action on a foreign judgment was an action on a
    simple contract debt for limitations purposes and therefore subject to that
    six-year limitation period: see <em>Lax</em>, at para. 11; <em>Rutledge v.
    United States Saving &amp; Loan Co.</em> (1906), 37 S.C.R. 546, at p. 547; and <em>Bedell
    v. Gefaell (No. 1)</em>, [1938] O.R. 718 (C.A.), at p. 720. This view was based
    on the fiction of an implied promise by the foreign judgment debtor to pay the
    amount of the judgment. As Feldman J.A. noted, at para. 13 of <em>Lax</em>,
    this fiction was necessary because, “unlike a domestic judgment, a foreign
    judgment cannot be directly enforced [in Ontario] by execution. Rather, an
    action must be brought to enforce the debt it creates.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Section 45(1)(c) of the former <em>Limitations Act </em>also
    contained a twenty-year limitation period on an “action upon a judgment or
    recognizance.” In <em>Lax</em>, at paras. 20-25, Feldman J.A. confirmed that
    this provision did not apply to an action on a foreign judgment. It applied to
    an action brought in order to toll the limitation period to enforce a domestic
    judgment using the execution procedures set out in r. 60 of the <em>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The practice of bringing an action on a domestic judgment to
    toll the limitation period for its enforcement within the province was
    discussed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <em>Young v. Verigin</em>,
    2007 BCCA 551, 72 B.C.L.R. (4th) 332, at paras. 4-8. Newbury J.A. observed that
    in British Columbia, the limitation period for an action on a domestic judgment
    for the payment of money was reduced from twenty to ten years by the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>, S.B.C. 1975, c. 37, s. 3(2)(f). That provision was then amended by
    the <em>Enforcement of Canadian Judgments and Decrees Act</em>, S.B.C. 2005, c.
    29, by inserting the word “local” before the word “judgment,” presumably to
    clarify that the provision did not apply to foreign judgments: see <em>Limitation
    Act</em>, S.B.C. 2012, c. 13, s. 7(a).</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002 </em>was the culmination of several attempts, beginning in the late
    1960s, to reform, consolidate and simplify the law of limitations in Ontario.
    The history of those attempts was set out by Weiler J.A. in <em>York
    Condominium Corp. No. 382 v. Jay-M Holdings Ltd.</em>, 2007 ONCA 49, 84 O.R.
    (3d) 414, at paras. 27-30. See also <em>McConnell v. Huxtable</em>, 2013 ONSC

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the new
    statute was to replace a complex, obscure and confusing regime of multiple
    limitation periods with a simple and comprehensive scheme. The new scheme consists
    of a basic two-year limitation period applicable to most claims, an “ultimate
    limitation period” of fifteen years and a statutorily-enshrined discoverability
    principle. It was intended to promote certainty and clarity in the law of
    limitation periods: see <em>Dilollo Estate (Trustee of) v. I.F. Propco Holdings
    (Ontario) 36 Ltd.</em>, 2013 ONCA 81, 117 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 61.</p>

    Act, 2002</em> eliminated its predecessor’s twenty-year limitation period for
    an action “upon a judgment or recognizance.” However, it included a “proceeding

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the
    first question raised in this appeal – whether there is <span class=Underline>any</span> limitation period applicable to a proceeding on a foreign judgment. Section
    16(1) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, which had no counterpart in the
    former statute, created a class of claims that are subject to no limitation
    period, rather than the “basic” two-year limitation period or the “ultimate” fifteen-year
    limitation period.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The interpretation of
    s. 16(1)(b) has been the subject of conflicting decisions of the Ontario Superior
    Court of Justice. In <em>Commission de la Construction du Quebec v. Access
    Rigging Services Inc.</em>, 2010 ONSC 5897, 104 O.R. (3d) 313, McLean J. dealt
    with an application to enforce a 2005 Quebec judgment in Ontario. The
    application was brought in 2010. Quebec is not a reciprocating party to the <em>Reciprocal
    Enforcement of Judgments Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.5 (“REJA”). Hence, the
    basic two-year limitation period applied unless the claim fell within s.
    16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. The judgment debtor sought to
    dismiss the application as time-barred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judgment creditor,
    relying on <em>Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye</em>, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
    1077, and <em>Girsberger </em>argued that comity supported a liberal interpretation
    of s. 16(1)(b) as being applicable to foreign judgments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLean J. rejected
    this argument, finding that the two-year limitation period applied. Relying on <em>Lax</em>,
    he held that nothing in the wording of “order of a court” in s. 16(1)(b) shows
    an intention to change the common law position that a foreign judgment cannot
    be directly enforced in Ontario and that it must be converted into a domestic
    judgment that is enforceable in Ontario. In previous iterations of the act, the
    analogous term “judgment” referred to domestic judgments that could be enforced
    in Ontario without bringing a proceeding on the judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, McLean J.
    held that to interpret s. 16(1)(b) as applicable to proceedings on foreign
    judgments would be inconsistent with REJA, which contains a six-year limitation
    period for the registration of judgments of the courts of other provinces and
    territories, except Quebec.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> He found that the judgment creditor’s argument would lead to the incongruous
    result that there was no limitation period applicable to proceedings on Quebec
    judgments in Ontario, but proceedings on the judgments of other provinces would
    have a six-year limitation period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLean J. observed
    that the purpose of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> was to simplify the
    previously complex scheme of limitations and said it would have been simple
    enough to include foreign judgments in s. 16(1)(b), had that been the
    legislature’s intention. It was not the court’s responsibility to make a change
    that the legislature had not.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>PT ATPK
    Resources TBK (Indonesia) v. Diversified Energy and Resources Corp.</em>,<em> </em>2013
    ONSC 5913, Newbould J. questioned the reasoning in <em>Access Rigging.</em> He
    suggested that knowledge of a foreign judgment did not fit well with the language
    of knowledge of “injury loss or damage” in the discoverability provision in s.
    5 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. In his view, it made more sense to
    treat a claim for the enforcement of a foreign judgment as having no limitation
    period under s. 16(1)(b), to which the discoverability provision does not apply.
    This, he said, would also be more consistent with the principles of comity
    expressed by the<em> </em>Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Beals v. Saldhana</em>,
    2003 SCC 72, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 416,<em> </em>and <em>Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf
    Inc</em>., 2006 SCC 52, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 612.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>S.A. Horeca
    Financial Services v. Light</em>, 2014 ONSC 4551,<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Murray J. disagreed with<em> Access Rigging </em>and preferred the reasoning in <em>PT ATPK. </em>He also referred to <em>Beals</em>, noting the importance of
    comity. In contrast to the view taken in <em>Access Rigging</em>, he suggested
    that the legislature’s failure to <span class=Underline>exclude</span> foreign
    judgments from s. 16(1)(b) was significant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It falls to this court,
    as a matter of first impression, to interpret whether s. 16(1)(b) applies to a
    proceeding on a foreign judgment. The words of s. 16(1)(b) are to be read in
    light of the language of the provision as a whole, their context within the
    statutory scheme, and the purposes of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002:</em> see <em>R.
    v. Hajivasilis</em>, 2013 ONCA 27, 114 O.R. (3d) 337, at para. 23; and<em> Ayr
    Farmers Mutual Insurance Co. v. Wright</em>, 2016 ONCA 789, at paras. 26,
    28-29, 31-32.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>First</span>, therefore, I consider the language of
    s. 16(1)(b) as a whole. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Phrases serving
    parallel functions and associated by the disjunction “or” in a statutory
    provision influence each other’s meaning. The parallelism “invites the reader
    to look for a common feature among the terms” to resolve any ambiguities: Ruth
    Sullivan, <em>The Construction of Statutes</em>, 6th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis,
    2014), at p. 230. The Supreme Court has stated that “a term or an expression
    should not be interpreted without taking the surrounding terms into account” in
    order to identify a “common thread”: <em>Opitz v. Wrzesnewskyj</em>, 2012 SCC
    55, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 76, at paras. 40, 43.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the term
    “order of a court” in s. 16(1)(b) takes its meaning, in part, from the parallel
    phrase immediately associated with it – namely, “any other order that may be <span
class=Underline>enforced</span> in the same way as an order of a court”
    (emphasis added). I observe that a similar parallel phrase is found in s. 19(1)
    of the <em>Statutory Powers Procedure Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.22, which
    provides that “[a] certified copy of a tribunal’s decision or order in a
    proceeding may be filed in the Superior Court of Justice by the tribunal or by
    a party and on filing shall be deemed to be an order of that court and is <span
class=Underline>enforceable</span> as such” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “common feature”
    or “common thread” linking these parallelisms is the concept of enforceability.
    Section 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> applies to court orders
    and to other orders, such as those of persons exercising a statutory power of
    decision, that are enforceable in the same way as a court order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This common thread within
    s. 16(1)(b) does not extend to foreign judgments. The domestic judgments contemplated
    by the provision are directly enforceable in Ontario by means of the execution procedures
    in r. 60 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, including writs of seizure
    and sale, garnishment, or the appointment of a receiver: <em>Lax</em>, at para.
    21. By contrast, like an order of a foreign arbitral tribunal, the debt
    obligation created by a foreign judgment cannot be directly enforced in Ontario
    in the absence of reciprocal enforcement legislation such as REJA or REJUKA. A
    proceeding in Ontario must be brought first: see <em>Lax </em>at paras. 11-13; <em>Yugraneft </em>at para. 45; <em>Chevron Corp. v. Yaiguaje</em>, 2015 SCC 42, [2015] 3
    S.C.R. 69, at para. 43. That proceeding may result in a judgment or order of
    the Ontario court. The resulting order may be enforced as an order of the court,
    with no applicable limitation period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the judgment of
    a foreign court is one step removed from being an order of a court for the
    purpose of s. 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. It is not on the
    same level as an order of an Ontario court or any other order, such as an order
    of an Ontario statutory decision maker, which may be enforced as an order of a
    domestic court. This was adverted to by Feldman J.A. in <em>Lax</em>, at para.
    31, in explaining why she did not agree with the approach taken by Cumming J.
    in <em>Girsberger</em>: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A]s long as only domestic judgments can be enforced by
    execution and the other methods discussed above, and therefore foreign
    judgments must be transformed into domestic judgments or registered before they
    are enforceable as domestic judgments, there is not parity of treatment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are good reasons
    for giving different treatment for limitations purposes to the enforcement in
    Ontario of a judgment of an Ontario court, on the one hand, and a judgment of a
    foreign court, on the other hand. The principle of territorial sovereignty means
    that the judgment of a court has effect only inside the territory in which the
    court is located and cannot be enforced outside its borders: Stephen G.A. Pitel
    &amp; Nicholas S. Rafferty, <em>Conflict of Laws</em>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Irwin
    Law, 2016), at p. 162. The extraterritorial enforcement of a court’s order is not
    a legitimate exercise of state power: see <em>Tolofson v. Jensen</em>, [1994] 3
    S.C.R. 1022, at p. 1052;<em> Club Resorts Ltd. v. Van Breda</em>, 2012 SCC 17,
    [2012] 1 S.C.R. 572, at para. 31; <em>Chevron</em>, at paras. 47-48; and <em>Endean
    v. British Columbia</em>, 2016 SCC 42, 401 D.L.R. (4th) 577, at para. 45.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, while a domestic
    judgment can be enforced as of right in Ontario, it is necessary to bring a
    proceeding on a foreign judgment. If that proceeding is successful, it will
    give rise to an Ontario judgment which can be directly enforced in the province.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Furthermore, a
    judgment creditor who brings an Ontario proceeding on a foreign judgment must show
    that the foreign court had jurisdiction and that the judgment is final and for
    the payment of money (or that it would be appropriate for the Ontario court to
    recognize it as enforceable within the province even if it is interlocutory or
    non-monetary): see <em>Pro Swing</em>; <em>Chevron</em>; and <em>Cavell
    Insurance Co. (Re)</em> (2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 500 (C.A.), at para. 41. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foreign judgment
    debtor is entitled to raise defences to the proceeding, such as fraud, denial
    of natural justice and public policy: see <em>Beals</em>. These defences
    “distinguish foreign judgments from local judgments, against which the sole
    recourse is an appeal”: Janet Walker &amp; Jean-Gabriel Castel, <em>Canadian
    Conflict of Laws</em>, loose-leaf (Rel. 54-3/2016 Pub.5911), 6th ed. (Toronto:
    LexisNexis, 2005), at para. 14.3.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the
    language of s. 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> suggests that the
    term “order of a court” refers to an order of a domestic court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>Second</span>, I consider the statutory context of
    s. 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 16(1)(b) also
    takes its meaning from the surrounding provisions of s. 16. When statutory
    provisions are grouped together, the legislature is presumed to have drafted
    each with the others in mind: <em>Inland Revenue Commissioners v.&nbsp;Hinchy</em>,
    [1960] A.C. 748 (H.L.), at p. 766. They tend to illuminate each other’s meaning
    because they “share a single idea”: Ruth Sullivan, <em>Statutory Interpretation</em>,
    3d ed. (Toronto, Irwin Law, 2016), at p. 175. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other provisions
    grouped together in s. 16 pertain to claims such as family law support awards,
    sexual assault claims and government claims that are considered so important
    that, for one policy reason or another, they should have no limitation period
    at all. For example, the policy reason underlying the exemption for sexual
    assault claims “is grounded in the likelihood that the dynamic of the
    relationship will impede the autonomy of the victim”: <em>Boyce v. Toronto
    (City) Police Services Board</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2011 ONSC 53, at para. 40,
    aff’d, 2012 ONCA 230.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span

    this context, it is important to identify the policy reason for including claims
    “to enforce an order of a court” in the subset of claims that have no
    limitation period under s. 16. In my view, the reason is that such claims have
    already passed a limitations hurdle under Ontario law – a court order can only
    be obtained if the underlying cause of action giving rise to it was not
    time-barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>This
    was the policy reason suggested by the British Columbia Law Reform Commission,
    in its 1974 </span><em>Report on Limitations</em><span lang=EN-US>, for the
    argument that no limitation period should apply to claims to enforce domestic court
    orders. As quoted by Newbury J.A. in </span><em>Young v. Verigin</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 7, the commission wrote: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Furthermore, the successful plaintiff cannot
    be said to have slept on his rights. He has taken action, and as a consequence
    recovered judgment. It might be argued, with considerable justification, that
    no limitation period whatsoever should exist with respect to the enforcement of
    judgments. It may seem unfair that the plaintiff who has been put to the
    trouble and expense of obtaining a judgment to enforce a right or obligation
    should face a further limitation period with respect to the exercise of his
    rights under the judgment. Why should he not be free to pursue his rights under
    the judgment at his leisure if he so chooses?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>It
    follows that the term “order of a court” in s. 16(1)(b) should be interpreted
    as referring to an order of a domestic court only. A proceeding on a foreign
    judgment has not passed any Ontario limitations hurdle. If the action on the foreign
    judgment is successful, it results in an Ontario judgment, which is subject to
    no limitation period. But that can only be justified if the underlying cause of
    action based on the foreign judgment has already passed a limitations hurdle in
    Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  I find support for
    this conclusion in the <em>Report of the</em> <em>Ontario Law Reform Commission
    on the Limitation of Actions</em> (Toronto: Department of the Attorney General,
    1969), at pp.50-51. The report stated, at p. 49, that there was good reason to
    apply the longer twenty-year limitation period in the former <em>Limitations
    Act</em> to actions on domestic judgments because, in terms later adopted by
    the British Columbia report, “the successful plaintiff cannot be said to have
    slept on his rights. He has taken action and, as a consequence, recovered
    judgment.” However, the report nevertheless recommended that foreign judgments
    should remain subject to the six-year limitation period governing debts in the
    former <em>Limitations Act</em>, notwithstanding the artificiality of treating
    them as simple contract debts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also noteworthy
    that several provinces have subjected foreign judgment proceedings to a special
    limitation period that is distinct from the one that applies to proceedings on
    domestic judgments. British Columbia’s <em>Limitation Act</em> subjects “local”
    judgment proceedings to a ten year limitation period in s. 7, but it deals with
    “extraprovincial judgments” separately. Section 2(1)(l) of Manitoba’s <em>The
    Limitation of Actions Act</em>, C.C.S.M., c L150, treats “Canadian judgments”
    differently from other judgments. Newfoundland sets a six-year limitation
    period on an action “to enforce a foreign judgment” and a ten-year period on
    actions to enforce a judgment of a court in the province: see <em>Limitations
    Act</em>, S.N.L. 1995, c. L-16.1, s. 6(1)(g). And Prince Edward Island’s <em>Statute
    of Limitations</em>, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. S-7, s. 2(1)(f) distinguishes between
    “extraprovincial judgments” and other judgments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statutory context
    therefore suggests that the language of s. 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act,
    2002</em> is confined to orders of domestic courts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>Third</span>, and finally, I consider s. 16(1)(b)
    in light of the purposes of limitations statutes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would be contrary
    to the purposes of limitations statutes to interpret s. 16(1)(b) as exempting
    foreign judgments from any limitation period. If it were always possible to
    bring a proceeding on a foreign judgment in Ontario without time limitation, no
    matter when and where it was obtained, the debtor would be indefinitely exposed
    to the prospect of defending such proceedings in Ontario. As was pointed out in
    the Ontario Law Reform Commission’s report at p. 50, problems associated with
    the preservation and reliability of evidence are especially pronounced for
    foreign judgment debtors. This militates in favour of having some limitation
    period apply to proceedings on foreign judgments. As well, exempting such
    proceedings from a limitation period would not encourage diligence or
    reasonable dispatch on the part of the foreign judgment creditor, who, unlike
    domestic judgment creditors, has not already surmounted an Ontario limitations
    hurdle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before concluding, I would
    remark that, despite their undoubted importance, the principles of comity
    expressed in <em>Morguard</em>, <em>Beals</em>, <em>Chevron</em> and <em>Cavell</em> do not require the absence of <span class=Underline>any</span> limitation
    period for a proceeding on a foreign judgment. Nor do they supersede the
    equally important policy rationales for limitations statutes. It is one thing
    to remove barriers to the extraterritorial recognition of foreign judgments.
    But it is quite another to grant them more generous status than any other debt
    obligation or to give them the same status as a domestic judgment for
    limitations purposes, thereby circumventing the very reasons for limitation
    periods.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude, therefore,
    that s. 16(1)(b) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> does not apply to
    proceedings on foreign judgments, and the applicable limitation period for the
    respondent’s proceeding on the New Jersey judgment at issue in this appeal is
    the basic two-year period in s. 4. The result is that time begins to run when
    the claim is “discovered” within the meaning of s. 5. I turn to that question
    next. </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>When does time begin
    to run on a proceeding on a foreign judgment in Ontario?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found
    that the limitation period for the respondent to commence his proceeding on the
    New Jersey judgment ran from the date the New Jersey appeal was dismissed. As I
    have noted, he found that this was consistent with REJUKA and with the Supreme
    Court’s approach to the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in <em>Yugraneft.</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits
    that this is inconsistent with previous authorities, including the decision of
    Henry J. in <em>Four Embarcadero </em>and, more recently, the decision of Glustein
    J. in <em>Continental Casualty</em>. Those cases stand for the proposition that
    a proceeding on a foreign judgment may be commenced in Ontario even if the judgment
    is not final, in the sense that the time to appeal it in the foreign
    jurisdiction has not expired or it is actually under appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, those
    cases are of no assistance in resolving the issue of when time begins to run in
    a proceeding on a foreign judgment. The question of a judgment’s finality is
    relevant not to statutory limitation periods to commence a proceeding on a
    foreign judgment, but to the conditions that a foreign judgment creditor must
    satisfy to succeed on the proceeding: see <em>Cavell</em>, at paras. 41-43. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test under the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002</em> is not whether the judgment is “final”; it is when the claim is <span
class=Underline>discovered</span>, a fact that is ascertained through the
    application of s. 5(1), aided by the presumption in s. 5(2).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I acknowledge the
    point made by Newbould J. in <em>PT ATPK </em>that, in the context of s. 5(1)
    of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, a proceeding on a foreign judgment does
    not fall particularly neatly into the definition of “claim” as “a claim to
    remedy an injury, loss or damage that occurred as a result of an act or
    omission.” However, the statute was meant to be comprehensive and exhaustive.
    Section 2(1) provides that it applies to “claims pursued in court proceedings,”
    and s. 4 provides that the basic two-year limitation period applies “unless
    this Act provides otherwise.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The words “injury, loss
    or damage” in s. 5(1) can reasonably refer to the debt obligation created by a
    foreign judgment and owed by the foreign judgment debtor to the creditor. The
    “act or omission” can reasonably refer to the debtor’s failure to discharge the
    obligation once it became final<em>.</em> Viewed in this light, s. 5(1) can
    reasonably be viewed as applying to a proceeding on a foreign judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note, in this
    regard, that the discoverability provision in Alberta’s <em>Limitations Act</em> differs from the Ontario provision in that it contains a definition of “injury”
    that includes the non-performance of an obligation. Rothstein J. adverted to this
    definition in <em>Yugraneft</em>, at para. 50. Although Newbould J.’s comment in <em>PT ATPK</em> is a fair one, Justice Rothstein’s reference lends weight to
    the observation that fitting a foreign judgment within the definition of
    “injury” in s. 5(1) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> is not as strained as
    it might seem.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 5(1) provides
    that a claim is discovered on the earlier of: (a) the day on which the claimant
    first knew, among other things, “that having regard to the nature of the
    injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to
    remedy it”; and (b) the day on which “a reasonable person with the abilities
    and in the circumstances of the person with the claim first ought to have known
    of the matters referred to in clause (a)”. The test in s. 5(1)(a) has been
    referred to as a “subjective test” because it looks to the claimant’s actual
    knowledge, and the test in s.5(1)(b) as a “modified objective” test because it
    looks to what a reasonable person with the abilities and in the circumstances
    of the claimant ought to have known: see <em>Ferrera v. Lorenzetti Wolfe
    Barristers and Solicitors</em>, 2012 ONCA 851, 113 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 70;
    and <em>Crombie Property Holdings Limited v. McColl-Frontenac Inc. (Texaco
    Canada Limited)</em>, 2017 ONCA 16, at para. 35.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>407 ETR
    Concession Co. v. Day</em>, 2016 ONCA 709, at para. 48, Laskin J.A. explained
    that “one reason why the legislature added ‘appropriate means’ [in s. 5(1)(a)] as
    an element of discoverability was to enable courts to function more efficiently
    by deterring needless litigation.” “Appropriate” means “legally appropriate.”
    For example, a tactical choice to delay commencement of a proceeding to engage
    in settlement discussions after a loss, injury or damage is known does not make
    the proceeding inappropriate: <em>Markel Insurance Co. of Canada v. ING
    Insurance Co. of Canada</em>, 2012 ONCA 218, 109 O.R. (3d) 652, at para. 24. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appropriateness must
    be assessed on the facts of each case, and case law applying s. 5(1)(a)(iv) is
    of limited assistance: <em>Brown v. Baum</em>, 2016 ONCA 325, 348 O.A.C. 251,
    at para. 41. However, it is noteworthy that courts have held that a proceeding
    is not legally appropriate until other mechanisms for resolving a dispute, such
    as a statutory remedial process, have been exhausted: see <em>407 ETR</em>, at
    para. 40; <em>U-Pak Disposals (1989) Ltd. v. Durham (Regional Municipality)</em>,
    2014 ONSC 1103, at paras. 22-25; <em>Kadiri v. Southlake Regional Health Centre</em>,
    2015 ONSC 621, at paras. 52-57, aff’d, 2015 ONCA 847; and Mew, at pp. 95-96.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the usual case, it
    will not be legally appropriate to commence a legal proceeding on a foreign
    judgment in Ontario until the time to appeal the judgment in the foreign jurisdiction
    has expired or all appeal remedies have been exhausted. The foreign appeal
    process has the potential to resolve the dispute between the parties. If the
    judgment is overturned, the debt obligation underlying the judgment creditor’s
    proceeding on the foreign judgment disappears. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach is
    consistent with the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in <em>Laasch v. Turenne</em>,
    2012 ABCA 32, 522 A.R. 168. In that case, the court determined that the
    statutory limitation period to commence a proceeding on a Montana judgment
    began to run even while the creditor sought to register the judgment under
    Alberta’s reciprocal enforcement legislation. The existence of the reciprocal
    enforcement statute <span class=Underline>did not</span> displace the common
    law process for a proceeding on a foreign judgment. Therefore, the proceeding
    was “warranted” within the meaning of the discoverability provision of
    Alberta’s <em>Limitations Act</em> even while the creditor sought registration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To regard a claim
    based on the foreign judgment as discoverable and appropriate only when all
    appeals have been exhausted is also consistent with the observations of
    Rothstein J. in <em>Yugraneft</em>. He stated, at para. 57, that the limitation
    period to enforce a foreign arbitral judgment under Alberta’s <em>Limitations
    Act</em> starts to run when the time to appeal the judgment has expired or,
    where an appeal is taken, the date of the appeal decision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, as the
    application judge noted, this approach avoids the risk of multiplicity of
    proceedings by not requiring the judgment creditor to commence a proceeding on
    a foreign judgment in Ontario before all proceedings in the foreign
    jurisdiction have run their course. It furthers the purpose of s. 5(1)(a)(iv)
    of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> by deterring the unnecessary litigation
    that may result from commencing an Ontario proceeding on a foreign judgment
    that is subsequently overturned.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foregoing approach
    to the discoverability of a foreign judgment does not preclude a foreign
    judgment creditor seeking an interim <em>Mareva</em> injunction to freeze
    exigible assets of the judgment debtor in Ontario before a proceeding on the
    foreign judgment is commenced in the province and the foreign appeal process is
    still running its course: see <em>Chitel v. Rothbart</em> (1983), 39 O.R. (2d)
    513 (C.A.); and <em>Aetna Financial Services v. Feigelman</em>, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
    2. Nor does the approach preclude a foreign judgment debtor obtaining a stay of
    execution of an Ontario judgment that the creditor obtained after successfully
    suing on a foreign judgment that is still under appeal: see <em>DSLangdale Two
    LCC v. Diasytek (Canada) Inc.</em>, [2004] O.T.C. 1133 (S.C.), at paras. 13-16.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a particular case, a
    claim based on a foreign judgment may not be discovered under s. 5 of the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002</em> until such time as the judgment creditor knew or ought to have
    known that the judgment debtor had exigible assets in Ontario and could be served
    with process: see <em>Yugraneft</em> at paras. 49. 58, 61. As s. 5(1)(b) makes
    clear, the discoverability assessment, including the appropriateness criterion,
    must take account of the factual context and the plaintiff’s actual
    circumstances, and I reiterate that each case must be decided on its own facts:
    see <em>407 ETR</em>, at paras. 34, 45-46. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, I
    conclude that the respondent’s claim based on the New Jersey judgment was
    discoverable on July 17, 2014, the date the appeal was dismissed in New Jersey.
    The respondent would not have reasonably known that a proceeding in Ontario
    would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy its loss until that date. Thus,
    the limitation period for the respondent to commence its proceeding on the New
    Jersey judgment began on that date. The respondent brought the proceeding on
    May 1, 2015, within the applicable two-year limitation period. Hence, the
    proceeding was not time-barred.</p>
  <h1>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>order</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I
    would dismiss the appeal, with costs to the respondent in the amount of
    $9,000.00, inclusive of interest and all applicable disbursements.</p>
