  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgments of Justice Grant R. Dow of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated January 12, 2016, with reasons reported at
    2016 ONSC 10.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Pepall J.A.:</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These appeals involve competing claims for relief relating to an easement.
    The easement is located on land situated north of railway tracks that currently
    service GO Trains and the newly-established Union Pearson Express. The
    contested easement leads to another, uncontested easement that runs along a
    rail corridor. Together, the easements provide access for maintenance of the
    railway tracks.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Metrolinx, sought a declaration that the contested
    easement was valid and an injunction requiring the respondent, Remicorp
    Industries Inc., to remove certain encroachments on it. Remicorp, who owns the
    lands on which the easement is situate, sought a declaration that the easement
    had been abandoned or extinguished or, in the alternative, that it be
    relocated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applications judge accepted Remicorp’s position. He dismissed
    Metrolinx’s application and found that the easement had been abandoned. Although
    Remicorp had sought relocation as alternative relief, the applications judge ordered
    that the easement be relocated. Metrolinx now appeals on the basis that the applications
    judge erred in concluding that the easement had been abandoned, and in ordering
    it to be relocated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow Metrolinx’s appeals.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>facts</h1>
  <h4>The Property</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Canadian National Railway Company (“CN”) owned the Mimico railway
    station in the west of Toronto. The station property consisted of a small
    building surrounded by a parking lot and vegetation (the “Property”). The
    Property lies west of Royal York Road and borders on Judson Street to the north
    with railway lands and tracks to the south. On a survey dated November 26,
    2002, the Property is divided into nine parts. The significant parts for the
    purposes of this appeal are Parts 1, 2, 3, and 5, highlighted below:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=center style='text-align:center'><span class="AParaNumbering" style="text-align:center"><img src="2017ONCA0443.jpg" alt="" width=721
height=497 id="Picture 1"></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The easement under dispute in these appeals is shown on Part 5. Part 5 is
    a curved, uphill, unpaved laneway running from Judson Street to the parking lot
    providing access to the station and to the uncontested easement. This laneway is
    described by the parties as the “Access Easement”. It is approximately 6.1 to
    11 metres wide and about 45 metres long. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The uncontested easement is shown on Parts 2 and 3, and is described as
    the “Maintenance Easement”. Part 3 is a strip of land, 3 metres wide and 70 metres
    long, running west to east immediately north of the rail corridor. At its
    eastern end, Part 3 is met by the Access Easement. At its western end, it meets
    Part 2, a small quartile of land that is met by Part 1 on the survey. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part 1 is on the western side of the Property. It is a strip of land,
    6.1 metres wide and 60 metres long, that runs from Judson Street in the north
    to Part 2 in the south. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Easements</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2002, CN sold its Property to Remicorp, a concrete manufacturing company.
    Remicorp intended to build a concrete factory on the Property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>CN <span lang=EN-US>conveyed the Property to Remicorp, reserving
    the Access and Maintenance Easements to itself. Remicorp also agreed to build a
    6-foot fence and gates acceptable to CN along the southern boundary of the
    Property that would abut the railway lands that CN continued to own. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the Access Easement and the Maintenance Easement reserved to CN, its successors
    and assigns “an exclusive, free, uninterrupted and unobstructed right and
    easement in the nature of a right-of-way” that extended to use by vehicles and
    equipment. The sale transaction closed and the deed was registered on December
    11, 2002. The deed included the Part 5 Access Easement and the Parts 2 and 3
    Maintenance Easement in favour of CN. The Access Easement was for the purpose
    of accessing CN’s adjacent and abutting lands and the lands on which the
    Maintenance Easement was situate. The Maintenance Easement was for the purpose
    of maintenance of CN’s railway tracks and other related railway operations.
    Both easements were for the benefit of CN and its successors and assigns. The relevant
    portion of the deed is attached as an appendix to these reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime
    in 2002 or 2003, Renato Silva, the owner of Remicorp, contacted Ernie Longo,
    CN’s Manager of Business Development and Real Estate, about relocating the Access
    Easement from the eastern side of the Property along Part 5 to the western side
    of the Property along Part 1. The possibility of moving the Access Easement had
    been discussed at the time of the sale of the Property but nothing had been
    documented. No direct evidence from Longo or evidence of his authority to bind
    Metrolinx was tendered, but Silva deposed that Longo liked the relocation
    because it was “in a straight line and fairly flat”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    June of 2003, Remicorp moved the Judson Street entrance to the Property from Part
    5 in the east, where the Access Easement is located, to Part 1 in the west.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 19, 2003, Remicorp and CN entered into an “Easement Agreement” in the
    nature of an option agreement in favour of CN. CN and Remicorp agreed that <span
class=Underline>upon the written request of CN</span>, Remicorp was to: (i) apply
    for and use its best efforts to obtain consent to the Part 1 easement from the
    City of Toronto Committee of Adjustment, (ii) grant the Part 1 easement to CN,
    and (iii) register the Part 1 easement on title. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties to the Easement Agreement expressly acknowledged the Access Easement on
    Part 5 and described it as the “Original Access Easement”. The Easement Agreement
    provided that on the registration of the Part 1 easement (described as the “Permanent
    Easement”) in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, on Remicorp’s written
    request, CN was to release the Original Access Easement. The Easement Agreement
    was registered on title on November 6, 2003. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CN
    never made any written request of Remicorp and hence never exercised its
    option; the Part 1 easement was never registered on title; and there is no
    evidence of the Committee of Adjustment’s consent or a release of the Access
    Easement from CN. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    Remicorp used Part 1 for ingress and egress to and from the Property. It also
    erected certain structures in the path of the Access Easement including a sheet
    metal wall, a garage/shed, and concrete troughs. In 2014, it erected a 6.5-metre
    high acoustical barrier that encroaches on the Maintenance Easement. Remicorp
    erected some of the structures without obtaining the necessary permits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    its part, after entering into the sale transaction in 2002, CN did not use either
    the Access Easement or the unrealized Part 1 easement.</p>
  <h4>Sale to Metrolinx</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In April 2010, CN transferred its interest in the rail corridor
    lands to Metrolinx,<span lang=EN-US> an agency of the Ontario Government. Metrolinx’s
    mission, among other things, is to develop and implement an integrated
    transportation system for the Greater Toronto Area. It operates the GO Train
    network that facilitates passenger movement by rail to and from the Greater
    Toronto Area and beyond. It is also responsible for the new Union Pearson
    Express. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    transfer from CN to Metrolinx included CN’s rights to the Access Easement and
    the Maintenance Easement. Despite its transfer to Metrolinx, CN retained
    responsibility for the planning, design, and installation of the signal system
    for the rail corridor. In 2012, it erected a signal bridge, part of which sits
    on the south side of the Maintenance Easement. Using the Maintenance Easement,
    Metrolinx is able to drive its usual maintenance vehicle past the signal bridge
    on the south with about 10 centimetres to spare on the north.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Metrolinx
    has never exercised any rights it may have to the Access Easement or the
    prospective easement on Part 1. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only repair and maintenance facility for the entire GO Train network,
    Willowbrook, sits to the southwest of the Property. The future needs of
    Metrolinx appear to be increasing. Over the years, Willowbrook has been
    expanded and two additional tracks have been installed on the northern edge of
    Metrolinx’s property. Metrolinx can gain access to Willowbrook using the
    Maintenance Easement and from the south and west of its railway lands.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2014, Remicorp obtained an Environmental Compliance Approval which permitted it
    to make intense use of Part 1 for ingress and egress to and from its Property. Remicorp
    is now allowed to operate 16 trucks per hour between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and
    7:00 p.m. using Part 1.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Remicorp and Metrolinx have had unsuccessful discussions about
    the sale of the Property to Metrolinx. The applications judge noted that the
    outcome of the parties’ court proceedings will likely have an impact on the
    value of the Property<span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>.</span></p>
  <h4>Court Proceedings</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>This brings me to the particulars of the court proceedings commenced
    by each of the </span>parties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remicorp
    sought a declaration that the Access Easement over Part 5 was abandoned,
    obsolete, redundant and/or extinguished, or, in the alternative, asked for an
    order that it be relocated to Part 1. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Metrolinx
    sought a declaration that the Part 5 Access Easement is valid, in force, and
    binding on Remicorp. It also sought injunctive relief requiring Remicorp to stop
    obstructing the Access Easement and to remove certain encroachments. Metrolinx argued
    that use of the area attendant to the rail corridor has intensified in recent
    years. Absent use of the Access Easement, track protection for the safety of
    trains and workers would result in tracks being taken out of service, delays,
    and additional costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other parties to the applications, and in particular, CN, have taken no
    position in either of the two proceedings.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Reasons of the
    Applications Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US> </span>The applications judge dismissed Metrolinx’s application and
    granted Remicorp’s.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applications judge focused on whether Metrolinx had abandoned the Access
    Easement. He explained that abandonment can occur through express release,
    implied release, or by operation of law: <em>Lywood v. Hunt</em><i> </i>(2009),
    97 O.R. (3d) 520 (S.C.), aff’d 2011 ONCA 229. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    5 Access Easement; (4) the drafting and registration on title of the September 2003
    Easement Agreement; (5) and a December 2014 Metrolinx photograph of 12 large
    concrete blocks that blocked the south end of Part 1. The applications judge

    Part 1. </p>

    “does not own the right of way but only enjoys the reasonable use of that
    property for its granted purpose”. In the applications judge’s view, “the
    purpose here was to pass over for access to the tracks when or if required, not
    to place or build anything permanent on that land”: at para. 21. Metrolinx was
    entitled to its Access Easement, but the facts and circumstances of the case
    required that it be moved to Part 1. </p>

    Titles Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5 [“LTA”] applies. I conclude the
    modification is beneficial to the parties interested and the existing easement

    failed to apply established case law on the need to demonstrate an intention to
    abandon in the face of an express grant of easement; and (iii) he improperly

    disputes these submissions and states that the applications judge considered
    the three registrations on title but found that they were outweighed by the
    factors that demonstrated an implied intention to abandon. Furthermore,
    Remicorp argues that although the applications judge did not make express reference
    to intention, his reasons clearly imply that he found an intention to abandon.
    In any event, argues Remicorp, the weighing of the factors in the applications judge’s
    analysis of abandonment is discretionary and his decision is entitled to
    deference. Lastly, he did not improperly consider any extraneous issues.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applications judge was dealing with an express grant of easement. CN asserted
    its rights to the Access Easement in the 2002 deed from CN to Remicorp, in the 2003
    Easement Agreement between CN and Remicorp, and in the 2010 deed from CN to
    Metrolinx. All were registered on title. </p>

    absent an exception, a conveyance includes all easements. Here, the Access
    Easement and the Maintenance Easement were expressly included, and not excepted,
    in both the conveyance from CN to Remicorp and the conveyance from CN to
    Metrolinx. Put differently, CN maintained its rights to use and transfer the
    easements. There is no question that paper title to the enjoyment of the Part 5
    Access Easement remained with CN and was then transferred to Metrolinx. </span></p>

    be express or implied. The onus of proof is on the party asserting a release: </span><em>Liscombe

    (London: Thomson Reuters (Professional) UK Limited, 2017), the authors warn, at
    para. 12-26: “Unless the easement is granted for a term of years, the rights
    conferred by an easement are perpetual and, accordingly, are actually or
    potentially valuable rights. Therefore it is not lightly to be inferred that
    the owner of such a right should give it up for no consideration.” </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An easement can be expressly released by the
    dominant owner, that is, the party who has received the grant of easement – in
    this case CN and then Metrolinx. As noted by the applications judge, there was
    no express release. This was undisputed. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An easement can also be released impliedly. Non-use

style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em><span lang=EN-US>at p. 335, non-use may
    arise because an owner of an easement had for the time no occasion to use it as
    another more convenient means of employing the land was available. However,
    this lack of use did not prove that the owner of the easement intended to
    abandon it. See also </span><em>Ward v. Ward</em><em><span style='font-style:

  <p class=MsoHeading7>Application to
    this Case </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the applications judge erred in
    finding an implied release. There are several reasons why.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, in considering whether the applications judge’s
    conclusion that the Access Easement had been impliedly released may be
    sustained, three registrations on title are relevant. The Access Easement and
    the Maintenance Easement were in the 2002 grant from CN to Remicorp. The Access
    Easement was then expressly addressed in considerable detail in the Easement Agreement
    of September 2003 between CN and Remicorp. Lastly, both easements were included
    in CN’s transfer to Metrolinx in 2010. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While the applications judge was aware of these
    three documents in that he states that the legal documents do not support the
    position of Remicorp, I agree with Metrolinx that he failed to consider that
    the registrations on title represented evidence of the absence of an intention
    to abandon the Part 5 Access Easement by CN. In fact, the evidence to the
    contrary was both strong and unequivocal. The parties deliberately turned their
    minds to the treatment of the easement rights held by CN. The Easement
    Agreement contemplated an option by CN that was never exercised. CN’s
    subsequent transfer of its easement rights to Metrolinx is consistent with the
    absence of any such exercise. There is no evidence that any of the steps
    contemplated by the Easement Agreement to effect a release of the Part 5 Access
    Easement ever took place. For instance, there is no evidence of CN making a written
    request, no evidence of Remicorp having applied for or using its best efforts
    to get the Committee of Adjustment to consent to the Part 1 easement, and no
    evidence that the Part 1 easement was ever registered on title as an easement. Had
    the applications judge considered this evidence, he would not have concluded
    that the requisite elements in support of an implied release were present.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Secondly, as mentioned, easement rights may have
    value. There was no evidence as to why CN, or indeed Metrolinx, would have
    intended to abandon such rights and there was no evidence of any consideration
    that flowed from Remicorp to CN in exchange for any release. The applications judge
    failed to consider this as a factor that supported the absence of any such
    intention. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thirdly, the Access Easement was an express
    grant that was registered on title. As Aitken J. stated in <em>2108133 Ontario
    Inc. v. Kabcan Foods Ltd.</em> (2009), 80 R.P.R. (4th) 194 (Ont. S.C.), at
    para. 8, the intent to abandon means that the person entitled to the easement
    has knowingly, and with full appreciation of his rights, determined to abandon
    it. The applications judge made no finding in this regard. Indeed, although the
    onus of proof was on Remicorp, the applications judge was silent on the absence
    of any evidence being elicited from CN. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourthly, the applications judge concluded that
    Metrolinx was entitled to “its easement but the facts and circumstances of this
    case require the easement to be moved to … Part 1.” The easement was not being
    taken away but was being moved. His finding that Metrolinx was entitled to an
    easement is inconsistent with his finding that Metrolinx impliedly abandoned the
    Access Easement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lastly, Metrolinx also submits that the
    applications judge erred in considering certain extraneous factors. It submits
    that he erred by justifying his conclusion in part on the basis that the Access
    Easement was not used and that an alternative route was available, and by
    inferring that CN had acquiesced in moving the Access Easement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lack of use, alternative access, and acquiescence
    are factors to consider in assessing the cogency of the circumstances. However,
    as mentioned, non-use on its own is insufficient. Further, as will be addressed
    below in my discussion of extinguishment by operation of law, alternative
    access becoming available is on its own insufficient to establish abandonment. Finally,
    any potential acquiescence by CN was overtaken by the express terms of the Easement
    Agreement that addressed the very subject matter of the Access Easement in
    clear and unambiguous language and which the applications judge failed to meaningfully
    address.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of these errors, to the extent the applications
    judge rested his decision on a finding of implied release, his decision cannot
    be sustained.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having addressed abandonment by implied release,
    I will now turn to the applications judge’s reliance on operation of law.</span></p>

    analytical clarity and consistent with the terms of the judgment allowing
    Remicorp’s application, it is helpful to address the concepts separately.</span></p>

    extinguishment as being by statute, express or implied release, and by unity of
    ownership and possession of both the dominant and servient tenements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The authors of </span><em>Gale on Easements</em><span
lang=EN-US> describe extinguishment as falling into three categories: by
    operation of law, statute, and release. Operation of law is stated to encompass
    unity of ownership, merger of interests, expiration of a time- limited easement,
    and disappearance of the purpose of an easement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Yet another classification is found in </span><em>Halsbury’s </em><span lang=EN-US>at HRP 315-322. It classifies the methods of
    extinguishment as being by statute, express or implied release, unity of
    ownership, or destruction of either tenement. </span><em>Halsbury’s</em> <span
lang=EN-US>states, at HRP 319, that an easement will be extinguished if it was
    granted with a time limit, or for a purpose, that has expired or come to an end.
    However, the authors include extinguishment resulting from expiry of time or
    end of purpose as a subset of extinguishment by release. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What is to be drawn from all of these
    descriptions?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A reasonable conclusion is that an easement may
    be extinguished by operation of law in two ways. First, it may be extinguished
    by statute. A good example is found in British Columbia’s </span><em>Property
    Law Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.B.C. 1996, ch. 377, s. 35(2), which allows
    the court to modify or cancel an easement where there is, </span><em>inter alia</em><span
lang=EN-US>, a material change in the character of the land such that the
    easement is obsolete. Ontario’s legislation does not mirror that of British Columbia.
    In extinguishing an easement by statute, some caution may be required. As the
    authors of </span><em>Gale on Easements</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>note at para.
    12-12: “An Act should not, however, be construed so as to interfere with
    somebody’s property rights without compensation unless the court is obliged so
    to construe it” citing </span><em>Jones v. Cleanthi</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span lang=EN-US> [2007] 1 W.L.R. 1604,
    at para. 82. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Secondly, an easement may be extinguished by
    operation of the common law. Examples include unity of ownership and possession
    of the dominant and servient lands or destruction of either the dominant or
    servient lands. As seen from </span><em>Anger and Honsberger</em><span
lang=EN-US>, </span><em>Gale on Easements</em><span lang=EN-US>, and </span><em>Halsbury’s</em><span
lang=EN-US>, extinguishment by operation of law also includes expiry of a time-limited
    easement and disappearance or expiry of the purpose for which the easement was
    created. It seems to me that the former would more properly be the subject
    matter of an express or implied release. If an easement is granted for a
    limited time, it follows that it must have been the subject of an express grant
    that expressly or impliedly provided for a release on the expiration of the
    time limit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for expiry of the purpose for which the
    easement was granted, an easement is not typically extinguished by temporary
    events that impact its use. Some permanence must exist. In “Easement Caselaw
    Update”, (paper presented to the Ontario Bar Association, Continuing Legal
    Education Program, Easements for Real Estate and Municipal Lawyers: Level II,
    October 6, 2016), Craig Carter writes that: “An easement can be extinguished as
    a matter of law when some event occurs that makes the easement unusable or
    unnecessary. Some permanence must exist. A flood that washes over an easement
    is not extinguishment. But global warming causing a sea to cover a right of way
    will be.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A further example is found in <em>National
    Guaranteed Manure Co. (Ltd.) v. Donald</em> (1859), 157 E.R. 737, where the
    court held that an easement to take water to fill a canal ceased when the canal
    no longer existed and was converted to a railway.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><span lang=EN-US>Application
    to This Case</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applications judge stated, at para. 21 of
    his reasons: “I also conclude that operation of law is the basis upon which
    Remicorp should succeed.” His analysis on this point was limited. Moreover, as
    mentioned, at para. 23, he spoke of “abandonment” by operation of law, not
    extinguishment. His analysis seemed to focus on whether the reasonable use of
    the Access Easement for its granted purpose persisted. He noted the description
    of the Access Easement as being “exclusive, free, uninterrupted and unobstructed”
    and that “the purpose was to pass over for access to the tracks when or if
    required, not to place or build anything permanent on that land.” He concluded
    that Metrolinx was entitled to its easement, but it was to be moved to Part 1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Read as a whole, the applications judge’s
    reasons suggest that he found abandonment based on operation of law due to
    evidence of lack of use by CN and Metrolinx and his perception that Metrolinx was
    not in immediate need of any easement because the Part 1 pathway had been
    blocked by 12 large concrete blocks. In this regard, he analogized the case to </span><em>Bost
    Properties Inc. v. Highland West Developments Inc.</em><span lang=EN-US>, (2002)
    48 R.P.R. (3d) 83 (Ont. S.C.). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, lack of use and lack of need do
    not amount to extinguishment by operation of law. To the extent that lack of
    need reflects a lack of purpose, the applications judge’s substitution of the
    Part 1 easement is wholly inconsistent with a lack of purpose. Moreover, it
    runs counter to the express terms of the Easement Agreement. In addition, the applications
    judge’s reliance on <em>Bost</em> <em>Properties</em> was misplaced. That case
    involved property in the City of Kitchener that had once been rural but later
    became urbanized. The right-of-way at issue was created by deed in 1954 to
    serve as a laneway to provide access to farm property. The farmhouse no longer
    existed and the farm had ceased operations many years before. What was once an
    area of agricultural use was now dormant land awaiting urban development. The
    trial judge decided that the easement in that case was for a limited purpose
    that had disappeared. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Assuming, without deciding, that the analysis in </span><em>Bost Properties</em><span lang=EN-US> was correct, here the purpose
    associated with the Access Easement – access to the railway lands – cannot be
    said to have disappeared. Indeed, the applications judge acknowledged as much
    by granting an access easement to Metrolinx over Part 1. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This case is more akin to </span><em>Fyfe v.
    James</em><span lang=EN-US> (2006), 42 R.P.R. (4th) 221 (Ont. S.C.), where the
    court held that an access easement was not extinguished after a new, alternate
    access road was built. The court distinguished the facts in </span><em>Bost
    Properties</em><span lang=EN-US>, and rejected the respondents’ argument that,
    because the new road provided full ingress and egress to the relevant
    properties, the right-of-way was no longer necessary and therefore
    extinguished. The grant did not provide for the easement to be extinguished by
    alternative access, nor did it stipulate a time limit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, as in </span><em>Fyfe</em><span
lang=EN-US>, nothing in the three instruments registered on title suggest a
    time limit on the Access Easement. While relocation of the Access Easement is

    of CN. As the option was not exercised, the Access Easement was not
    extinguished.</span></p>

    right; (ii) having found that the Access Easement had been abandoned, the applications
    judge lacked jurisdiction to modify the Access Easement under s.&nbsp;61(1) of
    the CLPA or s. 119(5) of the LTA; and (iii) he failed to apply the proper legal

    judge recognized the validity and effect of the Easement Agreement at paras. 5
    and 15 of his reasons, his decision effectively deprived the Easement Agreement

    Metrolinx the benefit of the Easement Agreement in the absence of evidence of any

    61(1) of the CLPA and s.&nbsp;119(5) of the LTA require that a valid covenant

    59 O.L.R. 574 (C.A.), this court considered whether a modification would be “beneficial
    to the persons principally concerned”, a phrase previously contained in the CLPA
    and which is nearly identical to that found in the LTA. Middleton J.A. stated,
    at pp. 577-578:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The provisions of the statute (12 &amp; 13
    Geo. V. ch. 53) are not easy to interpret. A Judge is empowered to modify or
    discharge building restrictions ‘on proof to his satisfaction that the
    modification will be beneficial to the persons principally concerned.’ If this means
    beneficial to the applicant the provision is senseless, for the relief would
    not be sought unless the applicant deemed it a benefit. If it means beneficial
    to the respondents it is again meaningless, for the respondents would
    undoubtedly release any right they may have if for their benefit. The meaning
    that has been given to the expression in practice is that the Judge must
    satisfy himself that the balance of convenience is in favour of granting the
    application, having regard to the rights and interests of both parties, and I
    think it may safely be said that the order should not be made unless the
    benefit to the applicant greatly exceeds any possible detriment to the
    respondents: </span><em>Re Button</em><span lang=EN-US> (1925), 57 O.L.R. 161.</span></p>

lang=EN-US> in discussing the CLPA, this court stated, at p. 651:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It has been more than once pointed out that
    under this statute there is no power to make compensation to a landowner who is
    prejudicially affected, and the jurisdiction is one to be exercised with the
    greatest caution, and an order should seldom, if ever be made which will in
    truth operate to the prejudice of the adjacent landowner who has any real
    rights. The true function of the statute is to enable the Court to get rid of a
    condition or restriction which is spent and so unsuitable as to be of no value
    and under circumstances when its assertion would be clearly vexatious.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applications judge did not apply these

    the adjacent landowner</span></em><span lang=EN-US>. It is also difficult to
    see how the applications judge could conclude that the modification was
    beneficial to the interested parties. The relocation deprived Metrolinx of its
    rights under the Easement Agreement and results in significant traffic flow at
    the site of the alternative easement on Part 1. With the exception of making
    certain adjustments such as the removal of structures erected without building
    permits, the benefits to Remicorp of relocating the Access Easement are not
    obvious. Indeed, they do not appear to have been considered or identified by
