  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As part of a criminal investigation, Toronto
    police seized a valuable diamond from a pawnbroker, believing it was stolen
    property.  They retained the diamond for the duration of the criminal
    proceedings.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the criminal proceedings were over, the
    pawnbroker successfully brought an application under ss. 490(7) and (9)(c) of
    the </span><em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 <span lang=EN-US>for
    the return of the diamond.  Section 490 of the </span><em>Code</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>contains a comprehensive set of rules for the detention and
    disposition of property seized by peace officers in the execution of their
    duties.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The estate of the individual from whom the
    diamond had been stolen appeals, pursuant to s. 490(17).  It was not given
    notice of the application and says that it was entitled to participate in the
    application, given its ownership interest in the diamond.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND IN BRIEF</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On August 4, 2011, Martin Winberg bought a
    diamond from Guildhall Diamond Investments Inc. for approximately $40,000.  At
    Mr. Winbergs request, an acquaintance agreed to store the diamond at his home.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sometime in the spring of 2012, the acquaintance
    told Mr. Winberg that his friend, Brian Colyer, had stolen the diamond. 
    Apparently, Mr. Colyer had stolen other things as well.  The thefts were
    promptly reported to the Toronto Police Service.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police investigated and soon arrested and
    charged Mr. Colyer.  During the police investigation, the police located the
    diamond at Floward Enterprises Ltd., operating as H. Williams &amp; Company
    (the Pawnbroker).  The police believed that Mr. Colyer had stolen the diamond
    and then pawned it to the Pawnbroker.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, on July 5, 2012, the police took
    possession of the diamond from the Pawnbroker.  It was assigned Property Receipt
    #N956247.  The police retained the diamond throughout the criminal proceedings
    against Mr. Colyer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Martin Winberg died on February 19, 2015.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Around the time that the criminal proceedings
    against Mr. Colyer were concluded, the Pawnbroker learned from the police that
    an individual named Martin Winberg had a potential interest in the diamond
    because he was the person from whom the police believed the diamond had been
    stolen.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Pawnbroker wrote letters to the police
    demanding the immediate release of the diamond to it, asserting its entitlement
    to the diamond.  The police did not comply.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Instead, in a letter dated June 1, 2015,
    addressed to both the lawyer for the deceased and the lawyer for the
    Pawnbroker, the police explained that the prosecution against Mr. Colyer was
    complete, the police no longer needed the diamond, and there were at least two
    adverse claims to it.  In the letter, the police also explained that they were
    not in a position to adjudicate the competing claims to the diamond and that the
    diamond would not be released without either a waiver jointly issued by the
    parties or a court order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was communication between counsel for
    Martin Winbergs estate (the Estate) and counsel for the Pawnbroker about
    entitlement to the diamond.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By letter dated July 6, 2015, counsel for the
    Pawnbroker advised counsel for the Estate that it would commence legal
    proceedings without further notice if it did not hear from the Estate within 10
    days time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 20, 2015, counsel for the Pawnbroker
    again wrote to the police demanding the immediate return of the diamond.  The
    police responded with a letter to both parties in which the police refused to
    release the diamond, reiterated that there were two competing claims to it, and
    asked that the parties use the s. 490 process to settle the dispute.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Michael Winberg is the deceaseds brother.  He
    was appointed the Estate trustee by a certificate of appointment of estate
    trustee with a will annexed, issued on September 11, 2015.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By application dated September 14, 2015, and
    brought under ss. 490(7) and (9)(c) of the </span><em>Code</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>(the Application), the Pawnbroker sought a court order requiring
    the police to return the diamond to it.  The Pawnbroker did not give the Estate
    notice of its Application.  The written material filed on the Application was
    brief and did not mention the Estate or the fact that the Estate was laying claim
    to the diamond.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Application was heard on September 21,
    2015.  The Pawnbroker did not tell the court that there was another interested
    party who might challenge the return of the diamond to it.  Instead, counsel
    for the Pawnbroker stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>So what we have here is a simple application
    for return property under s. 497 [<i>sic</i>] and 499(c) [<i>sic</i>].  The
    property was a diamond. It was seized by police almost three years ago and held
    for investigation.  I understand that the investigation is now complete and we
    just want the property returned.  It was, it was against a third party that it
    was seized for the investigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the Crown appeared on the
    Application.  She took no position on it but offered the court background information
    about the underlying theft investigation.  She advised the court that the
    diamond had been taken from the deceased and pawned to the Pawnbroker, from
    whom the police had seized it.  She also advised the court that she had seen
    some letters that morning which suggested that counsel for the Pawnbroker had
    attempted to contact the deceaseds brother.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel for the Pawnbroker then made the
    following comment to the court:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>If it pleases the court, under this
    application no notice is required to be given to the brother. That being said,
    out of abundance of caution, we have contacted counsel for the [E]state and
    have received no reply and let them know that we would be proceeding for return
    of the property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Application was granted and by order dated
    September 21, 2015 (the Order), the police were required to release the
    diamond to the Pawnbroker.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police forwarded a copy of the Order to the
    Estate.  The Estate moved quickly to bring this appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>THE PARTIES POSITIONS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Estate claims that it was entitled to participate
    in the Application, given its ownership interest in the diamond.  It says that,
    in the circumstances, the application judge erred in law in deciding the
    Application without requiring that notice be given to it.  The Estate also filed
    fresh evidence on the appeal.  On the basis of the fresh evidence, the Estate asks
    this court to order that the diamond be returned to it.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Pawnbroker says that the appeal should be
    dismissed because the Estate failed to assert its interest in the diamond with
    diligence and it should be estopped from asserting any interest now.  The
    Pawnbroker, too, filed fresh evidence to explain the factual circumstances
    leading up to the Application and to buttress its claim to entitlement to the
    diamond.      </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown took a limited role on the appeal.  It
    took no position as to which party is the rightful owner of the diamond nor did
    it take a position on the factual disputes between the claimants.  Its sole
    interest is to protect the integrity of the s. 490 process.  The Crown
    submits that the Pawnbroker failed to make full and frank disclosure in its
    Application and, as a result, it asks this court to set aside the Order.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>THE ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issue on this appeal is whether the Order must be set aside
    as a result of the Application being decided in the absence of full and frank
    disclosure by the Pawnbroker.  If so, the court must also decide whether to
    accede to the Estates request for an order that the diamond be returned to it.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>THE RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 490 is set out in full in Schedule A
    to these reasons.  Sections 490(7), (9) and (10) are the most critical
    provisions for the disposition of this appeal.  They read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=lawlabel><b><span style='color:black'>(7)</span></b></span>&nbsp;A
    person from whom anything has been seized may, after the expiration of the

  <p class=CQuote><span class=lawlabel><span
style='color:black'>(a)</span></span>&nbsp;a judge of a superior court of
    criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 552, where a judge

    lawfully entitled to its possession when the thing is no longer required for
    any criminal investigation or proceeding.  By its own terms, the application
    process is done summarily.  Furthermore, as I have explained, the process under

    points out, absent the requirement of full and frank disclosure, an application

    the mercy of the party seeking injunctive relief.  The ordinary checks and
