    R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23 contains a two-year limitation period, running from the

    S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B, addresses the commencement of the limitation period
    applicable to a claim for contribution and indemnity between joint tortfeasors.
    It provides that a claim for contribution and indemnity is “discovered” and,
    therefore, the limitation period begins to run, on the day on which the
    wrongdoer seeking indemnity is served with the plaintiff’s claim.</span></p>

    makes a crossclaim for indemnity against his or her estate, which limitation
    period applies? If, as in this case, the crossclaim is made more than two years
    after the death of the first tortfeasor, is the second tortfeasor’s claim for
    contribution and indemnity barred by the <em>Trustee Act</em>, even though it
    is made within two years of being served with the plaintiff’s claim? Can the
    claim for indemnity against the estate be time-barred even before the surviving
    tortfeasor is sued?</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the

    was sexually assaulted by a priest, Father Dale Crampton (“Father Crampton”),
    in 1976. Mr. Levesque was 12 years old at the time. Father Crampton pleaded
    guilty to indecent assault and, on appeal to this court, was sentenced to eight
    months’ imprisonment:<em> R. v. D.C. </em>(1987), 22 O.A.C. 47 (C.A.).</span></p>

    Levesque and his family brought this action against Father Crampton’s estate
    and the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Ottawa (“RCECO”), claiming that
    RCECO was vicariously liable for the priest’s conduct and breached independent
    duties owed to Mr. Levesque.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal involves the intersection of three statutes
    – the <em>Negligence Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, the <em>Limitations Act,
    2002</em> and the <em>Trustee Act</em>. A more detailed examination of the
    statutory provisions and their purposes is a necessary starting place for what
    follows.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The </span><em>Negligence Act</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 1 of the <em>Negligence Act </em>creates
    joint and several liability and a right of contribution and indemnity between
    joint tortfeasors. A claim for contribution and indemnity is typically asserted
    by way of crossclaim. However, the right to contribution and indemnity exists
    whether or not the plaintiff has sued the other tortfeasor(s). Section 2
    contains a mechanism for asserting the right. Section 1 provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>Where damages have been caused or
    contributed to by the fault or neglect of two or more persons, the court shall
    determine the degree in which each of such persons is at fault or negligent,
    and, where two or more persons are found at fault or negligent, they are
    jointly and severally liable to the person suffering loss or damage for such
    fault or negligence, but as between themselves, in the absence of any contract
    express or implied, each is liable to make contribution and indemnify each
    other in the degree in which they are respectively found to be at fault or
    negligent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As Feldman J.A. observed in <em>Waterloo Region
    District School Board v. CRD Construction Ltd.</em>, 2010 ONCA 838, 103 O.R.
    (3d) 81,<em> </em>at para. 10, the purpose of contribution and indemnity</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>is to provide a mechanism to ensure that all
    those who caused or contributed to the plaintiff’s loss or damage should share
    the financial responsibility for that loss. Therefore, the basis of the claim
    is that each person who is held liable to the plaintiff for all or part of the
    loss is also liable to contribute or is entitled to receive contribution
    proportionally to or from the other tortfeasors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, RCECO asserted its claim for
    contribution and indemnity against the estate of Father Crampton by way of
    crossclaim.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The </span><em>Limitations Act, 2002</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>,<em> </em>establishes a basic two-year limitation period, running from the day on
    which the claim is discovered. Section 5 sets out rules for determining when a
    claim is discovered. Section 18, which is particularly germane to this case,
    deals with claims for contribution and indemnity:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>18(1) For the purposes of subsection
    5 (2) and section 15, in the case of a claim by one alleged wrongdoer against
    another for contribution and indemnity, the day on which the first alleged
    wrongdoer was served with the claim in respect of which contribution and
    indemnity is sought shall be deemed to be the day the act or omission on which
    that alleged wrongdoer’s claim is based took place.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>(2) Subsection (1) applies whether the
    right to contribution and indemnity arises in respect of a tort or otherwise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, the general two-year limitation period
    runs from the date that the party claiming contribution and indemnity is served
    with the claim in respect of which contribution is sought.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>Canaccord Capital Corp. v. Roscoe</em>,
    2013 ONCA 378, 115 O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 17, Sharpe J.A. observed that “s. 18
    was part of a fundamental and comprehensive reform of the law of limitations in
    Ontario aimed at creating a clear and cohesive scheme for addressing limitation
    issues, one that balances the plaintiff’s right to sue with the defendant’s
    need for certainty and finality.”</span></p>

    to a claim to which the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> applies is of no effect
    unless the provision establishing it is set out in the Schedule to the <em>Limitations,
    Act 2002</em>. Subsection 19(4) provides that if there is a conflict between a
    provision in the other statute and the limitation period established by the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002</em>, the limitation period established by the other statute
    prevails.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In s. 38(3) of the </span><em>Trustee Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>, the limitation period runs from a death. Unlike cases where the
    wording of the limitation period permits the time to run, for example, from “when
    the damage was sustained” (</span><em>Peixeiro</em><span lang=EN-US>) or when
    the cause of action arose (</span><em>Kamloops</em><span lang=EN-US>), there is
    no temporal elasticity possible when the pivotal event is the date of a death.
    Regardless of when the injuries occurred or matured into an actionable wrong,
    s. 38(3) of the </span><em>Trustee Act</em><span lang=EN-US> prevents their
    transformation into a legal claim unless that claim is brought within two years
    of the death of the wrongdoer or the person wronged.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The underlying policy considerations of this
    clear time limit are not difficult to understand. The draconian legal impact of
    the common law was that death terminated any possible redress for negligent
    conduct. On the other hand, there was a benefit to disposing of estate matters
    with finality. The legislative compromise in s. 38 of the </span><em>Trustee
    Act</em><span lang=EN-US> was to open a two-year window, making access to a
    remedy available for a limited time without creating indefinite fiscal
    vulnerability for an estate.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I will first consider whether the <em>Trustee
    Act </em>applies to the crossclaim against the estate of Father Crampton, as
    the appellant asserts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellant’s submission that a
    crossclaim is an “action” and, therefore, falls within s. 38 of the <em>Trustee
    Act. </em>As the appellant notes, a crossclaim is defined as an “action” by rule
    1.03(1) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>. Absent the <em>Trustee Act</em>,
    there would be no mechanism for a claim for contribution and indemnity to be
    brought against an estate. Treating a crossclaim as an action promotes the
    purpose of the legislation, namely to amend the common law rule that a cause of
    action died with the tortfeasor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent argues that s. 38(3) of the <em>Trustee
    Act </em>has no application to a claim for contribution and indemnity against
    the estate of a deceased person. It relies on the wording of s. 38(2), which
    provides, in summary, that if a deceased person has committed a wrong to
    another person, “the person wronged” may maintain an action against the
    executor or administrator of the deceased person. The respondent says that “the
    person wronged” refers to the plaintiff in the action, not to one joint
    tortfeasor who seeks contribution and indemnity from another. Contribution and
    indemnity, it says, is a right conferred by the <em>Negligence Act,</em> with
    its own limitation period under s. 18(1) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, this submission fails for the reason
    set out earlier. There was no right at common law to sue the estate of a
    deceased person. That right is conferred by the </span><em>Trustee Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>. A claim for contribution and indemnity against a deceased person
    can only be made pursuant to the </span><em>Trustee Act</em><span lang=EN-US>.
    Since the purpose of s. 38 of the <em>Trustee Act </em>is to enable claims to
    be brought against estates, it is reasonable to treat a person seeking
    contribution and indemnity as a “person wronged”. The wrong suffered is having
    been required to pay more than the share of damages proportionate to the
    person’s fault. Thus, I reject the respondent’s submission that the <em>Trustee
    Act </em>limitation period has no application.</span></p>
  <h3><em><span style='font-style:normal'>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-US>The </span><em>Limitations Act, 2002</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the limitation period in the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002 </em>is also plainly applicable to the crossclaim, by the combined
    operation of ss. 4, 5 and 18(1). By virtue of ss. 5 and 18(1), the claim for
    contribution and indemnity is discovered on the day the first alleged wrongdoer
    is served with the claim in respect of which contribution and indemnity is
    sought. Section 4 sets out the basic two-year limitation period from the date
    of discovery. There is no merit to the appellant’s submission that s. 18(1)
    applies to claims against a joint tortfeasor, but not to claims against the
    joint tortfeasor’s estate. The estate stands in the place of the deceased.</span></p>

    concluding that this court’s decision in <em>Waterloo </em>was dispositive. In </span><em>Waterloo</em><span
lang=EN-US>, a severe storm blew down the walls of a new school gymnasium. The
    plaintiff sued various parties involved in the construction of the gymnasium,
    including the architects, construction company and engineering firm. Several of
    the defendants brought crossclaims seeking indemnification from the engineering
    firm. The plaintiff’s claim against the engineering firm was statute-barred.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court rejected the argument that because a plaintiff’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But in <em>Waterloo</em>, unlike this case, the
    limitation period applicable to the crossclaim was the “basic” two-year
    limitation period, subject to the deemed discovery rule in s. 18 of the <em>Limitations
    Act, 2002. </em>There was no potential conflict between that limitation period
    and another one, such as s. 38(3) of the <em>Trustee Act. </em>This
    distinguishes <em>Waterloo.</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It also distinguishes <em>Canaccord. </em></span><em>Canaccord</em> <span lang=EN-US>involved an indemnification agreement in an employment
    contract. This agreement required the employee to indemnify Canaccord for any
    claims made against Canaccord arising out of the employee’s acts or omissions.
    Canaccord settled a claim against it and the employee. Canaccord then requested
    indemnification pursuant to the employment agreement, but the employee resisted
    the claim for indemnification. Nearly three years after the delivery of the
    statement of claim, Canaccord brought an action against the employee claiming
    damages for breach of contract. The issue before the court was whether the limitation
    period in s. 18 applied to this type of claim. This court concluded that it
    did.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neither case is authority for the proposition
    that s. 18 trumps other limitation periods. In </span><em>Waterloo</em><span
lang=EN-US> and </span><em>Canaccord</em><span lang=EN-US>, there was no

lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court reached the same conclusion in </span><em>Bikur

    ONCA 196, 94 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 26:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In these circumstances, s. 19(4) is clear. If there is a
    conflict between a limitation period established by a provision referred to in
    s. 19(1), such as s. 38(3), and a limitation period established by any other
    provision of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, the limitation period
    established by a provision such as s. 38(3) prevails.</p>

    motion judge distinguished <em>Bikur Cholim</em> on the basis that it did not
    involve a claim for contribution and indemnity. While this is true, nothing
    about the court’s holding depended on whether the claim was for contribution
    and indemnity or something else. The question was the interaction between a
    limitation period established by a provision of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> (which would include s. 18) and a limitation period set out in the Schedule to
    the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>.</p>

    s. 38(3) of the <em>Trustee Act </em>is a “hard” or absolute limitation period.
    It is triggered by a fixed and known event – the death of the party against
