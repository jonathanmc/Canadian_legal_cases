  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was charged with eight counts <span lang=EN-US>of
    sexual assault of an historical nature. He was acquitted of six counts relating
    to one complainant that were alleged to have taken place in the years 1982 and
    1984. He was convicted of one count of indecent assault and one count of gross
    indecency relating to the complainant TS for which he received a 12-month conditional
    sentence which has now been served. The events in issue took place in 1978. He
    appeals from the two convictions. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>TS was a skater. The appellant became her
    skating coach when she was 14 or 15 years old and he was 21. In the late fall
    of 1978, when she was 16, the complainant asked the appellant to drive her home
    from skating one night. When asked, the appellant hemmed and hawed because he
    had to get back to the rink for his next lesson. In the end, he did drive her
    home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the appellant was self-represented but
    had the assistance of </span><span class=EmphasisBodyChar>amicus</span><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>in the cross-examination of the complainant. Both the complainant
    and the appellant testified. Their descriptions of events on their arrival at the
    complainants home that evening varied.   </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Complainants Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I will first describe the complainants
    evidence. At trial, she testified that when she and the appellant arrived at
    her home, the appellant initially declined her offer to come into her home for
    a drink but moments later, he knocked on the door. She gave him something clear
    to drink, a soft drink or water, and after taking one sip, the appellant told
    her there was something that he always wanted to do. She testified that he then
    kissed her, put his hands down her pants and touched her pubic area. She pushed
    him away and asked, What about your wife, MJ, dont you love her? to which he
    replied that of course he did. He then asked whether she wanted to go upstairs
    for a quickie. She told him that it was not a good idea as her parents were
    not home and the neighbours would be checking on her. The appellant then left.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In cross-examination, the complainant testified
    that although she had a huge crush on the appellant when he was her coach, she was
    angry and scared by his behavior that night. </span><span
class=EmphasisBodyChar>Amicus</span><span lang=EN-US> questioned her about her
    boyfriend (MS), the state of their relationship, and how the complainant
    might have used a false story about their mutual skating coach to make her
    boyfriend jealous:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Q.: Well, I am suggesting that you told your
    boyfriend that you guys were fighting, kind of rocky, and you told him that [the
    appellant] had shown interest in you and your boyfriend went out and confronted
    him in the parking lot?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>A.: I dont know anything about that.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant acknowledged that her
    relationship with MS was rocky at that time, but denied telling him about the
    incident at the time it happened and had no recollection of MS ever confronting
    the appellant in the parking lot of the rink. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant testified that she did not tell
    anyone for a while and only told MS after they both stopped taking lessons from
    the appellant in April 1979. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant went to the police about this
    incident in 2009 after learning of the other charges the appellant was facing.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning then to the appellants evidence, he
    denied all the allegations made against him and denied that he went into the
    complainants house. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> He testified that he was able to drive her home
    and only be a few minutes late for his lessons depending on the traffic. He had
    some 15 minutes while the ice was flooded before his next lesson and he
    calculated that he would be, at most, one to three minutes late if he drove the
    complainant home. He also testified that the ride to her home was about ten
    minutes each way. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He gave evidence on coaching practice at the
    time and testified that the coaching and scheduling arrangements were such that
    he would never ask another coach to watch his students until he arrived. He
    also testified about the strictness of ice time and that coaches were not
    permitted to be on the ice beyond their allocated time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After driving the complainant home, the
    appellant returned to the rink to give his private figure skating lessons. The
    lessons did not have a free skate component where the coach did not need to be
    in attendance.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified in chief that he had a
    confrontation with MS in the parking lot of the skating rink a couple of days
    after he drove the complainant home. He testified that MS asked him why he
    kissed the complainant. He replied that nothing had happened and that he did
    not know what MS was talking about. He told MS that if he had a complaint, he
    should go to the president of the skating club. The appellant was then
    cross-examined on his evidence about this alleged parking lot confrontation and
    his version of events remained unchanged.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial judges Decision</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In reviewing the evidence, the trial judge
    observed that given the appellants testimony that the ride to the
    complainants home was 10 minutes each way, this would suggest that the
    appellant would be at least more than five minutes late for his next lesson. She
    found that the appellants evidence that he could have driven the complainant
    home and returned in time for his next lesson did not ring true, especially in
    light of his apparent conscientiousness as a coach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Stated differently, timing was the focus of
    [the appellants] evidence  the time for the drive to and from [the
    complainants] house, and the timing of the lessons and ice time  and the
    contradictions and inconsistencies on this issue cause me to reject his
    evidence. For these reasons, [the appellants] evidence does not leave me with
    a reasonable doubt about his guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found the complainant to be
    clear and logical in her evidence and her evidence was sequential, common
    sensible and credible. The trial judge was satisfied that the appellant kissed
    and touched the complainant in the manner she described and that she did not
    consent to this activity. Having considered the circumstances as a whole, she
    was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellants guilt. </span></p>

    found that his testimony of professed rigorous adherence to the skating
    schedule such that he could not have spent much time at the complainants home

    the rule against splitting the Crowns case and the collateral fact rule
    attempt to balance fairness to the parties with the need for trial economy: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>They are designed, so far as is possible, to

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>There is a well-known principle that evidence

    other words, the law regards it as unfair for the Crown to lie in wait and to

    evidence which is only marginally, minimally or doubtfully relevant.</span></p>

    appellants submissions. The appellant argues that, in compliance with the rule
    in </span><em>Browne v. Dunn</em><span lang=EN-US> (1893), 6 R. 87 (H.L. (Eng.), </span><em>amicus</em><span lang=EN-US> questioned the complainant on the
    confrontation between MS and the appellant and on when she told MS about the
    incident. He submits that the issue of MSs evidence was therefore foreshadowed
    by </span><em>amicus</em><span lang=EN-US> cross-examination of the
    complainant and the Crown was on notice to call evidence on the issue in its
    case in chief.</span></p>

    v. Dunn</em><span lang=EN-US>, as a general matter, may<i> </i>give notice of

    however, that every suggestion put to a witness in compliance with the rule in </span><em>Browne
    v. Dunn</em><i><span lang=EN-US>, </span></i><span lang=EN-US>or any question
    which foreshadows a possible attack on a witnesss credibility, necessitates
    the Crown calling evidence on the issue in its case in chief. Such a rule would
    amount to chasing after every shadow. This is particularly true where the
    witness has not accepted a suggestion advanced and where, at the end of the
    Crowns case, the witness has not been successfully impeached and there is no
    need to rehabilitate the witness: </span><em>G.P.</em>,<span lang=EN-US> at p.

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, while a cross-examination may reveal
    part or all of an accuseds defence or version of events, the relevance of a
    particular line of inquiry may be only marginal at this stage. As stated in </span><em>McWilliams
    Canadian Criminal Evidence</em><span lang=EN-US>, loose-leaf, 5th ed. (Toronto:
    Thomson Reuters Canada Limited, 2017), at para. 21:50:60: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[] Sometimes the Crown learns of a possible
    defence </span><em>before</em><span lang=EN-US> the close of its case, for
    example through questions asked during the cross-examination of prosecution
    witnesses, or as a result of out-of-court communications with defence counsel.
    Crown counsel thus knows that certain evidence may, or even will, be required
    to counter the anticipated defence. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Nonetheless, in such circumstances the rule
    against case-splitting does <i><u>not </u></i><u>impose a general obligation to
    lead the countering evidence as part of the prosecution case in chief. This is
    so because Crown counsel will often be unsure whether the defence will be
    called, and even where certain on this point will usually be unaware of its
    precise contours and/or the specific evidence to be presented in support. To
    force the Crown to call evidence to refute an anticipated defence would thus
    frequently waste court time and create confusion, and may also cause unfairness

    J.A. held that even though the accuseds version of events was foreshadowed by
    the cross-examination of the complainant, its relevance was only marginal at

    the story to make her boyfriend jealous, thus prompting a confrontation. The
    reply evidence became necessary to provide the trial judge with accurate facts
    of what happened after the assault and, from the Crowns perspective, correct
    the distorted picture created by the appellants evidence that the complainant
    was motivated to make a false allegation and use the false story to make MS

    advantage in favour of the Crown, nor that the appellant was caught off guard
    by the evidence. It was the appellant who anticipated the issue through his
    cross-examination of the complainant. Moreover, the Crown was not in
    possession of any evidence from MS. It is apparent from the transcript that he
    had not given a statement to the police and that the Crown did not anticipate
    MS to be a witness in the proceedings. Lastly, it bears noting that this was a
    judge alone trial and the risk that the late introduction of the evidence might
    magnify its importance beyond what was warranted is much less significant: </span><em>R.

    was within the trial judges discretion to permit MS to be called in reply in
    this judge alone trial. Moreover, the evidence provided the trial judge with a
    more complete and accurate picture of what actually happened. The appellant
    incurred no prejudice as a result of the trial judges decision to allow the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The effect of the collateral fact rule is
    that, subject to certain exceptions, a party is not entitled to introduce
    extrinsic evidence to contradict the testimony of an adversarys witness unless
    that extrinsic evidence is relevant to some other issue in the case other than
    merely to contradict the witness.</span></p>

class=EmphasisBodyChar> </span><span lang=EN-US>(Toronto: Carswell, Thomson
    Canada Limited, 2002), describes the rule as follows at para. 22.03, p. 265:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The collateral facts rule prohibits the
    introduction of evidence for the </span><span class=EmphasisBodyChar>sole</span><span
lang=EN-US> purpose of </span><span class=EmphasisBodyChar>contradicting</span><span
lang=EN-US> a witness testimony concerning a collateral fact. The rule seeks
    to avoid confusion and proliferation of issues, wasting of time and
    introduction of evidence of negligible assistance to the trier of fact in
    determining the real issues of the case. It endeavours to ensure that the
    sideshow does not take over the circus. </span><span class=Underline>In general</span><span
lang=EN-US>, matters that relate wholly and </span><span
class=EmphasisBodyChar>exclusively</span><span lang=EN-US> to the credibility
    of a non-accused witness are collateral, hence beyond the reach of
    contradictory evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant asserts that the only purpose of
    allowing MS to testify in reply was to impeach the appellants credibility by
    suggesting that his narrative was inaccurate. I disagree. MSs evidence in this
    case was relevant to more than a general attack on the appellants credibility.
    If believed, the evidence of MS could undermine the defence position that the
    complainant was an emotional teenager who, angry at the appellant because she
    was not special to him, and in the midst of a rocky relationship with her
    boyfriend, fabricated a story of sexual assault, then told that story to her
    boyfriend, which in turn resulted in a confrontation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The question of whether or not a confrontation
    happened goes to understanding the context and, in my view, bears directly on
    the question of whether the complainant had a reason to fabricate a story, and
    ultimately, on whether a reasonable doubt was raised. Rosenberg J.A. observed
    in </span><span class=EmphasisBodyChar>G.P.</span><span lang=EN-US> at p. 516: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>As part of the defence case, the appellant was entitled to lead
    evidence to show that Ms. P. had a motive for falsely testifying and for
    putting her daughter up to making a false allegation: see <span
class=EmphasisBodyChar>R. v. Busby</span><span
style='color:windowtext'> (1982), 75 Cr. App. R. 79</span> (C.C.A.); <span
class=EmphasisBodyChar>R. v. Shaw</span><span
style='color:windowtext'> (1888), 16 Cox C.C. 503</span>. The appellant's
    evidence, if believed, cast the relationship between him and Ms. P. in an
    entirely different light. That evidence not only contradicted Ms. P. but
    provided a motive on the part of Ms. P. to fabricate her evidence. The Crown
    was then entitled to lead evidence, if it had any, to rehabilitate its witness
    by showing that she did not have the motive to fabricate alleged against her.
    The motive of the complainant to falsely charge the appellant was an essential
    element of the case. It was central to the theory of the defence and as the
    case was developed by the defence the relationship between Ms. P. and the
    appellant related to that question. Viewed this way, evidence concerning motive
    to fabricate could not be collateral. </p>

    para. 130:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellant that admission of
    this evidence would not offend the collateral fact rule.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>                                        </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the cousins evidence would not
    merely contradict the complainants assertion that she did not swear at the
    appellant on the occasion in question. The evidence, if believed, could
    undermine the complainants assertion that the appellant, rather than she, was
    the verbally abusive party in the relationship. It could also undermine her
    broad assertion that she would never swear at the appellant for fear that he
    would abuse her.</span></p>

    therefore would not give effect to the appellants submission on the collateral
