  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault,
    sexual interference, and invitation to sexual touching following a trial by
    judge alone. The sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching convictions
    were stayed pursuant to </span><em>Kienapple </em><span lang=EN-US>and the
    appellant was sentenced to a term of 8 years imprisonment. He appeals from
    conviction, submitting that the judge made palpable and overriding errors in
    making the credibility assessments that were central to the case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the appeal with reasons to follow.  These are those reasons. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant, the appellants step-daughter,
    complained of a series of incidents that occurred when she was between 5 and 14
    years of age. She first discussed the allegations with the police when she was
    15 years old. She was 19 years old at the time of trial.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence</span></h1>

lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant testified that the first
    incident occurred when she was five years old. She was in the bathtub with the
    appellant when he asked to put his penis into her mouth. The appellant
    testified that she was assaulted two to three times weekly until she was 14
    years old. The assaults involved oral and anal sex and occurred in the family
    home, and later at the appellants apartment, following his separation from the
    complainants mother. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The assaults occurred following requests from
    the complainant to go somewhere or to do something, and later for money or
    electronics. The complainant testified that the appellant would tell her that
    she had to do something in return. He would sometimes use a hand gesture, or
    stick his finger in the middle of her bum and press, especially if the
    complainants half-sister R.L. was present.</span></p>

    appellant was wonderful with the complainant and she was very attached to him
    emotionally and related to him as a father. The complainant and R.L. continued
    to visit the appellant after he moved out of the family home. A.C. testified,
    further, that the complainant had attempted suicide shortly after telling her
    about her allegations against the complainant.</span></p>

    that the complainant would visit the appellant and her twice weekly. She said
    that she was always home when the complainant visited and would not leave the
    apartment on her own. She testified that she was trying to learn English but
    could not speak it. She testified that the complainants behaviour changed once
    she learned that A.D.S. was pregnant, and that she kinda didnt like it.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified and denied all of the
    complainants allegations. He acknowledged being naked in the bathtub taking a
    bubble bath with the complainant when she was young, but saw nothing wrong with
    this because it was as if he were the complainants father.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(b)</span><span
lang=EN-US> She also acknowledged a history of drug and alcohol abuse, as well
    as other psychological issues that she had at the time. The complainants
    testimony in this regard actually enhances her credibility, rather than
    diminishing it, as she is able to recognize her own frailties.</span></p>

    allegation against the accused meant that another allegation that was not

    concern specific allegations that went to the core of her complaint against the
    accused, as in </span><em>D.T.</em> <span lang=EN-US>The complainants
    acknowledgment of selective dishonesty was a general description of her
    behaviour between the ages of 10 and 14. She did not recant a specific

    v.</em> <em>R.W.</em>, [1992] 2 SCR 122, at p. 134, <span lang=EN-US>there are
    no hard and fast rules as to when a witnesss evidence should be assessed by
    reference to adult or child standards. Read as a whole, the trial judges
    reasons demonstrate that he appreciated the need to determine the reliability
    of the complainants evidence having regard to her age at the relevant time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simply because the trial judge did not advert to all four areas concerning
    the complainants alleged lack of recollection in making his credibility finding
    does not mean that he ignored this evidence. Indeed, much of it was set out in
    the trial judges thorough summary of the evidence. <span lang=EN-US>The trial
    judge carefully considered the evidence and there is no basis for concluding
    that he erred in doing so. The trial judge was not required to refer to every
    piece of evidence in making his credibility and reliability findings. The trial
    judges reasons for accepting the evidence were not inadequate. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in finding that A.D.S.s testimony  that she would not leave the small
    apartment she shared with the appellant unless the appellant was with her  was
    not credible. The appellant says this finding was based on speculation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    small. It requires no speculative leap to be skeptical of A.D.S.s testimony,
    which would have resulted in her remaining at the small apartment alone for
    long periods of time while the appellant was away working full-time, and
    remaining at the apartment during the complainants visits even though she
    could not speak to the complainant without English translation. The trial
    judges finding that A.D.S.s evidence on this point was difficult to accept
    is entitled to deference. In any event, the trial judge clearly understood the
    import of the appellants wifes evidence. He found that it did not raise a
    reasonable doubt.</span></p>

    finding that the appellant would give the complainant gifts in exchange for
    sexual acts is undermined in the context of the complainants evidence that
    there were hundreds of assaults. The appellant submits, further, that the trial
    judge failed to consider A.C.s evidence that the disparity in gifts the
    appellant gave the complainant compared to R.L. was the result of R.L.s
    passive nature in requesting gifts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was ample evidence, such as the evidence
    of the complainants mother, to support the trial judges finding that there
    was a disparity in gifts given by the appellant to the complainant and R.L.,
    and it was open to him to accept the complainants evidence that the disparity
    reflected an exchange associated with the sexual assaults. The trial judge was entitled
    to reject the inference that the disparity in gifts was because R.L. did not
    ask for gifts  an inference that ran counter to the appellants evidence that
    he treated the complainant and R.L. equally. Although the trial judge did not
    mention A.C.s evidence concerning R.L. not asking for gifts, he made no error
    in doing so. As indicated, a trial judge is not required to refer to every
    piece of evidence in making his decision. </span></p>

    jealousy of the appellants wifes pregnancy.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge dealt briefly with the jealousy
    issue, stating that the appellants evidence that he did not see any problems
    in the relationship between A.D.S. and the complainant in the summer of 2010
    contradicted the argument put forward by his counsel. He did not refer to all
    of the evidence in reaching this conclusion, but was under no obligation to do
    so. The trial judge did mention the complainants preliminary inquiry evidence,
    and earlier in his decision set out A.D.S.s evidence that her relationship with
    the complainant had changed once the complainant learned that she was pregnant.
    The trial judges description of the evidence as very limited may be inapt,
    but in our view the trial judges conclusion that the evidence before him did
    not demonstrate a motivation on the part of the complainant to lie was open to
    him on the record.</span></p>
