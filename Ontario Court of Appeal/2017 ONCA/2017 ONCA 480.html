  <h1><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant has twice been tried and convicted
    of sexual offences involving two teenaged girls from the Netherlands who stayed
    at his family home for several weeks, one in 1997 and the other in 2001. The
    appellant’s convictions at his first trial were overturned by this court on
    appeal and a new trial was ordered: 2013 ONCA 62.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The principal issue on this appeal is whether
    the trial judge erred in her treatment of the evidence from the appellant’s
    first trial – evidence proffered by the appellant in an attempt to undermine
    the credibility and reliability of one of the complainants. The appellant
    brings a fresh evidence application in support of this argument, seeking to
    have transcripts of the evidence of one of the witnesses from the first trial
    admitted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant further argues that the trial
    judge misapprehended evidence and assessed the evidence of the complainants and
    the appellant with uneven scrutiny.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would not admit
    the fresh evidence and would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainants are the daughters of J.M., a
    former friend and business associate of the appellant from the Netherlands.
    F.M., then 14 years of age, visited Canada and stayed with the appellant and
    his family for several weeks during the summer of 1997. The appellant, then
    aged 35, was married to his first wife, K.F., with whom he had two sons, ages two
    and four. J.M.’s other daughter, M.M., stayed with the appellant and his family
    for several weeks during the summer of 2001, when she was 15 years old. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2006, F.M. and M.M. told each other that they
    had each been sexually involved with the appellant during their visits. They
    gave statements to the Dutch police in February 2007 and video-recorded
    statements to the Halton Regional police in September 2008, following which the
    appellant was charged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was initially charged with four
    counts of sexual assault and six counts of sexual exploitation. He was
    acquitted of the four sexual assault counts on a directed verdict. A jury
    convicted him of four counts of sexual exploitation but acquitted him of the
    two other exploitation charges. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court allowed the appellant’s conviction appeal
    with the Crown’s consent, quashed his convictions, and ordered a new trial. The
    acquittals from the appellant’s first trial stood.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was retried on four counts of
    sexual exploitation, two against each complainant. The trial judge found the
    appellant guilty on all four counts.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>THE EVIDENCE AT THE SECOND TRIAL</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>F.M.</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>F.M. testified that she was treated as a mature
    young woman by the appellant and K.F. She recounted discussions with K.F. and
    the appellant concerning sexuality that included the appellant’s sexual
    prowess, his sex life with his wife, his penis, orgasms, and thong underwear. She
    testified that the appellant bought thong underwear for her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>F.M. testified that a series of sexual acts took
    place with the appellant during her visit, often while K.F. and/or the
    appellant’s children were nearby. The acts began shortly after she arrived.
    F.M. testified that the appellant gave her a massage and asked her to remove
    her shirt and bra. F.M. complied and the appellant massaged her breasts. On
    another occasion, F.M. said that she saw the appellant naked in his bedroom,
    showing his genitalia and acting flirtatiously.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>F.M. testified that she performed fellatio on
    the appellant on a regular basis. She described several incidents, including
    fellating the appellant after she awoke to find his penis in her face; being
    summoned on the house intercom to come to the basement by the appellant and
    performing fellatio at his request; and fellating the appellant as he drove to
    the family cottage, while his sons were in the back seat of the car. At the
    cottage, she described skinny-dipping with the appellant and said that he
    inserted his fingers into and licked her vagina. She also performed fellatio on
    the appellant in the cottage kitchen.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>F.M. testified that the appellant never told her
    not to tell anyone and never forced her to do anything. On the contrary, she
    testified that she was comfortable with the appellant and was attracted to him,
    and that she was sometimes proactive in initiating the sexual activity. She did
    not think it was wrong, apart from the fact that the appellant was married.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>F.M. testified that for a long time she never
    discussed what had occurred with anyone, except for a soccer training friend on
    her return to the Netherlands, and then not in detail. Several years later,
    when her sister M.M. was contemplating visiting Canada and staying at the
    appellant’s home, F.M. said that she cautioned her about going “because things
    had happened” between her and the appellant. However, she did not provide any
    details about what had happened. She warned her sister not to let the appellant
    give her a massage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>F.M. testified that she recalled having a drink
    with the appellant some years later, when he visited her family in the
    Netherlands, and that she told him she could ruin his life.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>M.M.</span></h2>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>M.M. gave a similar description of F.M.’s
    warning. She testified that F.M. told her she should not go to Canada because sexual
    things had happened with the appellant, and she was concerned the same things
    would happen to her. She said that F.M. did not describe in detail what had
    happened, but told her not to allow the appellant to give her a massage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>M.M. decided to go to Canada despite F.M.’s
    warning, and stayed at the appellant’s home for several weeks during the summer
    of 2001. She testified that the appellant massaged her and touched her breasts.
    She found the encounter “a little bit interesting” and said that the appellant
    was very nice to her. On another occasion, he kissed her with his tongue in her
    mouth, performed cunnilingus and licked her anus. She then performed fellatio
    on the appellant. M.M. said that the appellant made her feel special and

    sexual touching alleged by M.M. to have occurred at the appellant’s cottage. At
    the first trial, the appellant was acquitted of the sexual exploitation charge that
    arose out of this allegation. The mouse incident was not related to the sexual
    exploitation charges the appellant was facing at the second trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nevertheless, defence counsel sought permission
    to cross-examine M.M. and call evidence to rebut the allegation in order to
    undermine her credibility and reliability concerning the sexual exploitation
    charges at the second trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Crown counsel initially objected to defence
    counsel’s cross-examination request, but later withdrew his objection, provided
    that he was permitted to re-examine M.M. without complaint that he was
    splitting his case. The Crown objected outright to defence counsel’s request to
    call contradictory evidence on the basis that it violated the collateral fact
    rule. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge allowed the defence request. She
    reasoned that neither issue estoppel nor the collateral fact rule prevented the
    appellant from cross-examining M.M. on the mouse incident and calling
    contradictory evidence. With respect to issue estoppel, the trial judge noted
    that the mouse incident had been litigated at the appellant’s first trial.
    However, contradicting M.M. would accord with, rather than undermine, the
    jury’s verdict. The rationale underlying the doctrine of issue estoppel –
    fairness to the accused, judicial finality, and coherence of the criminal
    process – would not be undermined by allowing the appellant to contradict M.M.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then concluded that
    contradicting M.M. on the mouse incident would not run afoul of the collateral
    fact rule. She reasoned that the probative value of the proposed evidence was
    significant: it was proffered to show M.M. made a false allegation against the
    same appellant around the same time as the allegations before the court. She
    found the potential prejudice contemplated by the collateral fact rule –
    prolonged litigation and distraction – to be low.  </span></p>

    cross-examine M.M. on the mouse incident and to call evidence to rebut the
    allegation. In addition to the appellant, the defence called two witnesses to
    contradict M.M.’s version of events: V.B. and D.M – both guests at the appellant’s
    cottage that night. The Crown was permitted to re-examine M.M. on issues raised
    in cross-examination, and to call rebuttal evidence before closing its case.

    emphasized that she was not simply choosing between evidence given by the other

    she could have to dissuade M.M. from coming to Canada to stay with the

lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The mouse incident involved collateral facts, as
    the rule is traditionally understood. Whether the appellant’s sexual encounter
    with M.M. at the cottage occurred was neither material nor relevant to the
    material facts in issue concerning the sexual exploitation charged in the
    indictment. It was relevant only to M.M.’s credibility. Thus, although defence
    counsel could cross-examine M.M. about the mouse incident, in the normal course
    the collateral fact rule precluded the calling of rebuttal evidence to
    contradict her version of events.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, the
    trial judge did not err in admitting the rebuttal evidence. The collateral fact
    rule is not absolute. As the Supreme Court recognized in </span><em>R. v.
    R.(D.)</em><span lang=EN-US>, </span>[1996] 2 S.C.R. 291, evidence that
    undermines a witness’s credibility may escape the exclusionary reach of the collateral
    fact rule if credibility is central to the case against an accused.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The three accused in <em>R.(D.)</em> were charged with sexually
    assaulting D.’s three young children. They sought to undermine the
    complainants’ credibility by cross-examining their therapist on her interview
    techniques to prove that the children had been coached or manipulated. The
    majority of the Supreme Court held, at p. 313, that the accused was entitled to
    contradict the complainants:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The credibility of the children was at the heart of the case
    against the appellants…Any evidence that might have cast doubt on the
    children's credibility, or that might show that the children had been subjected
    to coaching and manipulation, was evidence that would have been crucial to the
    appellants' case.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sexual touching in this case was alleged by
    the same complainant against the same accused during the same timeframe as the
    exploitation counts in the indictment, albeit that they occurred at a different
    location – the family cottage rather than the family home. If the alleged touching
    did not occur, M.M.’s credibility and reliability – central to the case – would
    be compromised significantly. In these circumstances, it was open to the trial
    judge to conclude that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its
    prejudicial effect and that rebuttal evidence should be permitted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court has twice refused to permit an
    accused to cross-examine a complainant on prior sexual assault allegations and
    then call the alleged perpetrators to contradict the complainant, on the basis
    that the evidence would offend the collateral fact rule: </span><em>R. v. Riley</em> (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 151, leave to appeal refused, [1993] 2 S.C.R. x; and <em>R.
    v. B.(A.R.) </em>(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 361, aff’d 2000 SCC 30, [2000] 1 S.C.R.
    781. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the concerns underpinning the decisions in <em>Riley </em>and <em>B.(A.R.) </em>do not arise in this case. The prior sexual assault allegations in those cases
    were made against third parties, and the court was rightly concerned about
    confusing the process by introducing a litany of marginally relevant issues for
    the trier of fact to decide. As the majority in <em>B.(A.R.)</em> noted, at p. 366:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he tactic of the defence is directed to creating confusion
    by having the jury consider not one criminal case but four or five in the hope
    that by discrediting at least one of her allegations of sexual abuse, he can
    raise a reasonable doubt as to the Crown's case on the charges on which it
    elected to proceed.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>In other words, the proposed evidence would cause the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mouse incident evidence was not aimed at “creating confusion”. It
    was limited to a specific sexual allegation made by one of the complainants against
    the accused. It did not unduly lengthen or complicate the proceedings, nor did
    it introduce a sideshow of ancillary issues that had to be resolved. Finally,
    M.M. was not unfairly surprised by the cross-examination <span lang=EN-US>– she
    had testified concerning </span>the mouse incident at the appellant’s first

    to admit evidence concerning sexual assault allegations by the complainant
    against a third party, the court stated, at p. 154:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The only legal basis of which we are aware that would justify
    the cross-examination of this complainant along the lines suggested would be in
    order to lay the foundation for a pattern of fabrication by the complainant of
    similar allegations of sexual assault against other men. This should not be
    encouraged unless the defence is in a position to establish that the
    complainant has recanted her earlier accusations or that they are demonstrably
    false.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Riley</em> does not establish a higher evidentiary threshold ­­­<span
lang=EN-US>– </span>demonstrable falsehood <span lang=EN-US>– </span>that must
    be met before evidence rebutting a prior sexual assault allegation may be
    considered. Rather, <em>Riley </em>limits the scope of cross-examination on a
    prior allegation. Properly understood, this passage in <em>Riley</em> is no
    more than an iteration of the basic evidentiary principle that only relevant
    evidence is admissible: see e.g. <em>R. v. Cloutier</em>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 709,
    at pp. 730-31. If the defence is unable to establish that a complainant has
    recanted a prior allegation or that it is demonstrably false, the fact the
    allegation was made loses its relevance: see <em>R. v. M.T.</em>, 2012 ONCA

lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, once the trial judge decided to allow
    cross-examination and to admit contradictory evidence on the mouse incident,

    allegations that were before the court. In other words, the evidence could only

    use the mouse incident in making her credibility findings – the so-called

    witness” and said that not calling her was a factor to be considered, she also
    stated that K.F. would have been a compellable witness for either or the Crown
    or the defence. In other words, her testimony could have confirmed or

    failed to explain her decision to reject the evidence of D.M. and V.B., and
    that she wrongly differentiated their evidence from that of A.H. on the basis
    that A.H. had a positive memory of what had occurred, whereas D.M. and V.B. had
    no recollection that K.F. had invited M.M. to sleep in the appellant’s bedroom

    not necessarily better evidence than testimony that it did not. But in any
    event, the positive characterization of A.H.’s memory does little work in the
    context of the analysis as a whole. The trial judge accepted that A.H., D.M.,
    and V.B. all were attempting to tell the truth and that each of them was
    credible. There were necessarily inconsistencies and shortcomings in their
    evidence years after the incident. However, the trial judge was entitled to
    accept the evidence of A.H. and she did so. A.H. had a memory of the incident
    that, as the Crown submitted, would be peculiar for her to make up or imagine. Her
    memory coincided with M.M.’s evidence. Contrary to the appellant’s submission,
    the trial judge did not err in stating that A.H. had no reason to give evidence
    favourable to M.M. A.H. testified that she had “nothing but love and respect”
    for the appellant. The trial judge’s reasons on this point were relatively
    brief, but they are not inadequate.</span></p>

    issues going to the appellant’s opportunity to commit the offences. The trial
    judge found that the appellant’s answers were inaccurate and contradicted by

    F.M. was in Canada. The Crown properly concedes that it would have been better if

    insignificant in the context of the reasons as a whole. Alleged misapprehension

    or the record that demonstrate that different standards were applied in
    assessing the evidence: </span><em>R. v. J.H. </em><span lang=EN-US>(2005), 192
    C.C.C. (3d) 480 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 59.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge was
    “unfairly critical” of the appellant’s evidence; that she “did not cut the
    Appellant any slack because of the passage of time”; and that she was “far more
    generous and understanding” when it came to assessing the complainants’ testimony.
    The appellant describes the trial judge’s treatment of the shortcomings of the
    complainants’ evidence as using “eerily similar” language.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The trial judge was alive to the difficulties in the case. The
    passage of time made it difficult for the complainants to be precise about the
    events they were describing and difficult for the appellant to defend against
    their complaints. But when the record is viewed as a whole, it simply cannot be
    said that the trial judge did not approach the evidence in an evenhanded
    manner. The appellant’s problem is not with the way in which his evidence was
    scrutinized; it is with the fact that the trial judge did not believe his
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge was aware of the possibility of collusion by the
    complainants. She noted key differences in their accounts: F.M. said that the
    appellant had never kissed her, while M.M. said that he did kiss her; and M.M.
    said that the appellant licked her anus while F.M. made no such claim. The
    appellant’s description of the language chosen by the judge in discussing the
    evidence of the complainants as “eerily similar” is, in my view, unwarranted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The weakness of the uneven scrutiny ground of appeal in this case is
    matched by the baldness of its assertion. The appellant groups several defence
    arguments, including the unlikelihood that the appellant would act so
    recklessly with the daughters of his friend; his limited opportunity to have
    committed the offences; the presence of his wife, nanny, friends and his own
    children; and the appellant’s action in taking M.M. to New York to see F.M.,
    and states simply that they were “dismissed in a manner that suggested that the
    trial judge was applying different standards of scrutiny”. This does not begin
    to approach the burden required to establish an uneven scrutiny argument. Nor,
    for the reasons outlined above, can it be said that the trial judge applied
    different standards of scrutiny in rejecting the evidence of D.M. and V.B.
    concerning the mouse incident. It is simply the case that the trial judge
    preferred the evidence of M.M. and A.H., and she was entitled to do so.</span></p>
