  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard and released orally: June 1, 2017</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on February 6, 2013
    and the sentence imposed on May 2, 2013 by Justice Howard I. Chisvin of the Ontario
    Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of four counts of sexual interference and
    four counts of sexual assault of his daughter, from ages 11 to 14. The four
    counts of sexual assault were stayed pursuant to <em>R. v. Kienapple</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729</span></em>. He was sentenced
    to 18 months in addition to pre-trial custody. The appellant appeals his
    convictions on two grounds: 1) his s. 11(b) <i>Charter </i>right was infringed
    due to unreasonable delay in completing the trial; 2) the trial judge erred in
    his analysis of the credibility of the complainant by: reversing the burden of
    proof, misusing the finding of no motive to fabricate, and by misapprehending
    some of the evidence on that issue. </p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unreasonable delay</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial was completed in 2013 but is now governed by the decision of
    the Supreme Court Canada in <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R.
    631. The trial was held in the Ontario Court of Justice so that the presumptive
    ceiling to verdict is 18 months. Although this case took just under 36 months
    to complete to verdict, on this appeal, counsel for the appellant fairly
    submitted that the appeal turns on the characterization of the 11-month
    adjournment of the trial from June 2011 to May 2012. He also fairly conceded
    that some of that time could be attributed to the defence but that the rest was
    institutional delay. The Crown’s position is that the entire adjournment period
    is attributable to the defence. We agree with that submission. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The adjournment was required because defence counsel at trial did not
    comply with s. 276.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> by deciding not to bring an
    application in writing to cross-examine the complainant on an incident of
    alleged prior sexual activity (in this case, another assault). The Crown sought
    to tender the video statement of the complainant under s. 715.1 of the <em>Code</em>,
    but with the alleged sexual assault incident edited out. Defence objected and
    took the position that the Crown was required to justify the editing. Although
    Crown counsel had given defence counsel written notice asking counsel to bring
    the necessary application, counsel did not do so, and the issue was addressed
    at the opening of trial and led to the need to adjourn. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the time set for the trial was only two days, when the adjournment
    was needed, the Crown sought both a date for the application as well as a
    separate four day trial period. That four day period could not be given by the
    court until the following May.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with Crown counsel on the appeal that the defence position at
    trial in June 2011 was frivolous, as a s. 276 application was required, as
    subsequently ruled by the trial judge. In para. 63 of <em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> the Supreme Court identifies taking
    frivolous positions as conduct by the defence that is defence delay that will
    be subtracted from the presumptive ceiling. As a result, we find there was no
    s. 11(b) breach based on <em>Jordan</em>. We similarly reject the submission
    that it was an error by the trial judge in the s. 11(b) analysis he conducted under <em>R. v. Morin</em>,<i> </i>[1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, not to characterize the 11-month
    adjournment as institutional delay.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The credibility findings of the trial judge</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also reject the submission that the trial judge erred in his
    credibility analysis. The objection on appeal is based on the structure of the
    trial judge’s reasons. The appellant called only one witness who did not
    testify as to the events of the alleged sexual assaults. Therefore the only
    witness on that issue was the complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed her evidence and he identified some
    inconsistencies, but found that they were not significant enough to make her
    unbelievable and not credible. He then found that her credibility was enhanced by
    the absence of a motive to fabricate. It was not in her interest to fabricate the
    allegations because the result of that could have been that she would no longer
    be able to live at her father’s home in Stouffville and might have to return to
    live either with her mother, who was homeless, or to go into foster care. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the trial judge’s approach. As Doherty J.A. stated in <em>R. v. Batte</em> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) at para. 120, absence of
    motive to fabricate is a factor that can be taken into account in assessing
    credibility. In this case there was also no error as in <em>R. v. L.L.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2009 ONCA 413, 96 O.R. (3d) 412</span></em>, where
    the accused was asked to speculate on the motive to fabricate. Nor did the
    trial judge misapprehend the evidence regarding the complainant’s feelings
    about her life in Stouffville and the alternatives open to her. His findings
    and inferences were supported by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the approach of the trial judge did not reverse the burden of
    proof. He accepted the complainant’s un-contradicted evidence about the sexual
    assaults and determined that he believed her. His reasons disclose no error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore dismissed. </p>
