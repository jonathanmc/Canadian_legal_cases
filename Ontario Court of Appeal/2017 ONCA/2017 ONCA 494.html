  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court
    (Justices Edward F. Then, Anne M. Molloy and Thomas R. Lederer concurring)
    dated December 9, 2015, with reasons reported at 2015 ONSC 7345, reversing the
    orders of Justice Paul M. Perell dated July 29, 2014 and November 4, 2014, with
    reasons reported at 2014 ONSC 4503, 58 C.P.C. (7th) 37 and 2014 ONSC 6366, 59
    C.P.C. (7th) 248.</p>
  <p><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At issue on this appeal is whether solicitors who have allegedly
    violated the <em>Solicitors Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 15 (the “Act”), are
    immune from a class proceeding brought on behalf of their former and current
    clients. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, personal injury lawyer Gary Neinstein and his firm
    Neinstein &amp; Associates LLP (collectively the “Firm”), challenge the
    Divisional Court’s decision certifying an application, which was brought by representative
    plaintiff Cassie Hodge against the Firm, under the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em>, <i>1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (the “CPA”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court certified 19 common issues. These include common
    issues relying on a breach of s. 28.1(8) of the Act.  Section 28.1(8) states
    that a contingency fee agreement (“CFA”) shall not include in the fee payable
    to the lawyer any amount arising as a result of an award of costs or costs
    obtained as part of a settlement in addition to a percentage fee unless certain
    conditions are met. The certified common issues also include whether the Firm
    charged interest contrary to s. 33 of the Act, and whether that amounted to a
    breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Firm argues that the application brought by Ms. Hodge, who is a former
    client of the Firm, should not have been certified as it fails to disclose a
    cause of action, fundamentally lacks in commonality and fails the preferable
    procedure requirement. In particular, the Firm argues that ss. 23-25 of the Act
    preclude the possibility of a class proceeding against the Firm as they form a
    “complete code” and require individual assessments of client accounts.  The
    Firm says, even if that is not the case, the solicitor-client privilege of its
    former and current clients shields the Firm from the class proceeding intended to
    benefit those former and current clients who signed a CFA with the Firm.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Hodge cross-appeals, arguing that the Divisional Court erred by
    denying her leave to amend her <span class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of
    Application to plead the tort of conversion and failing to certify further
    common issues. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and allow the
    cross- appeal in part. While I would dismiss the appeal, I conclude the
    Divisional Court erred in certifying one issue (common issue 3) as a common
    issue and would vary the certification order by deleting that common issue. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to my analysis of the issues on the appeal and
    cross-appeal, I will provide the necessary background, including the relevant statutory
    provisions as they are key to understanding my analysis of the issues. For ease
    of reference, all relevant statutory provisions are included in the attached
    Schedule A.</p>
  <h2><span style='color:black'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Solicitors Act</i></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Historically, lawyers in Ontario were prohibited from charging their
    clients a fee based on a percentage of damages recovered by their clients.
    Eventually, the legislature recognized that CFAs can provide access to justice
    to people of limited means. The Act was amended in 2002 to authorize
    contingency fees in certain circumstances and to provide certain protections
    for clients. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 28.1 sets out the circumstances in which a lawyer is permitted
    to enter into a CFA. Central to this appeal are ss. 28.1(8) and (9), as it is
    alleged that the Firm entered into CFAs that did not comply with s. 28.1(8)
    with the result that they were unenforceable pursuant to s. 28.1(9):</p>
  <p class=CQuote>28.1(8)  A contingency fee agreement shall not include in the
    fee payable to the solicitor, in addition to the fee payable under the
    agreement, any amount arising as a result of an award of costs or costs
    obtained as part of a settlement, unless,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) the solicitor and client jointly apply to a judge of the
    Superior Court of Justice for approval to include the costs or a proportion of
    the costs in the contingency fee agreement because of exceptional
    circumstances; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) the judge is satisfied that exceptional circumstances apply
    and approves the inclusion of the costs or a proportion of them.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(9) A contingency fee agreement that is subject to approval
    under subsection (6) or (8) is not enforceable unless it is so approved. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections 23-25 of the Act are also central to this appeal, as the Firm
    argues that they form a “complete code” and thus provide the only avenue
    through which Ms. Hodge’s claims may be pursued: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>23. No action shall be brought upon any such agreement, but
    every question respecting the validity or effect of it may be examined and
    determined, and it may be enforced or set aside without action on the
    application of any person who is a party to the agreement or who is or is
    alleged to be liable to pay or who is or claims to be entitled to be paid the
    costs, fees, charges or disbursements, in respect of which the agreement is
    made, by the court, not being the Small Claims Court, in which the business or
    any part of it was done or a judge thereof, or, if the business was not done in
    any court, by the Superior Court of Justice.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>24. Upon any such application, if it appears to the court that
    the agreement is in all respects fair and reasonable between the parties, it
    may be enforced by the court by order in such manner and subject to such
    conditions as to the costs of the application as the court thinks fit, but, if
    the terms of the agreement are deemed by the court not to be fair and
    reasonable, the agreement may be declared void, and the court may order it to
    be cancelled and may direct the costs, fees, charges and disbursements incurred
    or chargeable in respect of the matters included therein to be assessed in the
    ordinary manner.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>25. Where the amount agreed under any such agreement has been
    paid by or on behalf of the client or by any person chargeable with or entitled
    to pay it, the Superior Court of Justice may, upon the application of the
    person who has paid it if it appears to the court that the special
    circumstances of the case require the agreement to be reopened, reopen it and
    order the costs, fees, charges and disbursements to be assessed, and may also
    order the whole or any part of the amount received by the solicitor to be
    repaid by him or her on such terms and conditions as to the court seems just.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 33(1) of the Act is also at issue on this appeal. While a
    solicitor may charge interest on unpaid disbursements, s. 33(1) of the Act
    provides that a solicitor may only charge interest from a date that is one
    month after the bill is delivered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can fairly be said that the language in the Act has created difficulties
    for lawyers and clients for many years: see, for e.g., Ontario Law Reform
    Commission, <em>Report on the Solicitors Act</em> (Ministry of the Attorney
    General, 1973). Courts have also struggled with the language, since much in the
    Act is not clear: see, for e.g. <em>Gilbert’s LLP v. David Dixon Inc.</em>,
    2017 ONSC 1345, [2017] O.J. No. 1037 (Div. Ct.).  The case before this court
    represents another struggle to make sense of the Act.</p>
  <h2><span style='color:black'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Facts </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Hodge was injured in a motor vehicle accident in 2002. She retained
    the Firm, which specializes in personal injury litigation. Most of its retainer
    agreements are on a contingency fee basis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Hodge signed a CFA with the Firm. It provided that the Firm’s legal
    fees would be equal to 25 per cent of the damages recovered on her behalf, plus
    partial indemnity costs (which would be no more than 40 per cent of the total
    recovery), plus disbursements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2006, Ms. Hodge’s claim for statutory accident benefits was
    settled for a total of $85,000. Greg Neinstein’s evidence was that she received
    $66,089.49 in hand from this settlement and that the Firm deferred $11,250 of
    the fees it was entitled to be paid from the settlement because Ms. Hodge was
    in financial difficulty. The remainder was to be paid out of the tort
    settlement or judgment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 2010, an “all-in” settlement of $150,000 was reached in Ms.
    Hodge’s tort action. She received $41,906.41 of that amount. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gary Neinstein determined what portion of the settlement would be
    allocated to costs. The final account rendered to Ms. Hodge indicated that she
    was charged $60,326.49 for legal fees, of which $30,000 was said to be the
    party-and-party costs portion of the settlement, and $30,326.49 was the legal
    fee plus GST, and $48,924.37 for disbursements. Among other things, the
    disbursements included: $4,008.27 for photocopies; $2,791.20 for laser copies;
    $1,280.70 for scanned documents; $1,372.33 for “Interest Recovery”; and $200.00
    for “Miscellaneous Expenses/File Closing Charges”. According to the evidence, “Interest
    Recovery” is interest, compounded monthly, on disbursements that were incurred
    by the Firm, calculated from the date that they were incurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There appears to be no dispute that the CFA and the amount the Firm
    charged violated the Act in two key respects. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most significantly, there appears to be no dispute that, contrary to s.
    28.1(8) of the Act, the Firm did not obtain approval of a judge of the Superior
    Court of Justice to include in its fee the costs obtained as part of Ms.
    Hodge’s settlement.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, seemingly contrary to s. 33(1), the Firm charged interest from
    the date the disbursements were incurred, and not from a date one month after
    its bill was delivered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Hodge brought a motion to certify a class proceeding against the Firm
    on behalf of all its contingency fee clients since October 2004. In her <span
class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of Application, she seeks, among other
    relief, a declaration that the Firm is in violation of the Act and breached its
    fiduciary duty to and its contracts with the class members, and an order that
    the Firm repay any amounts taken for costs in addition to a percentage of
    damages. She also alleges that the Firm charged disbursements that were
    excessive or improper. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the certification motion, she requested that the court certify 37
    common issues.</p>
  <h2><span style='color:black'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Decisions Below</h2>
  <h5><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The certification judge’s reasons</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The certification judge concluded that Ms. Hodge failed to satisfy the five-part
    test for certification under s. 5(1) of the CPA:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5.  (1) The court shall certify a class proceeding on a motion
    under section 2, 3 or 4 if,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a)      the pleadings or the notice of application discloses a
    cause of action;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b)      there is an identifiable class of two or more persons
    that would be represented by the representative plaintiff or defendant;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c)      the claims or defences of the class members raise
    common issues;</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In brief, the certification judge concluded that Ms. Hodge’s <span
class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of Application satisfied the “cause of
    action” requirement in s. 5(1)(a).  While he was clear that, in his view, there
    was no “free-standing strict liability civil wrong for breach of sections
    28.1(8) and 28.1(9) of the <i>Act</i>” (para. 95), he was satisfied that the <span
class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of Application disclosed a cause of
    action under s. 23 and 25 of the Act, and for breach of fiduciary duty and
    breach of contract. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the certification judge found the class definition proposed by Ms.
    Hodge overly broad, he identified an alternative class definition and concluded
    Ms. Hodge had satisfied the “identifiable class” criterion in s. 5(1)(b) of the
    CPA. That class definition, subsequently accepted by the Divisional Court and
    set out in para. 4 of its order, is reproduced in the attached Schedule B. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the certification judge concluded that the “common issues”
    requirement in s. 5(1)(c) of the CPA was not satisfied, and Ms. Hodge’s motion
    accordingly failed. In his view, none of the 37 proposed common issues
    satisfied the common issues criterion, even though he acknowledged that it
    presented a low bar.  He found that the proposed class proceeding would
    inevitably lead to individual assessments of each class member’s claim, which could
    not be done at a common issues trial. He noted even if a breach of s. 28.1
    could be said to be a free-standing strict liability civil wrong, that would
    not overcome the common issues problem.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also concluded that Ms. Hodge’s application did not satisfy the
    “preferable procedure” criterion in s. 5(1)(d). Individual applications under
    ss. 23 and 24 of the Act or by way of assessment were the preferable procedure;
    a class action was unsuitable because the class members’ claims were inherently
    individualistic; and a class proceeding would be unmanageable and inefficient. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The certification judge rejected the Firm’s argument that another reason
    a class proceeding was not the preferable procedure was that it would result in
    a breach of the solicitor-client privilege held by thousands of clients and
    former clients of the Firm.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He found that solicitor-client privilege was not an “insurmountable obstacle”
    if the proceeding were otherwise certifiable (para. 176). He indicated that if Ms.
    Hodge’s application had been certifiable, he would have made an order requiring
    proof of personal service of a notice of certification on class members making
    clear that class members who did not opt out of the class proceeding would be
    deemed to have waived their solicitor-client privilege. Along with the notice
    of certification he would have also required a special notice advising class
    members to obtain independent legal advice about the notice of certification. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the certification judge concluded that if the other
    certification criteria had been satisfied, Ms. Hodge would have been a suitable
    representative plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, he ordered Ms. Hodge to pay the Firm’s costs in the amount
    of $300,000, plus HST, plus disbursements of $28,758.45.</p>
  <h5><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Divisional Court’s reasons</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Hodge appealed the certification decision to the Divisional Court.
    She also sought leave to appeal the costs decision. At the outset of the
    appeal, she requested leave to amend her <span class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of Application to plead the tort of conversion.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court allowed her appeal. Molloy J. wrote for the
    majority with Lederer J. concurring. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues on appeal involved ss. 5.1(a) (cause of action), (c) (common
    issues) and (d) (preferable procedure) of the CPA.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Molloy J. concluded that the cause of action criterion was met. She
    agreed with the certification judge that Ms. Hodge had met the test for showing
    causes of action in breach of fiduciary duty and contract. Contrary to the certification
    judge, however, she concluded that a proceeding depending solely on s. 28.1 of
    the Act could succeed as it was arguable that ss. 23-25 of the Act do not apply
    where there is a breach of the Act that brings s. 28.1(9) into play. At para.
    95, she stated: “[A]n application under ss. 23 and 24 of the [Act] is not
    available to review the validity of the [CFAs] at issue here.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Molloy J. also determined the common issues requirement was satisfied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> She disagreed with the certification judge’s conclusion that, even if a
    breach of ss. 28.1(8) and (9) were a free-standing wrong, it would not avoid
    the need for individualized inquiries. She concluded that whether the Firm
    complied with s. 28.1(8) and whether the CFAs were unenforceable under s.
    28.1(9) were questions common to all members of the class.  She posited that a
    common remedy might flow from a declaration that such CFAs are unenforceable.
    For example, the Firm might be disentitled to retain the costs portion of the
    fee paid to it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She identified eight common issues arising out of the alleged
    violation of s. 28.1(8) of the Act. They are common issues 1-8 in Schedule C attached. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She also found that whether the Firm charged class members for interest
    contrary to s. 33 of the Act, whether doing so amounted to a breach of contract
    or fiduciary duty, and whether interest charged contrary to s. 33 should be
    disgorged or the Firm should be otherwise ordered to repay any amounts taken on
    account of interest were common issues. These common issues are set out as
    common issues 9-13 in Schedule C attached.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, she found that whether disbursements for computer legal
    research, closing fees and storage fees allegedly charged by the Firm to its
    clients as a matter of general practice were improper because they were part of
    office overhead, and whether the rates the Firm charged its clients for
    photocopying and scanning documents were excessive, were common issues. Rates
    would be common for all clients. These common issues are set out as common issues
    14-19 in Schedule C.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would note that while Molloy J. was in general disagreement
    with the certification judge on the common issues requirement, she did agree
    with him in one narrow respect. She agreed that an assessment under ss. 23-25
    of the Act would be so individualized that no meaningful common issues would
    emerge, although on her view arguably those provisions did not apply where an
    agreement was deemed to be unenforceable under s. 28.1(9).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning finally to the preferability requirement, Molloy J. concluded
    that it too was satisfied. Fundamental to her preferability analysis were her
    conclusions that (1) the certification judge erred in failing to find it was
    arguable a proceeding that relies on a breach of s. 28.1 of the Act could
    succeed and (2) there were issues that were common to the class. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She agreed with the certification judge that the solicitor-client
    privilege issue was not an obstacle to a class proceeding. She accepted that
    the procedure suggested by the certification judge was one way to avoid the
    problem although there may be others. She indicated that she would leave the
    specific manner of dealing with the problem to the case management judge. As
    there was at least one way to avoid the problem, it was not a basis for
    refusing certification.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her view, there were considerable barriers to access to justice for
    the class members and little ability for them to address them other than
    through a class proceeding. Judicial economy also favoured a class proceeding. Another
    advantage of a class proceeding was behavior modification: a class proceeding
    would serve as a reminder to all lawyers in Ontario that the requirements in
    the Act for CFAs must be followed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She dismissed Ms. Hodge’s motion to amend her <span class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of Application to plead the tort of conversion. She concluded that it
    “adds nothing of substance to the proceeding as currently drafted” and so it
    was unnecessary to consider it: at para. 112. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because she determined that Ms. Hodge had satisfied the test for
    certification, she set aside the certification judge’s costs order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In concurring reasons, Lederer J. agreed with Molloy J. as to the
    outcome. Like her, he concluded that it is not plain and obvious that a cause
    of action relying on a breach of s. 28.1 of the Act could not succeed and,
    accordingly, that it should be certified. Also like her, he agreed that
    decisions made pursuant to ss. 23 and 24 of the Act would be inherently
    individualistic. However, he made clear he did not agree with all of Molloy
    J.’s reasoning, noting at para. 118: “I do not accept that the interpretation
    by the [certification] judge of the applicable sections of the [Act] is
    necessarily wrong and Molloy J. necessarily correct. She may be.” </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Firm challenges the Divisional Court’s findings on all the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The crux of the Firm’s argument is that Ms. Hodge’s application – whether
    framed as a breach of the Act, breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty –pertains
    solely to the validity, effect and enforceability of her CFA. As such, it falls
    squarely within the complete code of the Act, which precludes any common law
    action for breach of statute and requires individual assessments of client
    accounts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I explain, the Divisional Court correctly concluded that it is not

    Lederer J. and the certification judge, I conclude that it is not plain and
    obvious that an application under ss. 23-25 of the Act is not available to
    review the CFAs at issue in this application. I also agree with the
    certification judge and the Divisional Court that Ms. Hodge’s <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In each of <em>Seneca College</em>, <em>Frame</em> and <em>Canadian
    Alliance</em>, the court reviewed the legislation in question and determined
    that it created a complete code or comprehensive scheme.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Seneca College</em>, the Supreme Court considered <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Ontario’s </span></em><em>Human Rights Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 318, </span></em>and concluded that

    invocation of any public policy expressed in the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Frame</em>, the Supreme Court similarly concluded that permitting
    a father to sue the mother and her present husband for frustrating
    court-ordered access, either by creating a tort or recognizing a fiduciary duty
    arising out of a court order, “may well do violence to the comprehensive statutory
    scheme [of the <em>Children’s Law Reform Act</em><em><u><span style='font-style:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Canadian Alliance</em>, the question was whether s. 75 of the <em>National
    Energy Board Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-7 (“NEBA”), created a civil cause of
    action. It provides: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>A company shall, in the exercise
    of the powers granted by this Act or a Special Act, do as little damage as
    possible, </span><span class=Underline>and shall make full compensation in the
    manner provided in this Act</span><span style='background:white'> and in a
    Special Act, to all persons interested, for all damage sustained by them by
    reason of the exercise of those powers. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court concluded the answer was no. Writing for the court, O’Connor
    A.C.J.O. noted, at paras. 31 and 32, that there is no nominate tort of
    statutory breach in Canada.  Relying on <em>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool,</em><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
color:black;background:white'>[1]</span></span></span></a><em> </em>he
    explained that since there is no nominate tort of statutory breach, a breach of
    statutory obligation cannot give rise to a civil cause of action unless the
    statute establishing the obligation expressly provides for a right of action. In
    the particular case, the NEBA created a complete code for the compensation of
    all persons who sustained damages from the exercise of a pipeline company’s
    statutory powers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, <em>Seneca College</em>, <em>Frame</em> and <em>Canadian
    Alliance</em> are arguably distinguishable for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, s. 28.1 is unique in one important respect: s. 28.1(9)
    specifically provides that a CFA that is subject to approval under subsection
    (8) is <span class=Underline>not enforceable</span> unless it is so approved.
    Section 28.1(9) provides <span class=Underline>a consequence</span> for the
    statutory breach. Much of the relief Ms. Hodge seeks flows from that provision -
    the statutorily-prescribed consequence of the breach - and not the breach
    itself. The claimants in <em>Seneca College</em>, <em>Frame</em> and <em>Canadian
    Alliance</em> did not seek relief based on a statutorily-provided consequence
    of a breach of statute. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as Molloy J. highlights, at para. 57, the declaration that Ms.
    Hodge seeks is in respect of rights under an <span class=Underline>agreement</span>.
    Arguably, it is different from an action based on breach of a statutory term,
    as in <em>Seneca College.</em> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a CFA that is subject to approval under subsection (8) is not
    enforceable unless it is so approved, then, arguably, is there any need for an
    application under s. 23 to determine its validity or effect? Arguably, has s.
    28.1(9) already answered that question? And is it necessary to have the
    agreement declared “void” under s. 24, when s. 28.1(9) specifically provides
    that the agreement is unenforceable? In my view, the answers to these questions
    are not plain and obvious. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I acknowledge that the Act does not <span class=Underline>expressly</span> provide that a client may pursue civil remedies where a CFA that is subject to
    approval under subsection (8) is “not enforceable unless it is so approved”. In
    my view, however, it is arguable whether express language is necessarily
    required despite comments in <em>Canadian Alliance</em> that might be read as suggesting
    otherwise. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Canadian Alliance</em>, O’Connor A.C.J.O. approached the question
    of whether s. 75 created a cause of action as a matter of statutory
    interpretation. As set out above, s. 75 provides that a company “shall make
    full compensation in the manner provided in [the NEBA]”, which this court
    agreed referred to the comprehensive scheme for dispute resolution in ss. 88 to
    103 of the NEBA. The wording of s. 75 was to be contrasted with other
    provisions in the NEBA that expressly created civil causes of action for
    landowners. It was in that context O’Connor A.C.J.O. stated that express
    language was necessary to create a cause of action based on a breach of s. 75. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have explained, s. 28.1 is unique. Not only is it unique but it
    arises in a very different statutory context than in <em>Canadian Alliance</em>.
    In contrast with the NEBA, the <em>Solicitors Act</em> does not expressly authorize
    actions but rather expressly places specific limits on when and how certain
    types of actions may be brought and, in the case of s. 23, whether an action,
    as opposed to an application, may be brought. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, s. 2(1) dictates when a solicitor may sue on an unpaid bill
    (“[n]o action shall be brought … until one month after a bill… has been
    delivered…”). Section 8 provides an exception to that rule, permitting an
    action to be brought “although one month has not expired since the delivery of
    the bill” with leave of the court. Section 6(4) imposes a leave requirement where
    a matter has been referred to assessment. And, s. 23, which is at the heart of
    this appeal, says that “[n]o action shall be brought upon any such agreement”
    but rather questions respecting the validity or effect of an agreement may be
    determined on an application. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading s. 28.1 in context of these provisions and the Act as a whole, I
    am not persuaded it is plain and obvious that the mere absence of express
    language permitting a claim based on s. 28.1 is fatal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with Molloy J. that the line of cases relied on by the
    certification judge do not support his conclusion as to the lack of viability
    of a claim based on s. 28.1 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the certification judge’s reading, decisions of this court such as <em>Henricks-Hunter
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. 814888 Ontario Inc. (c.o.b. Phoenix Concert
    Theatre)</em>, 2012 ONCA 496, 294 O.A.C. 333, make clear that ss. 23-25 of the
    Act constitute a complete code and a CFA can only be disregarded when the court
    determines, under s. 24, that the agreement is not fair and reasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Henricks-Hunter</em>, the Public Guardian and Trustee entered
    into a CFA with a law firm on behalf of Stephanie Henricks-Hunter who suffered
    serious personal injuries, including a severe traumatic brain injury, in an
    accident. The CFA provided that the firm would be paid fees of 25 per cent of
    any judgment or settlement up to $2.5 million and 20 per cent of any judgment
    or settlement in excess of that amount. Any costs recovered would be excluded
    from the CFA. In other words, there was no s. 28.1 issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge disregarded the CFA in fixing the fees payable to the
    firm. His only mention of the CFA was his statement that it did not bind either
    Ms. Henricks-Hunter or the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court concluded that the motion judge had erred in failing to
    consider whether the CFA should be enforced and by determining the amount of
    fees without regard to the CFA. The court stated that a CFA “can only be
    declared void, or be cancelled and disregarded, where the court determines that
    it is either unfair or unreasonable” (para. 13).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, as Molloy J. notes, <em>Henricks-Hunter</em> and the other cases
    referred to by the certification judge do not involve situations where a breach
    of s. 28.1(8) was said to render the agreement unenforceable under s. 28.1(9). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only case where non-compliance with s. 28.1(8) was at issue is <em>Sé</em><em>guin
    v. Van Dyke</em>, 2013 ONSC 6576.<em> </em>The certification judge concluded
    that it did not assist Ms. Hodge while Molloy J. found that <em>Sé</em><em>guin</em> favoured Ms. Hodge’s case. I agree with Molloy J. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Sé</em><em>guin</em>, the plaintiff brought an application for a
    declaration that the CFA with her counsel was unenforceable pursuant to s.
    28.1(9) of the Act and an order for the immediate repayment, with interest, of
    the 33.3 per cent contingency fee. She also applied for an assessment of the
    balance of her account under s. 28.1(11)(b), which, in the case of a CFA to
    which 28.1(8) applies, permits a client to apply for an assessment within six
    months after the delivery of the bill. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel in <em>Sé</em><em>guin</em> consented to, and Lalonde J.
    ordered, the repayment sought by the plaintiff. He declared the CFA void and
    unenforceable. He ordered that the reasonableness of the fees charged by
    counsel be determined in the tort action, which the plaintiff and other family
    members had commenced against counsel. He distinguished <em>Henricks-Hunter</em> on the basis that it was not concerned with an agreement that breaches the Act.
    He wrote, at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I also find that in deciding the issue in this
    case, s. 24 must be read in conjunction with s. 28; otherwise why would s. 28
    form part of the legislation? ...I do not believe, in a case such as the
    present one, that s. 24 dictates that the proper forum to deal with the CFA is
    before a Superior Court Judge who will assess the Defendant’s work. The breach
    here is fundamental.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take from <em>Sé</em><em>guin</em> that it is at least arguable that
    an assessment under s. 24 is not the only remedy available where a CFA is
    unenforceable pursuant to s. 28.1(9). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is arguable that this court’s inherent jurisdiction in
    matters relating to the regulation of lawyers’ accounts suggests that ss. 23-25
    of the Act may not constitute a complete code. This court has held that courts
    have remedial authority beyond the four corners of the Act, drawing on inherent
    jurisdiction, in matters relating to the regulation of lawyers’ accounts: <em>Clatney
    v. Quinn Thiele Mineault Grodzki LLP</em>, 2016 ONCA 377, 131 O.R. (3d) 511, at
    paras. 77-79. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, it is not plain and obvious that, to the extent the
    relief Ms. Hodge seeks in her application relies on non-compliance with s.
    28.1(8), ss. 23-25 of the Act are a “complete code” and her claim cannot
    succeed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would, however, note that in reaching that conclusion I do not rely on
    Molloy J.’s reasoning that an agreement that is not compliant with s. 28.1(8)
    is not a “contingency fee agreement” as defined in the Act and therefore not an
    “agreement” within the meaning of that term in ss. 23 and 24 of the Act. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead I agree with the certification judge and Lederer J. that it is
    not plain and obvious that ss. 23-25 of the Act are unavailable to review the CFAs
    at issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 16(2) of the Act defines “agreement” for the purposes of, among
    other sections, ss. 23-25 of the Act:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>“agreement” includes
    a contingency fee agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 15 defines a “contingency fee agreement” for purposes of, among
    other sections, ss. 23-25:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>“contingency fee
    agreement” means an agreement referred to in section 28.1; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And s. 28.1(1) provides that a solicitor may enter into a “contingency
    fee agreement” with a client in accordance with s. 28.1.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Molloy J.  interpreted the words “an agreement <span class=Underline>referred
    to</span> in section 28.1” in s. 15 as meaning “an agreement <span
class=Underline>in compliance with</span> s. 28.1”. In my view, she was arguably
    in error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, even if a non-compliant CFA is not a “contingency fee
    agreement” as defined in s. 15, arguably it is nonetheless an “agreement”, and
    arguably a client can avail herself of ss. 23-25 in the event of non-compliance
    with s. 28.1. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, I agree with the Divisional Court that it is not plain
    and obvious that a claim relying on s. 28.1 of the Act is barred by ss. 23 – 24
    even though I reach that conclusion by a different route. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, whether the Act permits a client to bring a claim for
    declaratory and other relief founded on non-compliance with s. 28.1 or,
    instead, requires the client to avail herself of ss. 23-25 in the event of
    non-compliance with s. 28.1, the client can ask the Superior Court of Justice
    to review the enforceability and effect of a CFA and grant a remedy.  On that
    basis alone, it is not plain and obvious that a cause of action founded on
    non-compliance with s. 28.1 cannot succeed.  The Firm’s argument that an
    application under ss. 23-25 of the Act requires individual assessments of
    client accounts relates to the common issues and preferable procedure
    requirements in ss. 5(1)(c) and (d), and not the existence of a cause of
    action.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court certified the breach of fiduciary duty claim with
    respect to the interest recovery charges. Common issue 11 asks whether, if it
    is determined that the Firm charged the class members for interest contrary to
    s. 33 of the Act, the violation amounts to a breach of the Firm’s fiduciary
    duty.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Firm submits that Ms. Hodge failed to plead the fiduciary duty, the
    alleged breach and resulting damage. And, in addition to arguing these claims
    are precluded by the complete code in ss. 23-25, the Firm argues a lawyer does
    not owe any duty to a prospective client when negotiating a retainer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree that Ms. Hodge’s claim has no reasonable prospect of
    success on these bases. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, reading the <span class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of

    claim for breach of fiduciary duty. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
style='line-height:100%;font-weight:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong>Second, I am not satisfied that it is plain and obvious
    the fiduciary claim falls within the scope of ss. 23-25. In my view, it is
    arguable that a claim that the Firm has breached its fiduciary duty is not a
    “question respecting the validity or effect” of the CFA. A fiduciary duty claim
    looks at the relationship between the parties and the alleged fiduciary’s
    conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, common issue 11 asks whether the Firm “charging” the class
    members interest contrary to s. 33 amounts to a breach of fiduciary duty. At
    the time the amounts are “charged”, a class member is no longer a prospective client. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I agree with the certification judge and the Divisional Court that
    it is not plain and obvious that Ms. Hodge’s breach of fiduciary duty claim
    cannot succeed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would, however, flag one procedural issue.  If the breach of fiduciary
    duty claim does not fall within the scope of an application under ss. 23-25 of
    the Act, there is a question as to the basis upon which the claim could be
    brought by way of application and, if there is no basis, what should be the
    consequence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 14.05 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><i>, </i>R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194, states that a proceeding may be brought by application where
    authorized by a statute or by the <em>Rules</em>. Rule 14.05(3), in turn, lists
    nine specific circumstances in which an application may be brought. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span

    originating process.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I flag

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court certified the breach of contract claim with respect to the interest
    recovery charges. Common issue 10 asks whether, if it is determined that the Firm
    charged the class members for interest contrary to s. 33 of the Act, the
    violation amounts to a breach of contract.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Firm’s
    primary argument is that the certification judge and Molloy J. erred in
    concluding, without any meaningful analysis, that Ms. Hodge’s application
    satisfies s. 5(1)(a) for breach of contract even though the pleading does not
    allege which provision(s) of the contract were breached, a particular act or
    omission by the Firm that breached any specific contractual term, or any
    damages arising from any breach. The Firm also submits that, even if properly
    pleaded, a breach of contract claim is caught by ss. 23-25.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree the
    Divisional Court erred in finding that Ms. Hodge has met the test for showing a
    cause of action in breach of contract given the deficiency in the pleading. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Brown v.
    Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2013 ONCA 18, 114 O.R. (3d) 355, this court
    held that the case management judge erred in conditionally certifying the class
    proceeding in the absence of a statement of claim that disclosed a cause of
    action. Here, the Divisional Court found that Ms. Hodge had met the test for
    showing a cause of action in breach of contract and certified common issue 10
    in the absence of a pleading that the substance of s. 33 was a term of the CFA
    and that term was breached. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, I
    would grant Ms. Hodge leave to amend her <span class=Underline>Amended</span> Notice of Application to plead breach of contract as I do not see how granting
    leave to amend at this stage of the proceeding would result in non-compensable prejudice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the
    complete code argument, I am not convinced that the proposed breach of contract
    claim would necessarily be precluded and covered by ss. 23 – 25, as it arguably
    would not deal with the “validity” of the CFA or even possibly its “effect”. I
    agree with the certification judge that while the Firm may have a strong
    argument that a contract claim would be caught by ss. 23-25, the argument is
    not so strong that it is plain and obvious. </p>

    be determined on a class-wide basis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not

    particular CFA might include a provision for the payment of party-and-party costs,
    at the end of the case the Firm might not charge the client that portion of the

    determination of this issue of law is necessary to the resolution of the claims

    Common issue 7 asks whether the Firm should be asked to disgorge all fees

    the alternative, whether the Firm should be ordered to repay to the class any

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The Firm argues that common issues 3, 7 and 8 have embedded in them
    the individual issue of what the Firm actually took in payment of its account.
    It again refers to Greg Neinstein’s evidence that while a CFA might include a
    provision for the payment of party-and-party costs, at the end of the case the
    Firm might not charge the client that portion of the compensation. It characterizes
    these as individual fact-driven inquiries not capable of extrapolation from one
    class member to another.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> Further, it argues that Molloy J. erred in law because she made no
    reference to the extensive and well-settled jurisprudence under the common
    issue requirement of the CPA.   Rather, it submits, in paras. 78-82 she strayed
    into an irrelevant merits-based analysis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, common issues 7 and 8 are proper common issues. Common
    issue 7 considers whether a particular remedy should flow from a declaration
    that a CFA is unenforceable under s. 28.1(9). It does not entail a
    determination of the fees paid by each class member.  It asks whether whatever
    fees were paid should be disgorged.  Similarly, common issue 8 considers
    whether an alternative remedy should apply to all class members whose CFAs are
    declared unenforceable under s. 28.1(9). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I would not characterize Molloy J. as having strayed into an

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>However, I agree with the Firm that common issue 3 is not a proper
    common issue.  While the record on appeal is replete with examples of final
    accounts showing party-and-party costs were payable to the firm, in addition to
    a percentage of the award or settlement, it also includes a Proposal for
    Distribution of Settlement Funds in relation to a claim for injuries arising
    out of an accident involving a lawyer’s son, together with an affidavit from
    the lawyer, who was his son’s litigation guardian. The Proposal shows the Firm
    did not take amounts arising from costs </span><span class=Underline>in
    addition</span><u> <span class=Underline>to</span></u> <span lang=EN-US>a
    percentage of the award or settlement: it accepted the party and party costs as
    its fee and waived its entitlement to a percentage of the amount recovered.  Although
    the lawyer’s affidavit makes clear that he will opt-out of the class proceeding
    on behalf of his minor son, and, therefore, his son will not be a member of the
    class, I would not discount this evidence in considering whether common issue 3
    is a proper common issue. In my view, whether the Firm actually took amounts
    arising from costs in an award or settlement contrary to the Act should be
    characterized as an individual issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>But this does not affect my conclusion that the Divisional Court was
    correct in certifying this proceeding. The remaining common issues would be
    sufficient to meet the certification criteria. If class members are entitled to
    a declaration that the Firm’s CFAs are unenforceable (common issue 5) or if the
    provision in the CFAs providing for the taking of costs, in addition to a
    percentage fee, is severable (common issue 6), and if, as a result, any amounts
    taken by the Firm for costs in addition to a percentage fee should be repaid
    (common issue 8), then arguably all that remains is for a class member is to
    establish that the Firm in fact took such costs from him or her.  That would be
    a simple matter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    there is, in my view, another basis for concluding that issues 1, 2 and 4 – 8 are
    common issues.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above,
    the certification judge and the Divisional Court shared the view that
    determinations under ss. 24-25 were inherently individualistic. Their
    conclusion flows from an interpretation of ss. 24 and 25 that may be overly
    narrow. In my view, it is not plain and obvious that a determination under s.
    24 of whether the agreements are “in all respects fair and reasonable between
    the parties” requires an individualized assessment of the relationship between
    the parties and the work performed by the Firm or that the only relief that a
    Superior Court judge can order is an individual assessment, “in the ordinary
    manner”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether an
    agreement is “fair” is assessed as of the date the parties entered into the
    agreement: <em>Henricks-Hunter</em>, at para. 13. It is not plain and obvious
    to me that a court could not determine that a CFA that does not comply with s.
    28.1(8) is not “in all respects fair”. Arguably, this would trigger the court’s
    ability to order a remedy under s. 24 without an individualized assessment of
    the reasonableness of the fee charged. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And arguably s.
    24 does not restrict a court to ordering the fees “to be assessed in the
    ordinary manner”. It provides that if the agreement is not in all respects fair
    and reasonable, the court “may” (not “shall”) direct the fees to be assessed in
    the ordinary manner. <em>Sé</em><em>guin</em>, discussed above, is an example
    of the court ordering a remedy other than an assessment in the ordinary manner. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, as I
    have indicated above, this court has held that courts have remedial authority
    beyond the four corners of the Act, drawing on inherent jurisdiction: <em>Clatney</em>,
    at paras. 77-79. Arguably, under a liberal interpretation of its remedial
    authority under s. 24 or, if insufficient, under its inherent jurisdiction, the
    court could order that any portion of the fees paid to the Firm based on costs
    be repaid.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar
    questions arise with respect to s. 25. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 25, even
    if the client has already paid the fees charged by the solicitor, the court may
    take various steps “if it appears to the court that the special circumstances
    of the case require the agreement to be reopened”.  This court has recently
    held that “special circumstances” in s. 25 should be read broadly to include
    any circumstances in which “the importance of protecting the interests of the
    client and/or public confidence in the administration of justice, demand an
    assessment”, as measured by a non-exhaustive list of factors:  <em>Clatney</em>,
    at para. 86. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is arguable
    non-compliance with the Act could amount to “special circumstances” requiring
    the reopening off all the agreements tainted by non-compliance and the court
    could conclude that any portion of the fees paid to the Firm based on costs be
    repaid. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion,
    it is not plain and obvious that decisions made under ss. 24-25 would necessarily
    be inherently individualistic, which provides another basis for common issues 1,
    2 and 4-8.   </p>

    whether the class members paid the interest charges requires an individual
    assessment. They point to Czeslaw Kupnicki, a former client. After retaining
    counsel in relation to the Firm’s account, Mr. Kupnicki negotiated a settlement
    that involved not paying the interest and certain other disbursements the Firm
    had charged him. Accordingly, the Firm argues that common issues 9 – 13 are not
    proper common issues.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I reject the Firm’s argument. Common issues 9 – 11 are carefully

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    paid interest recovery charges. Given that the class definition excludes
    clients who have settled claims with respect to their accounts and the evidence
    of Ms. Hodge and Ryszard Kolbuc, there is some basis in fact that the inquiries
    in common issues 9 –13 are proper common issues. </span></p>

    affirmative, and disgorgement – in whole or in part – is found to be an

    the case management judge. It is clear from the certification judge’s detailed

    precise procedure he posited in his reasons – possibly without detailed input

    leave to appeal to SCC ref’d, [2001] 1 S.C.R. vi. The contemplated manner of
    giving notice of certification to class members is undoubtedly more cumbersome
    and costly than usual.  But that is only one factor in the overall assessment
    of whether a class proceeding is a fair, efficient and manageable method of
    advancing the claims.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>While the certification judge did not go into this detail, if the
    Firm itself reviewed its files to compile the list of class members, utilizing
    an agreed upon procedure, the identification of the class members would not
    entail a breach of those class members’ solicitor-client privilege. Similarly,
    it may be possible to resolve the common issues without breaching class
    members’ solicitor-client privilege. For example, class members’ names and
    other identifying information could be redacted from accounts and each account
    could be identified numerically. Further disclosure might only be required at
    the individual issues stage. There may be no need to require personal service
    on each class member. </span></p>

    of the common issues in their context. The inquiry must take into account the
    importance of the common issues in relation to the claim as a whole.” And, at
    para. 76, it noted that “the critical question is whether, viewing the common

    what would be a reasonable fee in all the circumstances” and that “this might
    require individual assessments, but if so, the burden would be on the

    practice of recasting certification motions on appeal. Doing so undermines the
    way that certification motions should proceed through the courts. It deprives
    appellate courts of the expertise of the judges who have been assigned to hear

    concluded that the Divisional Court did not err in permitting the proposed
    representative plaintiff to present a revised class definition and revised
    common issues. The change in the class definition did not deprive the defendant
    of an opportunity to respond and did not cause prejudice arising from lack of
    evidence or a proper record. And the defendant was not at any disadvantage in

    Rosenberg J.A. wrote for the court: “It is impossible for the defendant to
    meaningfully respond to an application for certification without knowing the
    cause of action. The definition of the class and the common issues depend upon
    the nature of the cause of action.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The court made these statements in concluding the case management

    the context of a motion by a representative plaintiff to amend its pleading on
    appeal to add a cause of action. They are nonetheless instructive in evaluating

    is different from <em>Keatley</em>.  Rather, Ms. Hodge seeks to <span

    action on appeal. As the Divisional Court recognized, the amendment was not
    essential to the issue to be determined on appeal, namely whether the
    certification judge erred in denying certification. In <em>Keatley</em>, this
    court signaled its reluctance to consider issues on appeal of certification

    reasonable prospect of success. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I am also satisfied that there is a common legal issue – whether, as
    a matter of law, failing to disclose that a CFA signed did not include the
    prescribed language and the taking of costs contrary to the Act amount to a
    breach of fiduciary duty. In my view, there is some basis in fact for asking
    whether the taking of costs contrary to the Act constituted a breach of
    fiduciary duty by the Firm, such that this is a proper common issue. As I have
    indicated above, the record on appeal is replete with examples of final
    accounts showing party-and-party costs payable to the Firm, in addition to a
    percentage of the award or settlement, and the only evidence of the Firm <u>not</u> taking such costs is that of someone who it appears will opt out of the class
    proceeding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[202]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>That said, consistent with my reasoning on the “taking issue” above,
    I agree with the Firm that whether the Firm <u>actually</u> took amounts
    arising from costs in an award or settlement contrary to the Act should be
    characterized as an individual issue.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Punitive damages are available for breach of fiduciary duty: <em>Waxman
    v. Waxman</em> (2004), 186 O.A.C. 201 (C.A.), at para. 586.  Here, the remedy
    sought for the alleged breach is disgorgement, rather than damages. There may
    in many cases be a strong argument against awarding punitive damages where
    disgorgement is ordered. However, in my view, it is not plain and obvious that,
    in principle, punitive damages could not be awarded in addition to disgorgement
    where, in the court’s view, the fiduciary’s behaviour was malicious,
    high-handed or reprehensible and this misconduct would otherwise go unpunished. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Entitlement to punitive damages can be certified as a common issue

lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 184, at para. 34. Here, the
    alleged wrongdoing is towards the class as a group and a common class-wide
    remedy (disgorgement) is sought.  If it were found that the Firm breached its
    fiduciary duty to its clients, and disgorgement – in whole or in part – were
    ordered, it would be open to the trial judge to consider whether he or she is
    in a position to determine entitlement to and the quantum of punitive damages,
    consistent with the principles in </span><em>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2002 SCC 18, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595, or, if the Firm successfully
    advances a <em>quantum meruit</em> claim, whether this could be determined only

    breach of a statutory duty gave rise to an independent tortious action. It
    concluded that it did not and, further, did not constitute negligence <i>per se</i>.
    Rather, proof of statutory breach, causative of damages, may be evidence of
    negligence and the statutory formulation of the duty may afford a specific and
    useful standard of reasonable conduct.</p>

    to obtain court approval for taking a percentage fee plus costs as a fee under
