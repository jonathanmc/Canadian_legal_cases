  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was charged with sexual assault, sexual
    interference and invitation to sexual touching in connection with his daughter
    who was under the age of 16. A jury convicted him of sexual interference and
    invitation to sexual touching, but found him not guilty of sexual assault. He
    was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment on the count of invitation to sexual
    touching and one year imprisonment (concurrent) on the count of sexual
    interference.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals his conviction on the basis that,
    having been acquitted of sexual assault, it was inconsistent for the jury to
    convict him of sexual interference. He seeks an acquittal. The appellant also seeks
    leave to appeal his sentence for the count of invitation to sexual touching and
    seeks a reduction in sentence on that count. He submits a four-year sentence
    for invitation to sexual touching is inconsistent with the acquittal on the
    count of sexual assault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the conviction
    appeal. I would grant leave to appeal sentence but would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant is the complainant’s father. The
    appellant was not involved in the complainant’s life until she was 13 or 14. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>She testified that, on a daily basis, she was required
    to give her father “</span>ups<span lang=EN-US>”. This involved stimulating his
    penis with her hands and her nose. She also touched his testicles. She did this
    every day and testified that she had a daily quota of 40 ups. In order to meet
    the quota, she would be required to do this before and after school and before
    and after dinner. He ejaculated about half of the time. On her 16<sup>th</sup> birthday, the complainant told her father that she did not want to do the ups
    anymore. He kicked her out of the house. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant also testified about “</span>rubs<span

    pubic area and her buttocks. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>These facts were the basis for the charges of sexual
    assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching. A jury found the

    interference) is <span style='line-height:200%'>inconsistent</span> with its
    verdict of not guilty <span style='line-height:200%'>on count one</span> (sexual
    assault). On the sentence appeal, the issue is whether a sentence of four years
    for invitation to sexual touching is inconsistent with the jury’s verdict of
    not guilty on the count of sexual assault.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=DE>Positions of the Parties</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the conviction appeal, the appellant submits <span lang=EN-US>the
    fact that the jury found the appellant not guilty of sexual assault means the
    jury could not have found that the elements of sexual interference were proven
    beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the sentence appeal, the appellant
    submits the sentencing judge failed to consider the acquittal on the sexual
    assault in sentencing the appellant for invitation to sexual touching. Without
    a finding of guilt on the count of sexual assault, the appellant argues it was
    improper for the sentencing judge to consider the ups and submits a sentence of
    four years’ imprisonment is therefore unfit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown submits it is possible to reconcile the jury’s
    finding of not guilty of sexual assault and guilty of sexual interference given
    the way the jury was instructed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s position on the sentence appeal is that the four-year
    sentence for invitation to sexual touching is fit. <span lang=EN-US>The Crown
    alleges it is clear from the record that the jury understood sexual assault to
    require the appellant to have touched the complainant, and not the other way
    around. Therefore, that the jury found the appellant not guilty of sexual
    assault does not mean the jury found the ups did not happen. </span>The
    sentencing judge was therefore permitted to consider the ups when sentencing
    the appellant for invitation to sexual touching.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legal test applicable when a reviewing court is faced with an
    allegation of inconsistent jury verdicts is “whether the verdicts are
    supportable on any theory of the evidence consistent with the legal
    instructions given by the trial judge”: <em>R. v. Pittiman</em>, 2006 SCC 9,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 7. Where, as here, the accused was tried on a
    multi-count indictment, “the verdicts will be supportable if the trial judge’s
    instructions were proper legal instructions that could have led the jury to
    accept a theory of the evidence producing these verdicts”: <em>R. v. L(S)</em><em><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The jury instructions with respect to sexual assault,
    juxtaposed with the instructions on sexual interference and invitation to
    sexual touching would have led the jury to conclude that, to convict the
    appellant of sexual assault, it was the </span><span class=Underline>appellant</span> <span lang=EN-US>who applied force of a sexual nature against the complainant.
    With respect to sexual interference and sexual touching, force by the appellant
    was not required.  To demonstrate this, I first review the elements of each
    offence and then consider the trial judge’s corresponding instructions to the
    jury.   </span></p>

lang=EN-US> the distinction between the colloquial concept and the legal
    concept of force was explained. There, a jury convicted the appellant of sexual
    interference but acquitted him of sexual assault. Fraser C.J.A. noted, at para.
    10, “while lawyers and judges realize that ‘</span>force<span lang=EN-US>’ as a
    legal term of art under s. 265 includes touching, the question is whether that
    was made clear to this jury. We conclude it was not.”</span></p>

style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> <span lang=EN-US>referenced above, the
    appellant was similarly convicted of sexual interference but acquitted of
    sexual assault. The appellant submitted the verdicts were inconsistent.</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>Having reviewed similar jury instructions,
    Laskin J.A. said, at para 43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[T]hough proper, the instructions were not as
    complete as they could have been. The jury was given correct instructions on
    sexual interference juxtaposed with correct instructions on sexual assault.
    Placing the components of these two offences side by side created a contrast between
    the former’</span>s <span lang=EN-US>“</span>touch<span lang=EN-US>”
    requirement and the latter’</span>s <span lang=EN-US>“</span>force<span
lang=EN-US>” requirement. More complete instructions could have explained the
    relationship between touch and force – that force includes any touching. But
    the trial judge did not clearly tell the jury that the force component of
    sexual assault was satisfied if the appellant intentionally touched the
    complainant. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the jury instruction was legally correct, here, as in <em>L(S)</em>,
    the trial judge did not clearly explain that the force component of sexual
    assault was satisfied if the jury found the rubs happened. The verdicts are
    further explained by the fact that the trial judge instructed the jury to
    consider each charge separately: <em>L(S)</em>, at para. 42. Accordingly, I
    conclude the jury’s verdicts on the counts of sexual assault and sexual
    interference are not inconsistent.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>As outlined above, the trial judge’s instruction to the
    jury on sexual assault explained the need to find that the appellant applied
    force to the complainant in circumstances of a sexual nature. The instruction
    did not, however, explain that the elements of sexual assault could be
    satisfied if the jury believed that the ups had occurred. Instead, the trial
    judge’s instructions to the jury, reproduced in part above, would have led the
    jury to infer that to convict on sexual assault, it must be </span><span
class=Underline>the appellant</span><span lang=EN-US> who applied force to the
    complainant by touching her, not the other way around. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The jury’s impression on this issue is demonstrated by

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[R]egarding Count 1, sexual assault with

    physical or does psychological or emotional force to manipulate the victim
    qualify as force?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Clearly, the jury was considering whether the force or
    touching had to be by the appellant upon the complainant. Regrettably, the trial
    judge did not address this implied concern. Instead, he answered as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Force includes any touching, no matter the
    degree of strength of power applied. Thus if [the appellant] intentionally
    touched [the complainant] in circumstances of a sexual nature, the intentional
    application of force would be implied. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Thus, to answer your question, does
    psychological or emotional force to manipulate the victim qualify as force? The
    answer is no.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>A more accurate response would have been to explain the
    relationship between force and touching and also to explain that the touching
    by the complainant in response to the appellant’s invitation to do so constituted
    sexual assault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>This court dealt with a similar situation in </span><em>Tyler</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> <span lang=EN-US>referenced above, where
    the appellant had been convicted of invitation to sexual touching and acquitted
    of sexual assault. In concluding the verdicts were reconcilable, Pardu J.A.
    said, at paras. 10 and 12:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It is more likely that the jury did not
    understand that participation by the appellant in physical contact of a sexual
    nature between the complainant and the appellant amounted to an assault, even
    if it resulted from the complainant complying with the appellant’s invitation.
    They may not have understood that the requirement that the Crown prove that he
    “intentionally touched” the complainant with his penis included this kind of
    physical contact.  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Had the trial judge expressly told the jury
    that compliance with the invitation to sexual touching amounted to a sexual
    assault by the appellant, this would have likely enlarged the instances of
    conduct potentially forming the basis for conviction on the sexual assault
    count. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>At the conclusion of the charge, the jury would have
    been left with the instructions that: (i) sexual assault involved the appellant
    applying force to the complainant; (ii) sexual interference involved the rubs;
    and (iii) invitation to sexual touching involved the request for the ups. It is
    not inconsistent that the jury would conclude – based on these instructions –
    that the appellant did not apply force to the complainant for the ups,
    performed the rubs and requested the ups.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The judge’s charge to the jury on count one (sexual
    assault) created the impression that the appellant had to exert force on the
    complainant, and it was he who had to have touched her. This impression was
    further entrenched by the contrast in the particulars of the indictment and the
    jury instructions on counts three (sexual interference) and four (invitation to
    sexual touching). Consequently, the acquittal on count one is not inconsistent
    with the convictions on counts three and four. </span></p>

    that the jury was not satisfied that the ups took place. Following my reasoning
    set out above, I do not agree.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On sentencing, a judge is “bound by the express and implied factual

    Where the factual basis of a jury verdict is unclear, however, the sentencing
    judge is entitled to make his or her own determination of the facts, so long as
    that view is consistent with the jury’s verdict: <em>Brown</em>; and<em> R. v.
    Roncaioli</em>, 2011 ONCA 378, 278 C.C.C. 117. A sentencing judge “must not
