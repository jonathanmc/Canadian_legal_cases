  <p class=Judge><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Eileen Vera Childs (“Mrs. Childs”) is 90 years
    of age and has Alzheimer’s disease.  These two appeals are the culmination of
    protracted litigation by her four children, who disagree about her care.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mrs. Childs was born on September 15, 1926.  She
    is currently 90 years of age and has Alzheimer’s disease.  She has four
    children:  Peter Childs, Caroline Childs, Michael Childs, and Andrew Childs. 
    For ease of reference, we will refer to each of the children by his or her first
    name.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The four children do not agree on how their mother
    should be cared for.  Generally speaking, Peter and Caroline are on one side of
    the dispute and Michael and Andrew are on the other side.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Applications </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two proceedings were commenced in the court
    below (the “Applications”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Michael and Andrew brought an application in
    which they sought, among other things: a declaration of Mrs. Childs’
    incapacity; a revocation of existing powers of attorney in favour of all four
    children; and, their appointment as guardians of their mother’s personal care
    and property.  The named respondents were Peter, Caroline, and the Public
    Guardian and Trustee (the “PGT”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Peter and Caroline responded with an application
    in which they sought to have Peter appointed as guardian of Mrs. Childs’
    property and Caroline as her guardian for personal care.  In addition, they
    sought the appointment of counsel for their mother under s. 3 of the </span><em>Substitute
    Decisions Act</em><i><span lang=EN-US>, 1992, </span></i><span lang=EN-US>S.O.
    1992, c. 30 (the “SDA”).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An order was made requiring the PGT to arrange
    for legal representation for Mrs. Childs under s. 3 of the SDA.  Pursuant to
    that order, Ms. Wendy Griesdorf was appointed as s. 3 counsel to represent Mrs.
    Childs (“Section 3 Counsel”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Applications were heard together on June 18, 2015.  Prior to the
    oral hearing of the Applications, almost all of the issues had been resolved on
    consent.  The only outstanding matter in dispute (aside from costs of the
    litigation) was how much Caroline should be paid for her care of Mrs. Childs. 
    There were two aspects to this matter: should Caroline be compensated for the
    care she had provided to her mother from June 2011 to October 2013 and from
    April 23, 2015 to the date of the hearing; and, how much should Caroline be
    paid on an ongoing basis for providing that care?  At the hearing, Caroline
    sought $133,000 for the care that she had provided from June 2011 to October
    2013 and $170.22 per day for the care that she had provided from April 23, 2015
    to the date of the hearing. She also sought $53,620 in annual compensation for
    caring for her mother going forward.</p>

  <p class=Heading>A Motion to Vary Is Brought</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five
    days after the Applications Decision was released, in a letter dated June 30,
    2015 (the “June 2015 Letter”), Caroline’s counsel advised the parties that
    Caroline was in the process of arranging for professional care for Mrs. Childs
    on a full-time basis.  In the June 2015 Letter, Caroline’s counsel asserted
    that full-time professional care was being arranged in accordance with the
    terms of the Applications Decision, with Caroline as the supervisor of the
    personal care plan, rather than as the primary caregiver.  The June 2015 Letter
    also stated that given the low amount of compensation provided for Caroline in
    the Applications Decision, Caroline would seek outside full-time employment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3 Counsel brought a motion under r. 59.06(2)(a) of the <em>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, seeking an order to set aside or vary
    Caroline’s appointment as guardian of Mrs. Childs’ personal care on the ground
    of new facts arising after the Applications Decision, namely, the June 2015
    Letter.  In the motion, she asserted that Caroline’s proposal in the June 2015
    Letter was inconsistent with the guardianship plan previously filed. In
    particular, Section 3 Counsel noted that Caroline was now maintaining that she would
    no longer provide such basic necessities for her mother as housekeeping,
    laundry, meal preparation or general property maintenance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 21, 2015, the applications judge gave an oral ruling (the “Vary Motion
    Ruling”) that the contents of the June 2015 Letter fell within r. 59.06(2)(a) as
    demonstrating facts arising or discovered after the Applications Decision was
    released and, consequently, the vary motion could proceed.   </p>
  <p class=Heading>Costs of the Applications</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the return of the vary motion, in reasons dated September 17, 2015, the
    applications judge released his costs decision in respect of the Applications. The
    corresponding order was dated September 18, 2015 (the “Costs Order”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3 Counsel had sought costs of the Applications of $55,351. Michael and Andrew
    consented to this amount being paid from Mrs. Childs’ assets. Caroline and
    Peter asserted that the costs were excessive and should be reduced by 75%. 
    They also alleged misconduct by Section 3 Counsel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    sets of children also sought their own costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applications judge noted that all of the issues had been resolved before the
    hearing of the Applications with the exception of Caroline’s compensation for
    her care of Mrs. Childs and that it was Peter and Caroline’s decision to
    litigate that issue.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    ordered Peter and Caroline to pay Section 3 Counsel $16,770 in costs, with the
    balance of Section 3 Counsel’s costs to be paid from Mrs. Childs’ assets.  He
    also ordered them to pay Michael and Andrew costs of $4522.  Michael and Andrew
    were to bear the balance of their costs personally.  Costs of the PGT were to
    be paid from Mrs. Childs’ estate.  Peter and Caroline were to bear their own
    costs.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Vary Motion is Heard and Decided </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    vary motion was heard over four days in October and November 2015. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 13, 2015, the applications judge delivered reasons in which he ruled
    inadmissible certain evidence that Peter and Caroline had adduced on the vary
    motion, including affidavit evidence about the conduct of Section 3 Counsel as
    well as paragraphs from Caroline and Peter’s affidavits relating to settlement
    discussions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    released reasons for judgment on the vary motion dated December 16, 2015 (the
    “Vary Motion Decision”).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the Vary Motion Decision, the applications judge rejected Caroline and Peter’s
    assertion that the June 2015 Letter was simply their attempt to implement the
    Applications Decision.  He found that Caroline and Peter’s actions had caused
    the litigation to escalate. He varied the Applications Decision by ordering that
    Michael and Caroline were to be joint guardians of Mrs. Childs’ personal care
    in accordance with a guardianship plan filed by Michael. He reluctantly
    increased Caroline’s compensation going forward to $50,000 per year, after
    Michael agreed to it and Section 3 Counsel acknowledged that it was required,
    given the situation.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span

    court.  Although there was no clear evidence that Peter and Caroline had formed
    an intention to appeal the Vary Motion Ruling within the appeal period,
    Caroline had raised issues concerning its propriety in her notice of appeal of
    the Judgment, thereby notifying the other parties within the relevant time

    disregard the request for that reason would be overly technical and contrary to
    r. 1.04 of the </span><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'> “to secure the just, most expeditious and

    should be set aside on appeal only if the first instance judge made an error in
    principle or if the costs award is plainly wrong: </span><em>Hamilton v. Open

    essentially challenges to the factual findings of the applications judge.  Such
    findings are subject to the “palpable and overriding error” standard of review.
    A “palpable” error is “one that is obvious, plain to hear or see”. An
    “overriding” error is an error that is sufficiently significant to vitiate the
    challenged finding of fact. Where the challenged finding of fact is based on a
    constellation of findings, the conclusion that one or more of those findings is
    founded on a “palpable” error does not automatically mean that the error is
    also “overriding”: </span><em>Waxman v. Waxman</em><span lang=EN-US> (2004),

    four claims that are advanced on the appeals arguably also raise questions of mixed

    standard of review.  These issues are: (1) BMO’s appointment as guardian of
    Mrs. Childs’ property; (2) Caroline’s claim for increased compensation for past
    personal care services that she provided her mother; (3) whether the

    throughout the proceedings, that she would continue to live with and care for
    her mother in her mother’s home on a full-time basis, whether or not her claims
    for compensation for such care were granted by the court.  The applications

    Caroline’s intentions, as revealed in the June 2015 Letter, stood in direct contrast

    provide personal, unpaid care to her mother.  The following excerpts from the
    Applications Decision demonstrate this.  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[32] </span><span style='font-size:7.0pt;

style='color:black;background:white'>In considering this issue, important
    factors include that the care and services performed by Caroline did benefit
    her mother and were in her mother's best interests. She did not act with the
    expectation of being compensated nor was she motivated by the compensation
    possibility. &nbsp;She would have done the same, compensation or not. Eileen
    Childs is lucky to have her daughter to help her remain in her own home because
    otherwise she could not. &nbsp;Eileen Childs has significant liquid assets.
    &nbsp;However, her in-home care needs will increase and become significant and
    the cost of the proper facility will be significant. &nbsp;These expenses are
    in her future in all likelihood.&nbsp; I have also considered that Peter and
    Michael both thought compensation was appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[38] The care provided by Caroline to this point in time is of
    priceless value to her mother. One really cannot place a dollar figure on it.
    Even if it enhanced Eileen Childs’ life for one day or one hour, the value is
    beyond measure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[42] It is fair and reasonable from the perspective of Eileen
    Childs’ best interests that Caroline be paid the sum of $25,000 in recognition
    of her efforts, which to some extent two of the three brothers have
    acknowledged. This is for her personal care services for the 2½ years between
    2011 and 2013 and for the past two months since the order of Justice McLean.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[43] This is in Eileen’s best interests to end this dispute
    between her children. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[44] <span style='color:black;background:white'>Caroline should
    not have brought this claim to court to litigate against her family, but she
    should not have had to do so either. The $150,000 incurred by this family for
    legal fees could have been more constructively utilized within the family. The
    litigation also took a toll on all concerned emotionally. We have heard
    submissions that Eileen is upset by this family feud.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='background:white'>Given the application judge’s reliance on Caroline’s representation
    that she would continue to provide her mother with personal care – with or
    without payment – the statement in the June 2015 Letter that Caroline planned
    to pursue full-time employment outside of the home met the requirements of r.
    59.06(2)(a).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='background:white'>Caroline and Peter focus on paragraph 46 of the
    Applications Decision for an interpretation that would allow Caroline to cease
    providing much personal care for Mrs. Childs.  On their interpretation, the
    Applications Decision made Caroline the guardian of Mrs. Childs’ personal care
    and ordered that others were to actually provide Mrs. Childs with most of her personal
    care.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='background:white'>Paragraph 46 must be read in the context of paragraph

    are set out now.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>[45] With respect to the
    compensation for Caroline as guardian of the personal care of Eileen Childs,
    that is a distinct issue from the direct caregiving that has taken place to
    date.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[46] Going forward as guardian of her mother’s personal care,
    Caroline’s role is as the manager of personal care rather than the primary care
    attendant. There are sufficient assets available to permit proper homecare to
    be provided for Eileen Childs in her home. Caroline will have to manage
    accessing the proper services and care givers and she should do so to provide
    fully for the best interests of her mother.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Caroline
    and Peter’s interpretation might be plausible if paragraph 46 were read in isolation. 
    However, when the Applications Decision is read as a whole, it is clear that the
    applications judge meant that the compensation that Caroline was to receive going
    forward was for the services she provided as the guardian of her mother’s
    personal care, but while Caroline continued to live in her mother’s home she
    was to provide personal care for her mother without compensation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Peter
    and Caroline’s allegation of judicial bias rests on the applications judge
    having: (1) given an early indication of his view on the vary motion before
    formally deciding that r. 59.06(2)(a) applied; (2) made an evidentiary ruling
    to exclude some allegations by Caroline and Peter against Section 3 Counsel
    from consideration on the vary motion; (3) rejected Peter and Caroline’s assertion
    that they had not properly consented to BMO’s appointment as guardian for
    property; (4) been “gratuitously critical” of their submissions and overly
    deferential toward Section 3 Counsel; and (5) allegedly met in private with
    Section 3 Counsel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a strong presumption of judicial integrity. A party who alleges a reasonable
    apprehension of judicial bias must provide the court with “cogent evidence” that
    an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically and
    “having thought the matter through” would conclude that the judge’s impugned
    conduct would cause a reasonable apprehension of bias: <em>R. v. R.D.S.</em>,
    [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at paras. 111-117. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Caroline
    and Peter have not provided such cogent evidence to this court.  In our view,
    their submissions on this ground of appeal, considered alone and in
    combination, do not rise to the requisite level.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the first allegation, we observe that a judge is entitled to offer a
    tentative view on a matter such as the one in question.  It is clear from his
    Vary Motion Ruling that the applications judge kept an open mind and decided
    jurisdiction based on the relevant legal principles and the evidence before
    him, which included the evidence led on the Applications.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applications judge was entitled to exclude some of the allegations made by
    Caroline and Peter against Section 3 Counsel from consideration on the vary motion. 
    Therefore, there is nothing in the second allegation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have already considered and rejected the submission relating to BMO’s
    appointment as Mrs. Childs’ guardian of property.  As Peter and Caroline
    consented to BMO’s appointment, there is nothing in their submission that the
    applications judge’s refusal to accept their arguments in that regard
    demonstrates a reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fourth allegation does not hold up to scrutiny. Given the about-face between Caroline’s
    position on the Applications and that expressed in the June 2015 Letter five
    days after the Applications Decision’s release, as well as the applications
    judge’s findings in the various costs decisions, the applications judge’s
    criticisms of Caroline and Peter appear well-founded.  They do not displace the
    presumption of judicial integrity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    flatly reject the fifth allegation – that there was a secret meeting between
    the applications judge and Section 3 Counsel – because, while Peter and
    Caroline make the accusation, they have provided no evidentiary support for
    it.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span

    Michael’s appointment as litigation guardian and his appointment (jointly with
    Caroline) as guardian for personal care; (b) complain about Section 3 Counsel’s
    conduct and the applications judge’s “deferential attitude” towards her; and (c)
    seek to set aside the costs orders insofar as those orders require Peter and
    Caroline to personally pay certain of the costs awards.  Each of these grounds

    allegation that Section 3 Counsel neglected to investigate Caroline’s suspicion
    that Andrew had abused Mrs. Childs cannot stand.  The record shows that Section
    3 Counsel explained to the applications judge that none of the other
    professionals who had met with Mrs. Childs privately had heard of such allegations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegation of an improper relationship between Section 3 Counsel and BMO
    reflects another attempt by Caroline and Peter to circumvent an order to which
    they consented. The record demonstrates that Section 3 Counsel initially proposed
    that Michael engage BMO as guardian of property, but that Peter and Caroline
    asked Section 3 Counsel to undertake that task instead. Furthermore, as Section
    3 Counsel points out, she had no personal or banking relationship with BMO. She
    engaged BMO on the parties’ consent and in compliance with Mrs. Childs’
    expressed preference that a bank manage her money.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is absolutely no merit to the allegation that Section 3 Counsel prolonged the
    litigation in service of her own pecuniary interest. Section 3 Counsel
    demonstrated her commitment to protecting Mrs. Childs’ interests at all steps
    of the proceedings including by initiating settlement discussions, negotiating
    consent orders wherever possible, and attempting to resolve concerns raised by the
    June 2015 Letter without recourse to the courts.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><i>c. The Costs Orders</i></b></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It will be recalled that as a
    result of the Simmons Decision, upheld on the review motion, Caroline and Peter
    may not challenge the quantum awarded in the various costs orders below.  Thus,
    this ground of appeal relates solely to whether the applications judge erred in
    ordering Peter and Caroline to personally pay certain of the costs.    </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This ground of appeal rests on
    Peter and Caroline’s contention that they were substantially successful in the
    proceedings below because they succeeded in having Mrs. Childs remain in her
    own home, as she wished, rather than be moved into an elder care facility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Even if Peter and Caroline’s view of
    what occurred in these proceedings is correct, it does not amount to a reason
    to interfere with the costs decisions below.  In the Applications Decision, the
    applications judge made findings of fact that fully warrant costs being ordered
    against Peter and Caroline personally.  It will be recalled that he found that
    all issues – other than costs – had been resolved prior to the oral hearing of
    the Applications with the exception of Caroline’s compensation and that Caroline
    and Peter were the ones who had caused litigation of that issue.  When deciding
    costs of the vary motion, the applications judge found that it was Caroline and
    Peter’s actions that had caused the motion to be brought and that they had
    “leveraged their mother’s health and best interests” to manipulate a more
    favourable financial result for Caroline than he had ordered in the
    Applications Decision.  </span></p>

    a high degree of deference to first instance costs awards: </span><em>Open

    circumstances of this case, we see no error in principle in the applications
    judge’s decision to require Peter and Caroline to pay certain costs personally
    nor are the orders plainly wrong.  </span></p>
