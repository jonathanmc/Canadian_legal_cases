    L. Lack of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on November 18,
    2011.</p>
  <p><strong>By the Court:</strong></p>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The four appellants and others were tried by a jury on a 31-count
    indictment.  The indictment included 14 counts of fraud over $5,000 and 14
    corresponding conspiracy charges.  Each appellant was charged with some, but
    not all, of the <span lang=EN-US>fraud/conspiracy allegations.  In addition,
    all of the appellants were charged with, and convicted of, a single count of
    knowingly contributing to an activity of a criminal organization by
    facilitating the making of fraudulent loans (count 1).  The appellants were not
    charged in two of the fraud counts in the indictment (counts 2 and 25).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants convictions and acquittals on the various fraud/conspiracy
    charges can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><strong>The
    appellant Jack</strong></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Convicted <span lang=EN-US>on 10 charges (5 fraud and 5 related conspiracy charges); and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-US>Acquitted on 2 charges (1 fraud and related conspiracy charge).</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><b>The
    appellant Spruyt</b></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Convicted

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No
    acquittals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appealed their convictions.  The appellant, Mr. Jack,
    also appealed his sentence, however, counsel abandoned that appeal at the
    outset of his oral argument.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After oral argument, the court advised counsel that the appeals would be
    dismissed with reasons to follow.  These are our reasons.</p>
  <h1>The Scheme</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fraud and <span lang=EN-US>related conspiracy charges involved what
    was referred to as an advance fee scheme.  Telemarketers, working from
    various boiler room<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> locations in the Toronto area, spoke with American residents who had responded
    to advertisements.  The telemarketers told the callers that they could borrow
    money on a short-term basis from various private lenders.  The companies
    represented as lenders did not exist and no loans were ever advanced.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The victims, who had poor credit ratings, were told by
    the telemarketers that certain advanced payments had to be made before the
    victims could receive the loans.  Some victims made a single advanced payment
    and some made more than one payment.  The amounts of these payments varied.  The
    victims never received any loans.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown alleged that the appellants worked the
    phones in one or more of the boiler rooms.  They called the potential
    victims, and working from prepared scripts, made the relevant misrepresentations. 
    If they were successful in convincing the victim to make the payments, they
    made arrangements for those payments.  The victims lost over $1 million in the
    course of the scheme. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The police investigation began in February 2008, when
    the police searched a residence after the fire department had responded to a
    flooded house call.  The search revealed many documents apparently connected to
    an ongoing telemarketing advance fee scheme.  The investigation continued to July
    24, 2008, when the police conducted simultaneous raids at several boiler rooms
    in the Toronto area.  They found many documents connected to the fraudulent scheme
    in those locations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The investigation revealed that numerous fictitious companies were used
    as the supposed lenders in the scheme.  The <span lang=EN-US>28
    fraud/conspiracy charges involving one or more of the appellants related to 14
    of those companies.  A single charge of fraud over $5,000 and conspiracy to
    commit fraud was laid in relation to each. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the end of the trial, it was common ground that the fraudulent scheme
    alleged by the Crown existed and that many people had been victimized.  The
    appellants claimed that they were not involved in the fraudulent scheme in any
    way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The Crowns case rested on surveillance evidence in
    respect of two of the appellants, and fingerprint evidence placing the
    appellants fingerprints on various documents directly related to the
    fraudulent scheme.  Those documents were found in different boiler rooms. 
    Ms. Romain was arrested in one of the boiler rooms.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants who were said to have been identified in
    the surveillance evidence, argued that the identification evidence was
    unreliable.  All of the appellants argued that although their fingerprints were
    found on the documents as claimed by the Crown, those fingerprints in and of
    themselves could not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellants
    were involved in the fraudulent scheme.  Ms. Romain testified.  The other
    appellants did not.  Ms. Romain explained that she happened to be in one of the
    boiler rooms when the police arrived, having gone there earlier to purchase marihuana. 
    She smoked the marihuana in the basement and was upstairs making a call on her
    cell phone when the police arrived.  She was unaware of the fraudulent activity
    going on around her in the boiler room.</span></p>
  <h1>The Appellant mr. Osbournes Appeal</h1>
  <h3>Was the appellant, Mr. Osbourne, denied his right
    to counsel of choice?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Osbourne was represented by Ms. Abraham throughout
    the proceedings before trial.  Very shortly before the trial was to commence, Ms.
    Abraham told Mr. Osbourne that she could no longer act for him as she had taken
    a contract position with the Crown Attorneys office.  On the first day of
    trial, with jury selection about to begin, the trial judge was told that Ms.
    Abraham was withdrawing as Mr. Osbournes counsel because of the supposed
    conflict of interest.  The trial judge was told that Ms. Abraham had made
    alternate arrangements for Mr. Osbournes representation.  Ms. Abraham was not
    present.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was concerned that Mr. Osbourne be
    properly represented, that the trial proceed as scheduled, and that the very
    large jury panel assembled for jury selection not be inconvenienced any more
    than was necessary.  She ordered Ms. Abraham to appear and briefly adjourned
    the proceeding.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Discussions occurred over the next day or so.  We need
    not detail those discussions.  The arrangements for Mr. Osbournes
    representation seemed to be in a state of flux.  The trial judge made it clear that
    she would require Ms. Abraham to continue to represent Mr. Osbourne if he so
    wished.  Mr. Osbourne initially indicated he wanted Ms. Abraham to continue as
    counsel, but in a subsequent dialogue with the trial judge, he indicated that he
    was no longer content to have her as counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the following exchange occurred.  As it is central to this
    ground of appeal, we set it out in full:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>MS. ABRAHAM:  I apologize for keeping the court waiting.  Mr.
    Osbourne, perhaps he should come forward.  I have made</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>MS. ABRAHAM: arrangements for somebody that I know Mr.
    Osbourne wanted as counsel and that counsel, Mr. Hy Rosenberg.  Mr. Rosenberg
    is willing and able to appear here tomorrow and for his trial.  Now Mr.
    Osbourne, I believe Your Honour would like to hear directly from him how he
    feels about that.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT:  Yes, Mr. Osbourne, do you  is that satisfactory
    with you.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>MR. OSBOURNE:  Yes because Im familiar with this lawyer.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT:  I just want to make this perfectly clear to you. 
    Im prepared to make an order today.  Well I dont have to make an order
    today.  The fact is that Ms. Abraham is on the record and Im just prepared to
    say to her I understand you have difficulties, but youre on the record and you
    must see this trial through, okay.  So thats an option for you Mr. Osbourne. 
    You can carry on with  in this trial with Ms. Abraham as your lawyer. 
    Alternatively, if that doesnt suit you, you can say, well in light of the
    circumstances here I want an opportunity to get another lawyer and I want an
    adjournment and so I would then, in all likelihood, grant you that adjournment
    to do that, or thirdly, if you  if what is being suggested here that Mr.  is
    it Rosenberg.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>MS. ABRAHAM:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT:  Mr. Rosenberg represent you and come tomorrow and
    hes able to do that, thats fine too.  So those are your options.  Do you need
    some time to think about it?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>MR. OSBOURNE:  Im okay with Mr. Rosenberg.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT:  Okay, youre completely satisfied.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>MR. OSBOURNE:  Yes.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT:  All right, thats good enough for me then.  Okay,
    thats fine, thank you sir.  You can sit down.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge put Mr. Osbournes options to
    him fairly and fully.  Mr. Osbourne made a clear and unequivocal decision to
    proceed with Mr. Rosenberg as his counsel.  There is no suggestion that Mr. Osbourne
    was acting under any disability or did not fully understand the situation or
    the options available to him.  The trial judge did not pressure Mr. Osbourne to
    make a choice.  She expressly told him that he did not have to make a decision
    then and there, but could have some time to think about it.  Mr. Osbourne
    declined that invitation.  Nor does it advance the appellants argument to
    point to things the trial judge could have done, but did not do.  It is almost
    inevitable when a trial judge is faced with a situation like this that one can
    think of something the trial judge could have done that he or she did not do. 
    That is not the standard of review.  The issue is whether the trial judge did

    had his counsel of choice.  In his affidavit, filed in this court five years
    after his conviction, and on the eve of the appeal, Mr. Osbourne declares that
    he did not have counsel of choice.  However, to the extent that the affidavit
    sheds any light on the matter, it demonstrates that Mr. Osbourne was fully aware
    of his options at trial, appreciated the pros and cons of each, and made a
    choice to proceed with Mr. Rosenberg.  The choice was a fully informed one,
    although no doubt, like many choices people make, somewhat dictated by the

    taken as rejecting the Crowns argument that the court should not receive the

    of justice would not be served by receiving the appellants affidavit on the
    eve of the appeal, when no explanation is offered for the total failure to
    comply with the rules and conventions of this court governing fresh evidence
    applications in criminal appeals.  The negative impact on the proper
    administration of justice flowing from receiving an affidavit at this stage of
    the proceeding is properly considered in determining what the interests of
    justice require in a given case.  The timing of the filing of the appellants
    affidavit, had there been any merit to this argument, may well have forced the court
    to bifurcate the appeal and further delay the resolution of what is already a
    five-year old appeal.  We would think the court would be reluctant to go down
    that path without some good explanation for the late filing of the material and
    some demonstration of real potential merit in the fresh evidence application.</span></p>

    Crown position in respect of Ms. Romains cell phone at least 18 months before

    make any kind of production order, unless and until it was clear that one of
    the 13 seized cell phones belonged to Ms. Romain.  The easiest and most obvious
    way to achieve that end was to have counsel and Ms. Romain examine the cell

    counsel suggested that Ms. Romain indicated to the officer that she was not

    Counsel for Ms. Romain was content with the trial judges language probably
    because it assisted in his attack on the credibility of the police.  On the trial
    judges version of the police officers evidence, counsel could argue that it
    was simply incredible for the police to suggest that they had not seized Ms.
    Romains phone, given the circumstances in which she was arrested.  Counsel
    could argue that the police were lying about not seizing the phone because they

    submits that the Crown artificially and deceptively charged a number of
    frauds over $5,000 by grouping the charges according to the identity of the fictitious
    lender, an irrelevant factor, and identifying the victim, not as the individual
    borrowers, but as the public.  Counsel submits that all of this deception was

    scheme that has always been charged as a fraud on the public.  The scheme
    targeted a segment of the public at large, as opposed to specific individuals
    identified as targets before the scheme was implemented. The schemes goal was
    to cheat anyone who answered the ads and called the boiler rooms.  There is
    nothing deceptive or prejudicial in describing the victims of this fraud as the

    charges in other ways.  The approach taken by the Crown, however, potentially made
    the case more manageable for the jury.  We see no basis upon which it could be
    said that, by laying a separate charge in respect of each fictitious company, the
    Crown somehow put Mr. Jack in a worse position than he would have been had the

    individual victims were defrauded of less than $5,000.  This argument assumes
    there was some merit to the submission that the fraud was mis-described as a
    fraud on the public.  There was not.  As we are satisfied that Mr. Jack was
    properly charged with frauds over $5,000 and conspiracies to commit fraud over

    for Mr. Jack, the trial judge admitted a document setting out the outcome of
    the charges against other persons referred to in the evidence.  Five of those
    individuals had pled guilty to fraud or conspiracy to commit fraud and the
    charges had been withdrawn against two. </span></p>

    worked to produce the Agreed Statement of Facts.  Obviously, counsel did not
    want the jury wondering about what might have happened to some of the other
    named conspirators.  Each counsel no doubt had specific tactical reasons for
    the admissions.  There is no suggestion that Mr. Jack did not receive effective
    and competent legal assistance. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>The trial judge cautioned the jury against using the convictions of
    others in determining the guilt of individual appellants.  She gave that
    caution both when the Agreed Statement of Facts was admitted and during her
    charge.  In her charge, she added the caution, a person who pleads guilty may
    have had any number of reasons for pleading guilty.   The trial judges
    instructions adequately cautioned the jury against any misuse of the
    information provided in the Agreed Statement of Facts. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>We do not see how we can hold that the trial judge erred in
    admitting into evidence an Agreed Statement of Facts, absent some suggestion
    that by agreeing to those facts counsel did not provide competent
    representation.  For this court to go behind the Agreed Statement of Facts and
    counsels tactical decisions, absent a claim of ineffective assistance, would
    be to severely undermine counsels independence and the overall credibility of
    the trial process.  </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The instruction on potential
    liability under section 21(2)</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge instructed the jury on the operation of s. 21(2) of
    the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>.  She told the jury that if
    an accused had agreed with another or others to commit a fraud under $5,000,
    and one or more of the people in the agreement committed a fraud over $5,000 in
    the course of carrying out the agreement, the accused would be guilty of fraud
    over $5,000 if that accused knew or should have known that one of the other
    parties to the agreement would commit fraud over $5,000 in the course of pursuing
    the common objective.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>There was no objection to the charge.  The instruction assumes that
    fraud over $5,000 and fraud under $5,000 are discrete offences.  The language
    of s. 380 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US> and this
    courts judgment in </span><em>R. v. Bernard</em><span lang=EN-US>, [2013] ONCA
    371 suggest otherwise.  The language used in s. 380 suggests there is one crime
     fraud.  The amount of the fraud is relevant to jurisdiction (the amount
    alleged in the charge) and penalty (the amount proved by the Crown).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We need not decide whether fraud over $5,000 and fraud under $5,000
    are two distinct crimes.  On the evidence, there was no realistic basis upon
    which a jury could conclude that Mr. Jack had entered into an agreement to
    defraud the public, but only of an amount less than $5,000.  The fraudulent
    scheme alleged and proved by the Crown was to defraud any member of the public
    who could be induced through various misrepresentations to pay one or more advance
    fees.  The amount of the fraud contemplated by the agreement was the total amount
    the fraudsters could eventually induce members of the public to advance to them.  </span></p>

  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The trial judges review of the
    evidence against Mr. Jack</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Counsel for Mr. Jack accepts that the fingerprint evidence
    incriminating Mr. Jack could reasonably justify his conviction on the counts on
    which he was found guilty.  Counsel also accepts that the trial judge
    accurately reviewed the fingerprint evidence.  Counsel contends, however, that
    the trial judge erred in leaving other evidence with the jury as potentially
    confirmatory of the Crowns case against Mr. Jack.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge left three pieces of evidence with the jury as
    relevant to their determination of whether the Crown had proved Mr. Jacks
    guilt.  First, the trial judge referred to the evidence that Mr. Jack was seen
    at the Whites Road boiler room on the day the search was executed.  Second,
    she referred to the name Jack which appeared on a document relating to the
    fraud.  Mr. Jacks fingerprints were found on other documents relating to the
    same fictitious lender.  Third, the trial judge referred to the evidence that
    Mr. Jack listed his address on his drivers licence as the same address as Tawnya
    Neil, one of the alleged co-conspirators.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>There was no objection to the trial judges treatment of the
    evidence.  In her charge, she had given a detailed summary of the purported identification
    evidence.  That summary no doubt brought home to the jury the weakness of the
    supposed identification evidence.  It amounted to little more than evidence
    that someone looked like Mr. Jack.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The other evidence, the name Jack on the document and the residence
    shown on his drivers licence, had relatively little probative value, although
    the nickname was connected in the evidence to documentation relating to a
    victim named Marianne Shipley.  Mr. Jacks fingerprints were also found on a
    document relating to that same victim.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We are not convinced that the trial judge should have withdrawn the
    impugned evidence from the jury, especially in the absence of any request that she
    do so.  The Crown made only brief reference to the evidence in its
    submissions.  The trial judges instructions to the jury also made little reference
    to this evidence.  The case for the Crown and the case for the defence were put
    to the jury, as they should have been, largely on the basis of the fingerprints
    and the inferences, if any, the jury should draw from those fingerprints.  The
    trial judges brief reference to other bits of evidence relevant to the case
    against Mr. Jack gave that evidence the minor role it deserved.  </span></p>
