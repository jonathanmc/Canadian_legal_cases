    respondent, Rita Vanier<b>,</b> and her husband, Frank Vanier, built a
    successful business - the respondent 92780 Canada Ltd.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></a></span> Frank died in 2011, leaving his entire estate to Rita. The combination of
    Rita’s advancing years (she is now 90 years of age) and some unfortunate family
    dynamics, has given rise to a struggle among Rita’s twin sons, Jean-Pierre
    (“Pierre”) and Jean-Raymond (“Raymond”) and her daughter, Patricia, over who
    should have power of attorney over Rita’s property. This struggle has had a
    devastating impact on the family’s finances and, more significantly, on their
    relationships. This appeal arises out of one aspect of that struggle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In September of 2011, Rita
    designated Patricia as her attorney for property under a Continuing Power of Attorney
    for Property (the “2011 CPOAP”). Patricia allegedly took advantage of her
    authority under the 2011 CPOAP and diverted several hundred thousand dollars
    from Rita to herself, leading to litigation (unrelated to this appeal), which
    ultimately settled. Against the background of Patricia’s alleged defalcation,
    Rita turned to Raymond and Pierre, and on October 18, 2013 Rita signed a power
    of attorney (the “2013 CPOAP”) naming them as her attorneys for property,
    jointly and severally. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Following settlement of the
    litigation with Patricia, Raymond and Pierre soon grew suspicious of how the
    other was handling Rita’s property. </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The
    resultant breakdown in the relationship between the two brothers caused Rita to
    make yet another change. On May 12 2015, Rita executed a new CPOAP (the “2015
    CPOAP”), the effect of which was to remove Raymond as her co-attorney for property
    and to appoint Pierre as her sole attorney for property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Raymond took issue with the 2015
    CPOAP, and on June 19, 2015 he brought an application under the </span><em>Substitute
    Decisions Act</em><i><span style='line-height:200%'>, 1992</span></i><span
style='line-height:200%'>, S.O. 1992, c. 30 (the “</span><em>SDA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>”), seeking several orders, including the removal of
    Pierre as attorney for property, and a declaration that the 2015 CPOAP was void.
    As part of this application, Raymond brought a motion, heard July 5, 2016, seeking
    an order removing Pierre as attorney for property on an interim basis pending
    determination of the application, an order appointing an interim guardian of property
    for Rita, and an order requiring Pierre to pass accounts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Other than ordering Pierre to pass
    his accounts, the motion judge dismissed the motion, and declared the 2015
    CPOAP to be valid. Raymond appeals the dismissal on the basis that the motion judge
    applied the wrong test for undue influence, erred by failing to find suspicious
    circumstances surrounding Rita’s execution of the 2015 CPOAP, and erred by
    failing to consider all of the evidence. Raymond also seeks leave to appeal the
    $55,000 in costs the motion judge ordered him to pay Rita.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons that follow, I
    would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:avoid'><b><span
style='line-height:200%'>BACKGROUND</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The events that led up to the
    execution of the 2015 CPOAP are central to this dispute. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The bulk of 92780’s funds were
    held at the Royal Bank of Canada (the “RBC”), and were frozen pursuant to the
    litigation with Patricia. In March 2015, following the settlement with
    Patricia, the RBC required all three directors of 92780 – Rita, Pierre and
    Raymond - to sign documents authorizing a new account. Raymond refused, and as
    a result approximately $600,000 of the corporation’s funds remained frozen. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The terms of the settlement with
    Patricia required her to repay Rita approximately $300,000. Raymond, acting
    unilaterally, instructed Rita’s lawyer to hold the settlement funds and not to
    release them. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The effect of Raymond’s actions
    led to Rita’s not having access to moneys she needed to pay her basic living
    expenses, including the rent at the Marleigh, her retirement home. Rita’s rent
    cheque in May 2015 was returned as her account did not have sufficient funds. The
    desperate position in which Rita found herself led to her signing the 2015
    CPOAP. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The following is a summary of the
    circumstances surrounding Rita’s execution of the 2015 CPOAP from the differing
    perspectives of Pierre/Rita and Raymond. I agree with the motion judge that it
    was not necessary to </span>resolve all factual disputes in order to resolve
    the issues in this case. The issue to be determined was narrow – whether the
    2015 CPOAP was valid. Its resolution did not require the determination of every
    factual issue in dispute.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span style='line-height:200%'>Pierre and Rita’s
    Version of Events</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Following Rita’s authorizing the 2013
    CPOAP, both Raymond and Pierre occasionally reimbursed themselves from that
    portion of the corporate account that was not frozen (at the Toronto-Dominion
    Bank), for expenses incurred on Rita’s behalf, or expenses related to the
    litigation with Patricia. However, in February 2015, Raymond, who had online
    access to all banking transactions, expressed concern over Pierre’s
    transactions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In response to this concern, Pierre
    provided Raymond with detailed banking receipts. Raymond remained suspicious of
    his brother, and in March 2015 demanded that Pierre and Rita notify the banks that,
    going forward, all cheques were to be co-signed by him. Raymond further
    demanded that the 2015 CPOAP be changed so that he and Pierre would act jointly
    as powers of attorney, rather than jointly and severally. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Not being able to appease Raymond,
    and concerned that the impasse was restricting Rita’s access to much-needed
    funds, Pierre decided to take action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On May 3, 2015 Pierre called a
    special meeting of the shareholders of 92780, to be held on May 14, 2015. The
    meeting was to ratify a resolution removing Raymond as director, enabling the
    two remaining directors, Rita and Pierre, to instruct the RBC to release Rita’s
    funds to her. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Pierre also urged Rita to make a new
    CPOAP removing Raymond, so that he (Pierre), as sole power of attorney for
    property, could instruct counsel to release the settlement funds to Rita. On
    May 12, 2015, Pierre went to Rita’s retirement home to have her execute the
    2015 CPOAP, which he had prepared following the same wording as the 2013 CPOAP.
    Rita executed the document that day. Her signature was witnessed by two staff
    members at the retirement home where Rita had lived for some time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>On May 14, 2015, before the
    shareholders’ meeting, the police were called to Rita’s residence in response
    to the escalating family dispute over the management of Rita’s finances. Rita
    told the police that Raymond was preventing her from accessing funds she needed
    to pay her living expenses, particularly her rent. The police investigated Raymond's
    suspicion that Pierre was abusing his authority as power of attorney for
    property, and eventually concluded that it was an “unfounded, civil matter”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The shareholders’ meeting went
    ahead and by 2-1 vote, Raymond was removed as director. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In response, Raymond arranged for Rita
    to undergo a capacity assessment. On May 27, 2015 Louise Silverston, a
    designated capacity assessor under the <i>SDA</i>, performed an assessment of
    Rita. The assessor concluded that Rita was capable of executing and revoking a power
    of attorney for property, pursuant to s. 8(1) of the <i>SDA</i>.</span></p>
  <h2><span style='line-height:200%'>Raymond’s Version of Events</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Raymond’s position is that Pierre
    has maintained a relationship of dominance and control over Rita for many
    years. Since 2012, Pierre has paid the bills and had performed all the
    bookkeeping for Rita and for 92780. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Following the settlement of the
    litigation with Patricia, Pierre and Raymond became engaged in a dispute
    regarding reimbursements to Pierre for expenditures claimed to have been made
    for Rita’s benefit. Raymond grew suspicious over unaccounted for monies, and
    therefore took steps to put Rita’s funds out of Pierre’s unilateral reach. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>According to Raymond, Pierre
    induced Rita into signing the 2015 CPOAP, as well as into approving the
    corporate resolution removing Raymond as director of 92780, by telling her that
    if she did not sign, she would not have access to any of her money. Fearing
    eviction from her retirement home, Rita signed the resolution and the 2015
    CPOAP. The result was to give Pierre exclusive control over the family
    corporation and its assets.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Raymond says the staff at the
    retirement home called the police out of concern over Pierre’s conduct towards
    Rita. Raymond says the police report shows that Rita was led to believe that
    the only way she could access her money and pay her rent was by removing him

    Silverston had found that, as of May 27, 2015, Rita had the capacity to grant
    and revoke a power of attorney. In the light of this professional evidence,

    view, at para. 10, that the burden of proof to establish undue influence rests
    with the party alleging it. The motion judge set out the test for undue
    influence as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The extent of the influence must amount to coercion; simple
    influence is not enough. The testator’s free will must be overborne. Put
    another way, it is not improper for any potential beneficiary to attempt to
    influence the decision of the testator provided the pleading does not amount to
    coercion and the latter continues to act as a free agent. </p>

    (3d) 55, which held that where there are suspicious circumstances of undue
    influence surrounding the execution of a power of attorney, the presumption of

    with respect to capacity shifts to the grantee of the power of attorney.</span></p>

    according to Raymond, the suspicious circumstances included the fact that
    Pierre had drafted the 2015 CPOAP, that Rita had not been provided with
    independent legal advice and that Pierre had told her that if she did not sign
    the document she would have no access to her funds. Raymond also relied on the
    assessor’s view that Rita had been subjected to undue influence.</span></p>

    evidence did not support a finding of suspicious circumstances. Given the
    assessor’s opinion that Rita had the capacity to execute a power of authority,
    the motion judge attached little weight to Pierre’s having drafted the 2015
    CPOAP, or to Rita’s having signed it without independent legal advice. The motion
    judge found that Pierre's alleged statements about Rita’s not having access to
    her money unless she signed the 2015 CPOAP were uncorroborated. In any event,
    such statements were either true or based on a reasonable perception of what
    was going on, as it was Raymond’s conduct that, arguably, had created the
    restrictions on Rita’s access to her money. </span></p>

    the part of the capacity assessment to the effect that Rita had been the

    concluded that Rita had the capacity to execute the 2015 CPOAP, and that it had
    not been the product of undue influence. Raymond had not shown any evidence of
    impropriety on Pierre’s part rising beyond the level of Raymond’s distrust and
    speculation. There was therefore no basis to interfere with the 2015 CPOAP.</span></p>

    that as the role of power of attorney was fiduciary in nature, a person holding
    it must be prepared to account for his administration of someone else’s
    property. Pierre was therefore ordered to pass his accounts on July 14, 2016,
    and on an annual basis thereafter. </span></p>

    month later, the motion judge expressed the view that this “relatively

    … all out of proportion to the monetary stakes.” He went on to say that Rita
    had been put to significant expense by Raymond, and was therefore entitled to
    her costs from him. Leaving Pierre’s costs to the passing of accounts, the motion
    judge ordered Raymond to pay Rita’s costs fixed in the amount of $55,000. </span></p>

    a relationship between two people, where one acquires a measure of influence or
    ascendancy over another, of which the ascendant person takes unfair advantage.
    The law has long recognized the need to prevent abuse of influence in these

    presence of a relationship of dominance, trust or confidence (such as has
    existed between Rita and Pierre for some time), the court will assume that the

    test is traditionally applied to <i>inter vivos </i>gifts improperly taken, it
    equally applies to <i>inter vivos </i>transfers of power over the grantor’s
    assets. Accordingly, Pierre’s dominance over Rita triggers the presumption of
    undue influence in regards to the Rita’s execution of the 2015 CPOAP. Since Pierre
    has failed to lead evidence to rebut the presumption of undue influence, the
    2015 CPOAP should be set aside.</span></p>

    relevant in the circumstances of this case. Rita argues that the test of presumptive <i>inter vivos </i>undue influence, in which specific overt acts of coercion
    need not be established where there is a relationship of trust or dominance, is
    restricted to circumstances where the trusted person has a received a “large or
    immoderate benefit” from the transaction. However, there is no evidence of that
    here. Raymond’s argument is not founded on evidence that Pierre misappropriated
    Rita’s assets, but on the suspicion that such might occur. Further, Pierre
    gained nothing under the 2015 CPOAP that he did not already have under the 2013
    CPOAP: the only impact was Raymond’s loss of authority.</span></p>

    impact of using the<i> inter vivos</i> test is that the onus would shift to
    Pierre to demonstrate no undue influence. This is, of course, a rebuttable

    noted by the House of Lords in <i>Eltridge</i>, at paras. 21-22, there are two
    prerequisites to the evidential shift in the burden of proof from the
    complainant (Raymond, arguing on behalf of Rita) to the other party (Pierre).
    First, the complainant reposed trust and confidence in the other party. Second,
    the transaction is not readily explicable by the parties’ relationship. This
    second part of the test has been held by the House of Lords to mean that the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    that the law regarding suspicious circumstances has historically only been
    applied to wills. It was only in the recent case of <i>Nguyen </i>that the
    doctrine was applied in the context of powers of attorney. Rita submits that <i>Nguyen </i>was wrongly decided, and should not be applied in these circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    circumstances in the preparation of a will are established, the general
    presumption of capacity to execute a will is displaced, and the onus of proof
    on the question of capacity shifts to the propounder of the document. The most
    commonly recognized example of a suspicious circumstance is when a person who
    is instrumental in the making of a will obtains a benefit under it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>However, Rita argues,
    there are two reasons why the doctrine ought not to be applied in cases
    involving powers of attorney. First, unlike cases involving wills, an attorney
    for property who is involved in the preparation of a power of attorney cannot
    be said to have received a “benefit” by that appointment, in that neither legal
    nor equitable title to any property is transferred by virtue of the appointment.
    Second, the doctrine exists, in part, because evidence to prove or disprove
    undue influence is often unavailable in wills cases. Conversely, in cases such
    as this, the grantor of the power of attorney is still alive, has not been
    declared incapable, and can provide evidence surrounding the execution of the
    document.</span></p>

    is much evidence as to how the 2015 CPOAP came to be signed. There are contemporaneous
    statements made by Rita to Raymond, Pierre, the assessor, and the police about
    why she signed the 2015 CPOAP. This evidence exists because Pierre made no
    attempt to conceal what he was doing from anyone. The motion judge was correct
    in finding that there was no evidence of suspicious circumstances. It is clear
    what Pierre did, and why. </span></p>

    see this appeal as an appropriate one in which to consider the application of
    the doctrine of suspicious circumstances to powers of attorney as a whole. In
    front of the motion judge, counsel for Rita dealt with <i>Nguyen </i>briefly,
    arguing that as Pierre had gained no benefit under the 2015 CPOAP, the doctrine
    of suspicious circumstances did not apply. As I read the transcript, counsel
    was not suggesting that the doctrine of suspicious circumstances could never
    apply in the context of powers of attorney, or that <i>Nguyen</i> should not be
    followed.</span></p>

    Rita’s right to refuse to participate. The assessor did tell Rita her capacity
    to grant and revoke powers of attorney would be assessed. However, the assessor
    did not tell Rita that allegations of undue influence were being investigated. Rita

    judge when he expressed the view that both Raymond and Pierre had “lost sight
    of the fact that it is Rita’s best interests that must be served here, not
    their own pride, suspicions, authority or desires”. I support this view
    particularly in the light of the submissions Rita personally made to the panel
    in the course of the hearing. Notwithstanding that she was ably represented by
    counsel, Rita, on two occasions during argument, asked and obtained permission
    to address the court. On both occasions, Rita professed her love for both of
    her sons, but in no uncertain terms Rita also powerfully conveyed her
    frustration over the damage that the family has suffered as a result of these seemingly
    meritless proceedings.</span></p>
