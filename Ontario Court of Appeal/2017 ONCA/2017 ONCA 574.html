  <p class=Endorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents are 28 members of Branch 1-7 of the
    appellant, The Polish Alliance of Canada (“PAC”). The application judge, Myers
    J., granted judgment in the respondents’ favour, permitting them to depart from
    Branch 1-7 (and, as a consequence, from PAC) and continue as members of a
    separate and independent not-for-profit corporation, taking with them a property
    held in trust for the members from time to time of Branch 1-7. PAC appeals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the following reasons, the appeal is
    dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The judgment under appeal is hopefully the final
    step in a long-standing dispute between PAC and Branch 1-7. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>PAC is an umbrella organization incorporated
    under the <em>Corporations Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.38. The respondents are
    all the members of Branch 1-7, a local unincorporated branch of PAC.  PAC and
    Branch 1-7 are voluntary associations that have as their objects to promote the
    general cultural, education and social welfare interests of their members. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The dispute led to a lengthy trial before Myers
    J.  In his trial reasons, Myers J. found that title to Branch 1-7’s clubhouse
    on Lakeshore Boulevard in Toronto (the “Property”), estimated to be worth $50
    million or more, was held in trust for the members from time to time of Branch
    1-7.  However, he also determined that the purported withdrawal of Branch 1-7
    from PAC was invalid because the unanimous consent of Branch 1-7’s members had
    not been obtained: <em>The Polish Association of Canada v. Polish Association
    of Toronto Limited</em>, 2014 ONSC 3216, [2014] O.J. No. 2542. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The then-members of Branch 1-7 appealed Myers
    J.’s determination that their withdrawal was invalid, and PAC in turn
    cross-appealed. PAC’s cross-appeal was dismissed and it was precluded from
    making any response to the appeal because of its failure to file materials
    within the required deadlines.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> This court found that there was no basis to
    interfere with Myers J.’s determination that the purported withdrawal by Branch
    1-7 from PAC was invalid. However, it noted that he did not determine that any
    future attempt would be invalid or ineffective:  <em>The Polish Alliance of
    Canada v. Polish Association of Toronto Limited</em>, 2016 ONCA 445, [2016]
    O.J. No. 3820. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsequently, the respondents brought an
    application before Myers J. for judgment declaring that they were entitled to
    leave PAC and take the Property with them. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Myers J. found that, this time, 100% of the
    members of Branch 1-7 had voted to leave PAC. He held that the “clubman’s veto”
    applied. Citing <em>Wawrzyniak v. Jagiellicz</em> (1998), 64 O.R. (2d) 81
    (H.C.J.), at pp. 88-89, he explained this common law rule provides that with
    the approval of 100% of the members of an unincorporated association, the
    members can leave the association and take the property of the association with
    them. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While Myers J. found the clubman’s veto took the
    members of Branch 1-7 “where they want to be”, he commented that had the matter
    been presented under the <em>Variation of Trusts Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. V.
    1, he would have had no hesitation approving a variation of trust to transfer
    the Property to a not-for-profit corporation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He granted the requested judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>PAC’s Arguments on Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>PAC argues that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Myers J. erred in concluding that the clubman’s veto applied; </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in any event, there were more members of Branch 1-7 than Myers J.
    determined, with the result that he erred in concluding that 100% of the
    members voted to leave;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Myers J. erred in concluding that the Property was held in trust for the
    members of Branch 1-7 from time to time; and </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>neither party had argued the application of the <em>Variation of Trusts
    Act</em> and Myers J. therefore erred by suggesting it as an alternative basis
    for the relief he granted.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reject PAC’s arguments.</span></p>
  <h2><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Myers J. did not err in
    concluding that the clubman’s veto applied</span></em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>PAC does not take issue with Myers J.’s
    articulation of the common law rule sometimes called “the clubman’s veto”<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[1]</span></span></span></a>. Rather, it renews its
    argument before Myers J., relying on <em>Ahenakew v. MacKay </em>(2004), 71
    O.R. (3d) 130 (C.A.), that the clubman’s veto does not apply in these
    circumstances because PAC is incorporated under the <em>Corporations Act</em>,
    and it has supplanted the clubman’s veto.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor does PAC dispute Myers J.’s finding that
    PAC’s constitution does not deal with how a branch can leave PAC.  However, it
    says PAC’s by-laws must be amended with the approval of a 2/3 majority of PAC’s
    members to create a process for disaffiliation of the members of Branch 1- 7
    and Branch 1-7 must then comply with any such process to leave PAC, with the
    Property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reject this argument.  In our view, Myers J.
    correctly determined that the clubman’s veto applied. The respondents – the
    then members of Branch 1-7, an unincorporated association – sought to leave
    that association and take with them the Property held in trust for the members
    from time to time of Branch 1-7.  This case is very different from <em>Ahenakew</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>Ahenakew</em>, this court concluded the
    unanimous consent of all members of the Progressive Conservative Party of
    Canada (the “PC Party”) was not required for the PC Party to merge with the
    Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance Party. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Goudge J.A., writing for the court, reviewed
    this court’s earlier decision in <em>Astgen v. Smith</em>, [1970] 1 O.R. 129
    (C.A.). He explained that the majority in <em>Astgen</em> held that the common
    law recognized the voluntary association not as a legal entity, but as nothing
    more than a complex of contracts between each member and every other member.
    The majority held that something such as a merger with another voluntary
    association so fundamentally affects the contractual rights of each member that
    each member must consent to a termination of his or her existing set of
    contractual relations directly or through a procedure to which all members had
    agreed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>Ahenakew</em>, this court held that the
    common law requirement of unanimous consent did not apply to the proposed
    merger involving the PC Party. The legal fiction that a voluntary association
    is simply a complex of contracts between all its members was inapplicable
    because the <em>Canada Elections Act</em> clothed the PC Party with legal
    status as a registered political party. And since this legal fiction was
    inapplicable, so too was the corollary requirement that unanimous consent of
    its members be obtained to a merger.  Further, Parliament displaced the common
    law rule by including detailed provisions in the <em>Canada Elections Act</em> about what is necessary for the merger of two registered political parties. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While PAC is incorporated under the <em>Corporations
    Act</em>, Branch 1-7 of PAC is an unincorporated voluntary association. Unlike
    in <em>Ahenakew</em>, there is no legislation that gives Branch 1-7 of PAC a
    legal status that would displace the legal construct identified in <em>Astgen</em>. 
    And, unlike in <em>Ahenakew</em>, there is no statute that governs how the
    contractual relationship of all the members of Branch 1-7 with each other is to
    be terminated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As Myers J. summarized, at para. 23:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>While the clubman’s veto, like any common law
    principle, can be displaced by a clear statute as was found to be the case of
    political parties in </span><em>Ahenakew</em><span lang=EN-US>, there is
    nothing in the </span><em>Corporations Act</em><span lang=EN-US> or any
    regulatory scheme that regulate this situation…Nothing in the </span><em>Corporations
    Act</em><span lang=EN-US> deals with the problem of how trust beneficiaries
    whose interests are defined with reference to their membership in an
    unincorporated branch of an incorporated entity can leave with their property.</span></p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no basis to interfere with Myers J.’s finding that 100% of the
    members of Branch 1-7 had voted to leave</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In calculating the number of members of Branch
    1-7, Myers J. relied on the order dated September 3, 2014, as amended by order
    dated September 17, 2014, determining that at that time there were 20 members.
    It is not now open to PAC to seek to go behind the prior court orders and argue
    that there were more than 20 members at that time, and therefore more than the
    total number of members Myers J. determined.  Further, this argument is
    inconsistent with its position before Myers J. that there were no members of
    Branch 1-7 remaining.</span></p>
