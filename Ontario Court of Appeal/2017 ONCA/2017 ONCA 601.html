    July 26, 2016.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The child, A.N., was made a ward of Valoris pour
    enfants et adultes de Prescott-Russell (the “Society”) at the age of two months.
    In December 2015, when he was seven months old, he was placed with a
    foster-to-adopt mother (the “F-A mother”).   The Society filed a status review
    application in January 2016 requesting the child be made a Crown ward with no
    access rights to the parents. As detailed in their application and plan of care
    dated June 7, 2016, the Society’s position was that if the child was made a
    Crown ward, it would support the F-A mother as the adoptive parent for the
    child. An uncontested trial of the Society’s application for Crown wardship was
    scheduled and adjourned pending the opportunity for the biological parents to
    move to set aside their noting in default. No such motion was brought.  A
    paternal aunt and her partner expressed an intention to adopt the child early
    in 2016. In June 2016 the Society decided to support that plan instead. The paternal
    aunt and her partner filed a motion seeking to be added as parties and for a
    temporary order for care of the child. That motion was adjourned. The F-A mother
    brought a motion seeking to be added as a party to the child protection
    proceeding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is only one issue on this appeal:  whether
    the Divisional Court erred in overturning the motion judge’s decision to add
    the F-A mother as a party to the child protection proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, it did.  We would allow the appeal and
    reinstate the motion judge’s order to grant the F-A mother party status in this
    matter.</span></p>
  <p class=StrongUnderline>The Motion Judge’s Decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge reviewed the child’s history, including the
    circumstances leading to the Society’s wardship, and the evidence offered by
    the F-A mother, of the child’s progress while in her care.   He noted that the
    F-A mother was coordinating and pursuing three areas of medical treatment for
    the child.  He also noted the difference between traditional foster parents and
    foster-to-adopt parents:  the clear understanding between the Society and foster-to-adopt
    parents is that children are placed with them with an ultimate goal of
    adoption.  Foster-to-adopt parents are assessed with the view that they will
    adopt the child.  It was also undisputed that the child’s birth mother is in
    favour of an adoption by the F-A mother and that both women agree that there
    should be continuing access with the birth mother if the child is adopted by
    the F-A mother.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge considered conflicting jurisprudence
    as to whether foster parents should be made parties to a proceeding like this. 
    He quoted this court’s comments in </span><em>L.(R.) v. Children’s Aid Society
    of the Niagara Region</em> <span lang=EN-US>(2002), 34 R.F.L. (5th) 44, at
    para. 38 that “…</span><span class=Underline>prior</span> <span lang=EN-US>to
    the initial hearing foster parents are meant to provide temporary care for
    children pending their return to their family or transfer to a more permanent
    placement.  They are not intended to provide a comparative basis for the
    determination of the child’s best interests </span><span class=Underline>from
    the outset </span><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>(emphasis
    added).” He noted that in this case the initial hearing and finding that the
    child was in need of protection had already occurred.  He relied on this
    court’s statement in <i>L.(R</i>.</span></span><em>)</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>at para. 50 that, “depending on the circumstances, the ultimate
    determination of a permanent placement may well involve such a contest [between
    the child’s family and the child’s foster parents.]. When it does, it is the
    best interest of the child, not the rights of the family or the foster parents
    that is determinative of the outcome.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge began his analysis of whether the F-A
    mother should be added as a party to the child protection proceedings, by
    observing that s. 1 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Child and Family
    Services Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (“CFSA”)<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> clearly states the purpose
    of the CFSA:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The paramount purpose of this Act is to
    promote the best interests, protection and well being of children.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He noted that s. 39(1) provides who will
    automatically be parties to a child protection proceeding, but does not limit
    parties to those listed. He also noted that s. 39(3) of the CFSA provides a
    limited right of participation for non-parties to a child protection
    proceeding.  Those sections provide as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>39(1) </span>The following are parties to a
    proceeding under this Part:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          1. The applicant.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          2. The society having jurisdiction in the matter.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          3. The child’s parent.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>  4. Where the
    child is an Indian or a native person, a representative chosen by the child’s
    band or native community.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>39(3)&#8194;Any person, including a foster
    parent, who has cared for the child continuously during the six months
    immediately before the hearing,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(a) is entitled to the same notice of the
    proceeding as a party;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(b) may be present at the hearing;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(c) may be represented by a solicitor; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(d) may make submissions to the court,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>but shall take no further part in the hearing
    without leave of the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge concluded, at para. 47, that “[g]ranting
    such rights to non-parties, including a foster parent, is not an indication by
    the legislature that a foster parent should not be made a party.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He considered the facts of the case and, at
    para. 53, found that “this [F-A mother]; not the biological parents, their
    extended family members, nor the Society, is in the best position to inform the
    Court on a Crown wardship hearing as to what the specific needs are and what is
    in the best interests of this child.” </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He ordered that the F-A mother be a party to the
    proceeding or, if a higher court disagreed with that determination, that the
    F-A mother have full rights to participate in this proceeding pursuant to s.
    39(3) of the CFSA. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the motion judge’s decision, the Society

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court noted that the motion judge
    had not mentioned rules 7(4) and 7(5) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Family
    Law Rules</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, O. Reg. 114/99:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>7(4) In any of the following cases, every
    parent or other person who has care and control of the child involved, except a
    foster parent under the </span><em>Child and Family Services Act</em><span

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>7(5) The court may order that any person who

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While it rejected the Society’s argument that
    the effect of r. 7(4) is that the court cannot make a foster parent a party in
    a child protection case, it concluded that the discretion to add a party under r.
    7(5) should be exercised with caution and a foster parent should be added as a
    party only in exceptional circumstances. In the case of foster parents, the
    court should consider their existing participation rights under s. 39(3) of the
    CFSA. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The Divisional Court held that in determining
    whether a foster parent should be added as a party, the court should consider the
    following criteria:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US>(1) Is
    adding the party necessary for a determination of the issues in the case?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>(2)  Would
    adding the party cause delays in the process?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US>(3) Does

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It concluded that the motion judge failed to
    consider all these criteria such that the Divisional Court was entitled to
    interfere with the motion judge’s exercise of discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While the motion judge concluded that it was
    necessary to make the F-A mother a party, in the Divisional Court’s view, he
    overlooked the existing presumptive rights of participation of the F-A mother
    under the CFSA and the fact that she could request permission from the court to
    have her participatory rights expanded.  Further, in its view, the Society had
    relevant information in its files and could call the F-A mother as a witness if

    CFSA preserve the court’s discretion to add a foster parent as a party to a
    child protection proceeding.   We agree that the power to add such a person as a
    party should not be exercised lightly.  However, the Divisional Court
    circumscribed the exercise of that discretion too narrowly. While delay and legal
    interest are relevant, they are not, by themselves, determinative.  The
    overarching consideration is the child’s best interests.  The motion judge
    determined that on the facts of this case, the F-A mother’s participation as a
    party was both necessary and in the child’s best interests.   Further, we do
    not agree with the Divisional Court’s assessment of the delay and legal
    interest factors. </span></p>

    motion judge’s refusal to grant her party status or expanded participatory
    rights.  On appeal, Czutrin J. granted her expanded participatory rights,
    specifically, the right to pretrial disclosure as a party and to call and
    cross-examine witnesses. He stated at paras. 20 and 21:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>For very good and appropriate reasons, foster
    parents’ rights are limited prior to an order making the child a Crown ward. At
    the same time, even if the foster mother were not added as a party, s. 39(3) of
    the CFSA leaves open (and in fact contemplates) that the court may grant foster
    parents rights to participate more fully. There is certainly no absolute
    prohibition against doing so.  The motions judge overemphasized the option of
    placing the child with his grandparents in the context [of] considering the
    foster parent’s rights of participation at this stage.  The motions judge should
    have also considered the impact on the child of the time that has passed in
    this case without resolution and the people who could best bring to light his
    best interests.  The Act should be read and balanced as a whole.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I find that the Court must, on a case-by-case
    and contextual basis, consider whether to grant leave to allow foster parents
    greater rights of participation, </span><span class=Underline>up to and
    including party status</span><span lang=EN-US>. These considerations might
    include:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>1. The age of the child and the time line
    considerations of the CFSA;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>2. Whether there has been a finding of a
    need of protection at the time the request for participation is made;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>3. Whether the foster parents will be
    called to testify and whether their evidence will be challenged;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>4. Whether the persons or parents who had
    charge of the child at the time of commencement of the proceedings are
    presenting a plan;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>5. The time of continuing placement of the
    child;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>6. Whether there has been any contact with

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>7. Whether the application has been

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>8. Such other considerations that suggest
    the foster parent’s involvement would clarify the best interests of the child.

    arrival at the F-A mother’s home in a state of emotional disarray, and his
    emotional progress in recovery in the following months. He concluded that, as a
    result, the F-A mother was in the best position to inform the Court as to the
    specific needs and best interest of the child. In his view, and in the
    circumstances of this case, where the Society had changed course after
    approving the F-A mother to become an adoptive parent, this warranted her
    involvement.  In <em>S.(R.D.)</em> Czutrin J. found a need for expanded
    participatory rights despite the fact the child was represented by OCL counsel
    who could neutrally collect and present best interests information to the court. 
    Here, unlike in <em>S.(R.D.)</em>, the OCL is not involved. </span></p>

    reason to expect the F-A mother’s involvement would add considerable delay. As

    asked to adjourn or delay the proceedings.  </span></p>

    proceedings, depending on the outcome of the proceedings, any opportunity for
    her to adopt the child would be foreclosed. In this sense her legal interests
    are affected.   The decision here however does not turn on the question of the
    existence, nature or extent of the F-A mother’s legal interest.  As correctly
    pointed out by the motion judge, the protection and pursuit of the child’s best
    interests, rather than the rights of the F-A mother, are the central issue.</span></p>

    remained in the care of the F-A mother, spending two days each week with his

    open to the motion judge to find that the F-A mother’s involvement in the child
