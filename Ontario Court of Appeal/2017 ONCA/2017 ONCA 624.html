  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of oral submissions, we dismissed the appeal with
    reasons to follow. These are those reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of possession of child pornography and
    making child pornography available. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment
    for possession and two years for making available, served concurrently. He
    appeals his convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred: (i) in
    dismissing his application under s. 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>; (ii) in
    dismissing his application under s. 8 of the <em>Charter;</em> and<em> </em>(iii)
    in his credibility assessments of defence witnesses. The appellant also seeks
    leave to appeal his sentence on the basis that the trial judge erred in failing
    to apply the<em> Kienapple</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> principle. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background </h1>
  <h2>Facts </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s conviction arose from his alleged use of a file-sharing
    network called GigaTribe. The critical evidence against the appellant came from
    Detective Sergeant Parisien. Parisien is an officer with the Saskatoon Police Service
    who has extensive experience investigating child exploitation and the use of GigaTribe.
    GigaTribe is a closed, peer-to-peer network, meaning users must invite and
    connect to others to share files. In Parisien’s experience, he had seen “little
    or no one using [GigaTribe] for any legitimate purpose.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 14, 2010, Parisien was investigating GigaTribe using a covert
    account. He received three messages from user “Peter1111”. Parisien saw that
    Peter1111 was sharing three identical folders, which each contained 1,310 files,
    totalling 825 megabytes. They contained child pornography. Parisien subsequently
    obtained Peter1111’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, determined the relevant
    Internet Service Provider, and requested and received the subscriber
    information. This information revealed the user of the Peter1111 account was in
    Mississauga, Ontario, so Parisien passed the file over to the Peel Regional
    Police. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Peel Regional Police submitted an information to obtain (“ITO”) in
    November 2011. They executed a warranted search at the appellant’s residence on
    December 22, 2011 and seized a laptop.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police Constable MacDonald – an expert in forensic computer analysis
    with the Peel Regional Police – examined the laptop and testified that
    GigaTribe was installed on the computer with the single user account Peter1111.
    There were 49 images of readily accessible child pornography on the laptop. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charges were laid against the appellant on January 6, 2012. He was
    arrested on January 16, 2012.</p>
  <h2>Section 11(b) application</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 2, 2013, the appellant applied for an order staying the charges
    on the basis that his s. 11(b) <em>Charter</em> rights had been violated. The
    trial judge dismissed the application with reasons to follow. The reasons were
    never delivered. </p>
  <h2>Section 8 application</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant changed counsel at the end of April 2013. On October 11,
    2013, the appellant’s new counsel brought an application to exclude the laptop
    information on the basis that the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the<em> Charter</em> had been violated. He submitted that Parisien had intercepted and recorded
    the appellant’s private communications without prior judicial authorization. This
    information formed the basis for the ITO, which then became tainted. He also
    argued the delay involved in the transfer of the file from Saskatoon to the Peel
    Regional Police meant the information relied on in the ITO was “stale-dated”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the application. </p>
  <h2>The trial</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    matter proceeded to trial and the appellant testified. He confirmed he had
    downloaded GigaTribe onto the laptop and Peter1111 was his user name. He denied
    using GigaTribe for child pornography purposes. He testified his computer was
    password protected, but everybody knew the password, and he would often leave
    it lying around the house (where his brother also lived). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s brother testified that he used the laptop and he downloaded child
    pornography onto that laptop. He said he would do this while the appellant was
    sleeping or not at home, using GigaTribe, which was already installed on the
    laptop.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the evidence of the appellant and his brother. The trial
    judge then reviewed the principles set out in the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>R.
    v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. Applying those principles, he concluded
    the Crown had met its burden and convicted the appellant of both possession of
    child pornography and making child pornography available.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted on July 14, 2014. The appellant changed counsel again
    and was ultimately sentenced on May 20, 2015.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Issues</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in not providing reasons for his dismissal of the
    appellant’s s. 11(b) <em>Charter </em>application.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in not finding a breach of the appellant’s rights
    under s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em> and by not excluding evidence obtained as a
    result of that breach pursuant to s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in his credibility assessments of defence
    witnesses.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in not staying the conviction for possession of
    child pornography pursuant to the <em>Kienapple</em> principle.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Discussion</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in not providing reasons for his dismissal of
    the appellant’s s. 11(b) <em>Charter </em>application?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Crown acknowledged, the trial judge erred in principle by failing to
    provide reasons for his decision to dismiss the appellant’s s. 11(b) application. <em>R. v. Sheppard</em>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, has been repeatedly
    cited and relied on to underscore a judge’s obligation to deliver a reasoned
    decision.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits the judge’s failure to provide reasons requires this court to
    order a new trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. As also stated in <em>Sheppard</em>,<em> </em>there is no need
    for a new trial when the appellate court considers itself able to explain the
    result to the parties. In this situation, the error of law can be cured
    pursuant to the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46: <em>Sheppard</em>, at para. 55.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were no credibility issues before the court on the s. 11(b) motion. The parties
    filed factums. This court is able to explain the result to the parties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application was argued under the framework in <em>R. v. Morin</em>, [1992] 1
    S.C.R. 771. The evidence disclosed that, although the intake period occasioned
    a slight delay, the court was ready to set trial dates in May 2012 for later
    the same year. The appellant, however, declined to set a target trial date
    until he had the final forensic report. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    a trial date was set, the trial was anticipated to conclude in July 2013. On
    the s. 11(b) application, the court considered this anticipated trial
    completion date to calculate the period of delay. Thus, on April 2, 2013 – when
    the application judge heard and decided the s. 11(b) application – the relevant
    period of delay was 17 months, 24 days. This is below the post-<em>Jordan </em>18-month
    presumptive ceiling for matters in the Ontario Court of Justice, and there is
    no evidence supporting a stay under these circumstances: <em>R. v. Jordan</em>,
    2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits the period of delay for this court’s consideration
    should be expanded. Despite the anticipated end date of July 2013, the trial
    was not actually started until October 2013, and it was not completed until May
    2014. Judgment was delivered in July 2014. This resulted in a period of delay
    of over 29 months. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem with the appellant’s submission with respect to the expanded timeframe
    is that this court has not been provided with a record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    recent decision of this court in <em>R. v. Gordon</em>, 2017 ONCA 436, sets out
    the steps to follow where a matter that was started under the pre-<em>Jordan</em> system is determined post-<em>Jordan</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    any time attributable to defence delay must be subtracted from the total delay
    to determine the “net delay”. From the partial record before this court, it is
    clear there is delay attributable to the defence. For example, the appellant changed
    lawyers twice. Second, the court must consider any “exceptional circumstances”
    or unexpected events. Third, the court must consider the “transitional
    exceptional circumstances” arising from reasonable reliance on the <em>Morin </em>criteria.
    As Doherty J.A. stated in <em>Gordon</em>, at<em> </em>paras. 19 and 23:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Jordan</em> recognized that the new approach to delay could
    not simply be applied without qualification to those cases that were in the
    system prior to the release of <em>Jordan</em> and had proceeded on the basis
    that <em>Morin</em> established the constitutional standard for unreasonable
    delay. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In most cases, especially when all of the delay occurred prior
    to the release of <em>Jordan</em>, if the court concludes that the delay was
    not unreasonable under <em>Morin</em>, the transitional exceptional
    circumstance described in <em>Jordan</em> will justify delays beyond [the
    presumptive ceiling].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    absence of a record creates an insurmountable hurdle for the appellant. We are
    unable to consider the reasonableness of the delay – or indeed where the onus
    lies – without a record of events after <span style='line-height:100%'>April 2,
    2013</span>. On an 11(b) application, the court expects all transcripts of all
    relevant proceedings to be filed: <span style='line-height:100%'>see </span><em>R.
    v. Allen</em><span style='line-height:100%'> (1996), 92 O.A.C. 345, at p. 344</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    therefore conclude the trial judge did not err in dismissing the April 2, 2013
    application, and we are unable to expand the inquiry to include the actual time
    to judgment, as there is no record. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in not finding a breach of the appellant’s
    rights under s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em> and by not excluding evidence

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the trial judge dismissed the appellant’s s. 8 application, he did not have the
    benefit of the Supreme Court’s decision in <em><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>R. v. Spencer</span></em>, <span
lang=EN>2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212,</span> which found that requests for Internet
    subscriber information that are warrantless engage serious privacy interests
    and therefore violate s. 8 of the <em>Charter. </em>The Crown concedes,
    pursuant to <em>Spencer</em>, the appellant’s s. 8 rights were infringed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits there was a further breach of s. 8 because of the staleness
    of the information underlying the ITO. We do not agree. The application judge concluded,
    based on the evidence available to the judicial officer considering the ITO,
    that there were reasonable and probable grounds to believe there was evidence
    that could be obtained from a search warrant. We see no basis to interfere with
    that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree, however, in light of <em>Spencer</em>,<em> </em>the appellant’s <em>Charter </em>rights were violated with respect to the police’s requests for Internet
    subscriber information. Having found otherwise, the application judge did not
    proceed to a s. 24(2) analysis. This court, however, is in a position to do so. </p>

lang=EN>The test for applying s. 24(2) is set out in </span><em>R. v. Grant</em><span
lang=EN>, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353. The court must “assess and balance
    the effect of admitting the evidence on society’s confidence in the justice
    system”, having regard to the following factors: (1) the seriousness of the </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN>-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN>-protected interests of the accused; and (3) society’s interest in the
    adjudication of the case on its merits: </span><em>Grant</em><span lang=EN>, at
    para. 71. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[32]<span

lang=EN>Here, the state conduct cannot be characterized as a willful or
    flagrant disregard of the </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN>. The law was
    different at the time of the search, and the nature of the police conduct in
    this case would not tend to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</span></p>

lang=EN>-</span><span lang=EN>infringing conduct on the appellant’s </span><em>Charter</em><span

    the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a

    the case on the merits</span></a><span lang=EN>. As explained in </span><em>Grant</em><span
lang=EN>, while the public has a heightened interest in seeing a determination
    on the merits where the offence charged is serious, it also has a vital
    interest in having a justice system that is above reproach: </span><em>Grant</em><span
lang=EN>, at para. 84. </span></p>

lang=EN>The offences here involve the victimization of children. The trial
    judge opined that the images were among the most extreme he had ever seen. If
    the evidence is excluded, the Crown will effectively have no case. The impugned
    evidence (the electronic files containing child pornography) is reliable and
    was admitted by the defence at trial to constitute child pornography. Society
    undoubtedly has an interest in seeing a full and fair trial based on reliable
    evidence, and all the more so for a crime which implicates the safety of
    children. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is notable that in <em>Spencer,</em> Cromwell J. balanced the three factors in <em>Grant</em> and concluded: <span lang=EN>“exclusion of the evidence rather than its admission
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute”: at para. 81. Here,
    we come to the same conclusion.</span></p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in his credibility assessments of defence
    witnesses?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits the trial judge held the defence witnesses to a different
    standard than he did the Crown’s with respect to their credibility. In
    particular, the trial judge referred to Crown witnesses’ evidence as being
    “uncontradicted” and referred explicitly to evidence he would have expected the
    defence to lead to support its theory – for example, evidence there had been a
    virus installed on the appellant’s computer, or evidence that would refute the
    believed identity of the Peter1111 account’s user – which effectively reversed
    the burden of proof. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explicitly adverted to the Supreme Court’s judgment in <em>W.(D.)</em> and applied it to his reasons. In referring to the Crown’s witnesses’ evidence
    as “uncontradicted”, the trial judge did not reverse the burden of proof.
    Rather, he was describing the state of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did the trial judge subject defence evidence to a higher level of scrutiny than
    the Crown’s evidence. The main aspects of the witnesses’ testimony did not
    overlap. The Crown’s witnesses testified largely to the results of forensic
    examination of the appellant’s computer, whereas the appellant and his brother
    were discussing the use of the computer. In any event, the trial judge gave
    cogent and detailed reasons for his findings, which are entitled to deference.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence on the basis that the trial judge
    should have applied the <em>Kienapple </em>principle to stay the charge of making
    child pornography available because both convictions arose from the same facts
    and time period. In failing to do so, the trial judge committed a reversible
    error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no legal nexus between the offences of possession of child pornography and
    making child pornography available. The former involves possession, the latter
    involves distribution. In the circumstances of this case, a factual nexus is
    also absent. In any event, since the sentences were imposed concurrently, there
    is no practical result stemming from applying the <em>Kienapple </em>principle
    in terms of the effect on the overall sentence.</p>
