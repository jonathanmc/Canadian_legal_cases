  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on July 16, 2015
    and the sentence imposed on September 22, 2015 by Justice Nancy A. Dawson of
    the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Laskin J.A.:</strong><span style='font-weight:normal'> </span></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yancy Loor was a low-level member of a small drug trafficking ring
    dealing in fentanyl. Starting in early July 2013, Loor used a forged prescription
    to obtain 45 patches of fentanyl – 15 at a time – from a pharmacy in Barrie. He
    was eventually charged and tried in the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue at trial was identity: was Loor the person who obtained
    the fentanyl? The evidence of identity was circumstantial as neither of the two
    pharmacists who dispensed the prescription could identify Loor as the person
    who came to the pharmacy to get the prescription filled. Loor did not testify. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In lengthy and thorough reasons the trial judge found Loor guilty of
    three counts of using a forged document (the prescription) and three counts of
    trafficking in fentanyl. She sentenced him to 6 years in jail less 18 months
    credit for pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loor appeals both his conviction and his sentence. On his conviction
    appeal he submits that the verdict was unreasonable for two related reasons:
    the evidence was not sufficient to prove identity beyond a reasonable doubt;
    and the trial judge could reasonably infer from the evidence that another
    person, even another member of the trafficking ring, could have impersonated
    Loor, using fake identification. On his sentence appeal, Loor submits that six
    years was excessive, disproportionate to his level in the trafficking ring hierarchy,
    and inconsistent with the sentences imposed on two of the higher-ups.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did not call on the Crown on the conviction appeal and it is
    dismissed. I would also dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conviction appeal</h1>
  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The fentanyl
    trafficking ring</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The head of the trafficking ring, the “kingpin”, was a man named Raymond
    Goudreau. The two other higher-ups were Grenville Sinclair and his girlfriend
    at the time, Julie Baks. Baks was employed as a medical secretary to Dr. Alain
    Sacksen, who ran a medical clinic in Barrie. Baks’ employment was key to the
    operation of the trafficking ring.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Their operation, a rather sophisticated scheme, worked as follows.
    Goudreau would give personal information about an individual to Sinclair. The
    personal information would include the name, date of birth, health card number,
    telephone number and address of the individual. Sinclair would give the
    information to Baks. Baks would use the information to create a fake patient
    file and then would produce a forged prescription for fentanyl patches for the
    individual. After she produced the forged prescription she would delete the
    patient file. Baks would then give the forged prescriptions to Sinclair, who in
    turn would give them to Goudreau. He would provide them to the fake patients,
    who would go to the pharmacies and obtain the fentanyl patches (in a couple
    instances, Sinclair gave the forged prescriptions directly to the fake
    patients). The patches were then given to Sinclair, or to Goudreau, who
    trafficked them in North Bay, where a patch could be sold for between $400 and
    $450.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the police raided Goudreau’s operation, Baks had created 19 fake
    patient files, of which Loor was one, and had produced forged prescriptions for
    900 fentanyl patches.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next two sections of this narrative set out in summary form the
    circumstantial evidence supporting the trial judge’s finding of guilt.</p>
  <h6>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Loor obtains 45 fentanyl
    patches </h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2013, Baks opened a computer file for a fake patient named Yancy
    Loor. She inputted Loor’s health card number, birthdate, address and telephone
    number. Baks then created a prescription for Loor for 45 transdermal fentanyl
    patches at the highest available strength, 100 micrograms per hour. Baks forged
    Dr. Sacksen’s signature on the prescription. The prescription contained the
    same personal information on Loor as in the patient file. After creating the
    forged prescription, Baks deleted the patient file in Loor’s name.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly afterwards, Yancy Loor went to the Express Aid IDA Pharmacy in
    Barrie and tendered the prescription to one of the pharmacists, Jamil Rashid.
    Because Loor had never filled a prescription at the pharmacy before, Rashid did
    three things. First, he called Dr. Sacksen’s office to verify the prescription.
    Baks told him that the prescription was correct. Second, as required by
    provincial legislation, Rashid verified Loor’s identity. He did so by comparing
    the photo on the health card Loor had produced for identification with the
    person standing in front of him. Rashid was satisfied that the person at the
    pharmacy was the same person whose photo was on the health card. Third, as a
    further check, Rashid handwrote Loor’s health card number, which was the same
    as the number in the patient file at Dr. Sacksen’s office and on the forged
    prescription.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rashid then dispensed 15 patches to Loor, the first of three
    installments, at a cost of $228.93. Rashid did not, however, make a copy of
    Loor’s health card.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 1, 2013 a different pharmacist dispensed the second
    installment of 15 patches of fentanyl. She had no independent recollection of
    doing so but was adamant that when dispensing narcotics her practice was to
    check identification unless she knew the person, and she did not know Loor. The
    pharmacy’s prescription record showed that 15 patches were dispensed to a man
    named Yancy Loor with the identical personal information and health card number
    as on the original prescription.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 3, 2013 Rashid dispensed the last installment of 15 fentanyl
    patches to a person with the same personal information and health card number
    as Yancy Loor.</p>
  <h6>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Loor is located and
    arrested</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the police arrested Goudreau they obtained his cellphones, which
    contained contact lists. One of Goudreau’s contacts was “Yanz” with a telephone
    number the same as the number on Loor’s deleted patient file at Dr. Sacksen’s
    office and on the prescription records from the pharmacy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A police officer named Justin Ford called the number and when a male
    voice answered he asked “Yancy”? The male responded “yeah”. Ford then asked “Yancy
    Loor”? Again, the male responded “yeah”. Ford identified himself as a police
    officer from the street crime unit. The male said he would get his lawyer to
    call him back. Ford gave the male his police-issued cellphone number. A lawyer
    named Craig Bottomley called Ford on behalf of his client Yancy Loor.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loor was arrested at the Central North Correctional Centre, where he was
    in custody on another matter. On arrest he identified himself as Yancy Loor,
    and asked to speak to his lawyer, Craig Bottomley.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From among Loor’s property at the jail, Ford found Loor’s health card, which
    by this time had expired. The card had the same number and date of birth as in
    Dr. Sacksen’s patient file and the IDA Pharmacy records. In Ford’s lay opinion
    the photo on the heath card was a photo of Loor.</p>
  <h6>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Discussion</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because Loor was convicted on circumstantial evidence of identity, two
    legal standards come into play on this appeal: the standard to convict where
    the evidence of identification is solely or primarily circumstantial; and the
    standard of appellate review of the reasonableness of a verdict based on
    circumstantial evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In recent decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada has emphasised that no
    particular form of words is required to express the standard for a conviction
    based on circumstantial evidence. Even ordinary proof beyond a reasonable doubt
    language is acceptable. See for example <em>R. v. Griffin</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2009 SCC 28, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, at
    para. 33; and <em>R. v. Villaroman</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at paras. 17-22.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But in <em>Villaroman</em>, Cromwell J. favoured language that focuses
    on inference drawing because that language alerts the trier of fact to the
    danger of coming to an unwarranted or speculative conclusion. The standard may
    thus be expressed as follows: in a case where the sole or primary evidence of
    identification is circumstantial, in order to convict, the trier of fact must
    be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the accused is the
    only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, where the Crown’s case at trial depended on circumstantial
    evidence, to uphold the reasonableness of the verdict, an appellate court must
    be satisfied that the trier of fact acting judicially could reasonably be
    satisfied that the accused’s guilt was the only reasonable conclusion available
    on the totality of the evidence: see <em>Villaroman</em> at para. 55. But
    Cromwell J. also added at para. 71: “[T]hat it is fundamentally for the trier
    of fact to draw the line … that separates reasonable doubt from speculation.”
    An appellate court is justified in interfering only if the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the evidence excluded any reasonable alternative to guilt was
    itself unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the trial judge was well aware that the evidence
    against Loor was entirely circumstantial. She recognized that neither
    pharmacist could identify Loor as the person who came to their pharmacy to get
    the prescription for 45 fentanyl patches filled. The pharmacy did not have
    video surveillance available. And Rashid did not make a copy of the health card
    presented to him to identify the person asking to have the prescription filled.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also understood the standard for convicting on the basis
    of circumstantial evidence of identity. After an exhaustive review of that
    evidence, she considered and rejected the possibility of any reasonable
    inference from the evidence other than guilt. She concluded: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the only rational
    inference that can be drawn from the circumstantial evidence is that the
    accused is guilty. Based on the evidence I accept, I am convinced beyond a
    reasonable doubt of Mr. Loor’s guilt. There is nothing in the evidence or the
    lack of evidence that I have heard that causes a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, Loor submits that the circumstantial evidence of identification
    was insufficient to prove his guilt and that the trial judge failed to consider
    the possibility that another person, even another person within the trafficking
    ring, could have impersonated Loor, with false identification, to obtain the fentanyl
    patches. I do not agree with either branch of Loor’s submission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reasonably concluded that no reasonable inference other
    than guilt was available on the evidence. She also properly rejected, at least
    implicitly in the passage from her reasons quoted above, the suggestion that
    Goudreau or Sinclair or some other person used a fraudulent health card with
    Loor’s personal information on it to obtain the fentanyl patches. That
    possibility was nothing more than mere speculation or conjecture. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following pieces of circumstantial evidence especially show that the
    only reasonable inference from the evidence was that Yancy Loor went to the IDA
    Pharmacy on three occasions and, using a forged prescription, obtained 45
    patches of fentanyl:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='
line-height:115%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rashid testified that the photo on the health card in Loor’s name
    tendered for identification was the photo of the person who obtained the fentanyl
    patches. The trial judge was entitled to accept Rashid’s evidence;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='
line-height:115%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The health card tendered to Rashid had the same number as the
    health card Ford later seized from Loor’s property;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='
line-height:115%'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rashid’s evidence and the practice of the pharmacists, which the
    trial judge accepted, show that the same person went to the pharmacy all three

    the same number on Loor’s patient file and on the prescription. And when Ford

  <p class=CQuote>I find it beyond the bounds of coincidence that the same named

    individual and phone number are linked through the officer’s call some ten

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge sentenced Loor to 6 years less 18 months credit for
    pre-sentence custody. Loor submits that his sentence was excessive,
    disproportionate to his role in the drug trafficking ring, and inconsistent
    with the sentences imposed on Baks and Sinclair. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. Sentencing judges have wide latitude in fashioning a fit
    sentence, and the sentences they impose attract significant deference from an
    appellate court. We may interfere only if the sentence is demonstrably unfit or
    the sentencing judge commits an error of law or principle that has an impact on
    the sentence: see <em>R. v. Lacasse</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge committed no error in principle and the sentence
    she imposed was fit. She recognized that Loor’s sentence must be proportionate
    to the seriousness of his crimes and his moral blameworthiness, and that the
    principles of specific and general deterrence and denunciation are important
    principles in sentencing drug traffickers. She took into account the
    aggravating considerations that might tend to increase Loor’s sentence, and the
    mitigating considerations that might tend to reduce it. Finally, she fairly
    reconciled the sentence she imposed on Loor with the sentences for Baks and
    Sinclair.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Lacasse</em> at para. 12, Wagner J. for the majority wrote that
    “proportionality is the cardinal principle that must guide appellate courts in
    considering the fitness of a sentence imposed on an offender.” Proportionality
    means that the sentence imposed depends on the gravity of the crime and its
    consequences and on the offender’s degree of responsibility or moral blameworthiness. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unless used for therapeutic purposes, under proper medical supervision,
    fentanyl is a highly dangerous drug. Its widespread abuse, though recent, has
    quickly become entrenched in our country. Every day in our communities, fentanyl
    abuse claims the lives of Canadians.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the sentencing hearing, the Crown filed affidavit evidence from Dr.
    Karen Woodall, a toxicologist at the Centre of Forensic Sciences, as well as
    the transcript of her evidence from another case. The purpose of her evidence
    was to show the dangers of fentanyl abuse and the serious consequences of fentanyl
    trafficking. Dr. Woodall has studied the effects of fentanyl and has
    co-authored two articles on fentanyl abuse – one on the oral abuse of fentanyl patches
    and another on fentanyl-related deaths in Ontario. The following is a summary
    of her evidence.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of Karen Woodall</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fentanyl, like heroin, is an opioid. Opioids are drugs that act on the
    central nervous system to relieve pain. Unlike heroin, which is illegal, fentanyl
    is a prescription drug, which can be obtained legally for therapeutic use.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therapeutically, fentanyl is used for the management of moderate to
    severe chronic pain. Patches are an effective way to administer fentanyl
    because they are applied to the skin and provide a patient with continuous pain
    relief for up to three days. But fentanyl is a very powerful drug, according to
    Dr. Woodall, up to 100 times more powerful than morphine and 20 times more
    powerful than heroin. Because it is so potent, fentanyl is only prescribed in a
    patch under strict medical supervision and to those who are “opioid tolerant”,
    that is to those who have been taking opioids for a long time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because fentanyl is so potent it becomes a very dangerous drug when it
    is not used for therapeutic reasons under medical supervision. Those who have a
    prescription for it and yet abuse it, or those without a prescription who buy a
    patch on the street or borrow one from a friend are at risk of toxicity and
    death. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effects of fentanyl are why people abuse it. Fentanyl gives people a
    high, a feeling of well-being, of euphoria. Those who use it for a long time may
    become addicted. But because fentanyl depresses the central nervous system, it can
    slow down the way one’s brain functions, decrease one’s heart rate, and slow
    down one’s breathing. A person who takes enough fentanyl may eventually stop
    breathing and die.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When abused, fentanyl patches are especially dangerous. People can abuse
    a fentanyl patch in many different ways. They can inject the patch contents
    intravenously, cut up the contents and chew small portions at a time, inhale
    it, smoke it, and even make tea with it. What makes the patch particularly dangerous
    is the medication’s location within the patch. The medication is in a matrix,
    essentially buried inside the patch. To get the medication out of the patch a
    person has to chop it up or melt it down or heat it up. But then the person
    will not know how much fentanyl has been released. Its potency for an
    individual is thus often unpredictable. And so, Dr. Woodall concludes, a lot of
    deaths have been associated with the abuse of fentanyl patches.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The gravity of Loor’s crimes</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loor trafficked in 45 patches of fentanyl, as the trial judge found a
    “not insignificant amount” of this dangerous drug, worth somewhere between $18,000
    and $20,000 on the street in North Bay. In addition, by using a forged
    prescription Loor planned and carried out a fraud on the pharmacy. His crimes
    and their consequences were serious.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loor was 39 years old when he committed these offences. He must accept a
    fair measure of responsibility for his role. Although he was a low-level member
    of Goudreau’s trafficking ring, his role was necessary to the successful
    operation of the scheme. He and the others that went to the pharmacies were
    needed to obtain the fentanyl patches. And in carrying out his role he must
    accept responsibility for deceiving the IDA Pharmacy and two of its pharmacists.
    He was unable to prove that he was an addict trafficker, which might have
    served to reduce his moral blameworthiness. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Baks and Sinclair were higher-ups in the trafficking ring. Each played a
    key role in the scheme. Baks trafficked 900 fentanyl patches, 20 times more than
    did Loor. Sinclair likely trafficked a similar amount. After pleading guilty
    Baks was initially sentenced to nine years on a joint submission, but on
    appeal, her sentence was reduced to six years, the same as Loor’s sentence: see <i>R. v. Baks</i>, 2015 ONCA 560. Sinclair, too, was initially sentenced to
    nine years after pleading guilty, but on appeal his sentence was reduced to
    eight years: see <i>R. v. Sinclair</i>, 2016 ONCA 683. Yet there is no
    inconsistency in the sentences imposed by this court on Baks and Sinclair and
    the sentence imposed by the trial judge on Loor. Each of them is understandable.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court reduced Sinclair’s sentence from nine years to eight years

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of these mitigating considerations that reduced the sentences for
    Baks and Sinclair apply to Loor. A six year sentence for Loor is not
    demonstrably unfit or out of line with the sentences imposed on Baks and
    Sinclair.</p>
  <h6>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Conclusion</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Loor has failed to demonstrate that his sentence was unfit or reflected
    any error in principle. The Crown invited us to establish a range for fentanyl
    trafficking, while acknowledging that sentencing is a “highly individualized
    exercise” and that the relevant considerations affecting a sentence will vary
    from individual to individual: see <em>Lacasse</em> at para. 58. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Few fentanyl trafficking cases have reached this court. It is thus
    perhaps too early in our jurisprudence to establish a range. But I think it
    fair to say that generally, offenders – even first offenders – who traffic significant
    amounts of fentanyl should expect to receive significant penitentiary sentences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
