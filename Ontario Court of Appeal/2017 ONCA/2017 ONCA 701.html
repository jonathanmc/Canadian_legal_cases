  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice D. A. Broad of the Superior
    Court of Justice at Kitchener, Ontario, dated December 20, 2016, with reasons
    reported at 2016 ONSC 7911.</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom><strong>van Rensburg J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A husband and wife dispute property ownership following marriage
    breakdown. The parties were married in 1974. They separated in 2011 after 37
    years of marriage. There were four children of the marriage who are independent
    adults. The husband, who had worked in the computer industry, stopped working
    after losing his job in 1994. The wife worked full-time until 1978, after which
    she had some part-time work as a piano teacher. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The main issue in the matrimonial proceedings is how to
    characterize the more than $1.3 million in investments derived from money the
    husband’s parents provided during the parties’ marriage. The disputed funds constituted
    the bulk of the parties’ assets. Some of the disputed funds were used to
    purchase two successive matrimonial homes. The larger part was invested and the
    income generated was used to pay the majority of the family’s expenses. Some of
    the investments were in the husband’s name, some were in the wife’s name, and others
    were in the husband and wife’s names jointly. Some accounts were in the joint
    names of one or both of the parties and one or more of their children.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> On or about the time of separation, and without the wife’s consent, the husband
    transferred more than $1 million of the investments to his mother or to
    accounts maintained by him with his mother or other family members <span
lang=EN-US>(in some cases after forging the wife’s signature).</span> The husband
    contends that this occurred after the wife withdrew $32,000 from a jointly-held
    investment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband argues that all the disputed investments were held in
    resulting trust for his parents or were loans that must be repaid to his mother
    (since his father is deceased). The wife argues that all of the advances were
    gifts to both parties and that there was no expectation of repayment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On summary judgment the husband was ordered to pay the wife the sum of <span
lang=EN-US>$592,308 in equalization, as well as spousal support arrears and pre-judgment
    interest. The wife was also granted a charge over the former matrimonial home
    to secure payment of the equalization amount. The motion judge dismissed both
    parties’ claims for ongoing or lump sum spousal support. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband’s appeal challenges the following: (1) the suitability of
    summary judgment; (2) the striking of portions of his affidavit dated August
    11, 2016; (3) the counting of dissipated assets and double counting; (4) the characterization
    of the investment monies; and (5) the appropriateness of granting security
    against the former matrimonial home.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decision of the motion judge</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence before the motion judge consisted of affidavits of the
    parties and the affidavit of Lillian Chao, the husband’s mother. The wife
    brought the summary judgment motion after the litigation had been outstanding
    for four years. The wife had filed a net family property statement, which she
    amended. The husband had made some financial disclosure, including in an
    affidavit of documents, but had not produced a net family property statement.
    Orders had been made against the husband compelling further financial
    disclosure as well as answers to undertakings and refusals on his questioning. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The wife moved to strike certain paragraphs of one of the husband’s affidavits
    in which he sought to “correct errors” in the wife’s net family property
    statement respecting the investment accounts. This was argued as a preliminary
    matter and addressed in the motion judge’s summary judgment reasons. The motion
    judge struck some, but not all, of the impugned paragraphs, on the basis that
    the husband had failed to provide full and complete disclosure of relevant
    documents as required by the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, O. Reg. 114/99, as
    amended.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In dealing with the property issues, after setting out the relevant
    legal principles, the motion judge endorsed the idea that the same factors and
    principles could be used to determine whether advances made by a parent were
    subject to a resulting trust or were loan advances. That is, he framed the
    issue as “whether the parent intended to retain a hold on the amounts advanced”
    (at para. 77). He then considered the following facts as relevant:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    husband managed the investments without any consultation with his parents;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    parties declared the associated interest and capital gains for income tax
    purposes;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    were no contemporaneous documents evidencing a loan or any other hold on the
    amounts advanced by the husband’s parents;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    was no evidence of any statement or representation characterizing the advances
    at any time prior to separation;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    was no demand for return of capital or income by Lillian Chao until after the
    separation;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    demand for repayment was triggered by the wife withdrawing funds following
    separation;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    was no evidence of any partial repayment at any time prior to separation;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>none
    of the income or capital gains earned on the investments was paid to the
    parents;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>9.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>there
    was no evidence of the parents’ inquiring about the investments;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>10.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the monies were
    advanced by the husband’s parents to help the parties out; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2>11. the
    amounts comprising the sum of $99,582, which the husband characterized as an
    outstanding loan, had been advanced long ago and there was no evidence of any
    realistic expectation of repayment on the part of Lillian Chao. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that there were no issues of credibility
    requiring a trial since there was no real disagreement between the parties
    about “what anyone said or did in relation to the advances and the investments.”
    Rather, the disagreement between the parties related to their subjective
    beliefs and assumptions, which were largely irrelevant and did not require a
    trial to resolve (at para. 82).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the presumption of resulting trust in favour
    of Lillian Chao had been rebutted. The various advances made by the husband’s
    parents could not be characterized as held in resulting trust for the parents, or
    loans.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also found that the monies from the husband’s parents that went into
    the matrimonial homes, even if the advances were made to the husband, would in
    any event have lost their status as excluded assets under s. 4(2)(5) of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>,<em> </em><span lang=EN-US>R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that, contrary to the wife’s claim, the husband
    no longer had any beneficial interest in a property in Waterloo, accepting the
    husband’s evidence that he had transferred his interest to his children who,
    over time, had transferred their interests back to their paternal grandmother. With
    respect to the husband’s silver and gold interests, the motion judge accepted
    the silver had been gifted to the parties equally and was not satisfied that
    the gold was still in existence and in the possession of the husband. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge ordered the husband to pay the wife the sum of <span
lang=EN-US>$592,308 in equalization, spousal support arrears of $27,680, and pre-judgment
    interest totalling $34,795.28. He also granted the wife security over the former
    matrimonial home to secure payment of the equalization sum pursuant to s.
    9(1)(b) of the </span><em>Family Law Act</em><span lang=EN-US>. The motion
    judge dismissed the parties’ claims for ongoing and lump sum spousal support. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 16(6) of the <em>Family Law Rules</em> provides that, on a summary

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The moving party bears the onus of showing there is no genuine issue requiring

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The husband makes three related arguments disputing
    the appropriateness of summary judgment in this case. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the husband argues that a decision should
    not have been made without Lillian Chao’s oral testimony, since her rights were
    affected by the judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lillian Chao swore an affidavit dated March 7,
    2013 that was appended as an exhibit to the husband’s affidavit. The affidavit
    asserts continuing ownership of the monies given to the parties. Lillian Chao says
    that she and her husband provided monies for the purchase price of both matrimonial
    homes on the understanding that when the house was sold they would receive half
    of the proceeds. She also says that during 1986-1988 and from 1994 until the
    parties’ separation, she and her husband supported the parties’ living expenses
    by having the husband manage their investments and by gifting only the
    dividends, capital gains and interest to the husband. As evidence of a
    continuing interest in the monies, she asserts that she and her husband
    continued to include the investment income on the disputed funds in calculating
    the 10% of their annual income that they donated to charity. Her affidavit also
    states she and her husband made loans totalling $99,582.40 to the parties,
    which remain outstanding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The husband asserts that the judgment effectively
    (if not legally) extinguishes Lillian Chao’s entitlement to repayment of the
    disputed funds. While Lillian Chao as a non-party is not bound by the judgment
    and can still pursue a claim (a position endorsed by the wife on appeal), given
    his mother’s advanced age, it would be practically difficult for her to proceed
    with a claim. He also asserts that an independent claim by his mother would be
    inconsistent with the overall purpose of summary judgment, which is to reduce,
    and not to promote, litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this argument. The
    summary judgment procedure was invoked by the wife at a time when all of the
    evidence she had been able to marshal about the investments was available, and
    when it was apparent that the husband would not provide any further disclosure.
    The wife’s position was that the investments belonged to the parties, and not
    to the husband’s parents, who had made advances as gifts to the family without
    expectation of repayment. The husband and mother’s position was to the contrary,
    and it was up to them to ensure that her position was before the court, and to
    join her as a party to the extent her interests were implicated.</span></p>

    litigation cannot determine the suitability of summary judgment. While it may
    well have been preferable for Lillian Chao to have been a party to the
    proceeding, on a summary judgment motion, the court must decide the claims
    presented in the litigation on the evidence before it. The fact that the
    husband chose to put Lillian Chao’s position before the court by affidavit
    without seeking to join her as a party, was not a basis for refusing summary
    judgment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The husband’s second and related argument is
    that summary judgment should not have been granted without requiring oral
    evidence from Lillian Chao either under r. 16(6.2) or in a directed trial. He
    argued that her affidavit did not provide complete information. However, the husband
    did not ask for his mother to provide oral evidence at the summary judgment
    motion. Instead he asserted, before the motion judge and on appeal, that his
    mother would be willing to attend </span><em>at a trial</em><span lang=EN-US> to provide a complete account of the various advances that were made.</span></p>

    Davis</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2015 ONCA 726, [2015] O.J. No. 5630 at para. 27. The
    husband cannot succeed on summary judgment by saying that further or better
    evidence would be available in the future. The motion judge was entitled to
    assume, as he did at para. 83 of his reasons, that the evidence before him was
    the best evidence available. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>There is no real disagreement between the
    parties, or between the applicant and Lillian Chao, on what anyone said or did

    irrelevant. A trial is not necessary to resolve the dispute about the parties’
    subjective beliefs and assumptions.</span></p>

    interest in the monies. Rather, he concluded that the </span><em>objective</em> <span lang=EN-US>evidence – the absence of any contemporaneous documents
    evidencing a loan, of any specified manner of repayment, of any security held
    for the loan, of any partial repayment, of any demand for payment prior to

    valuation date, they were not caught by his disclosure obligations. He also

    expected the court to accept this evidence. Further, the husband’s health
    concerns did not excuse his failure to produce the relevant documents. His
    affidavit asserts that he spent “many hours” verifying the wife’s lists of the
    investments and identifying “errors”. The order striking paragraphs from his

    that went into the parties’ matrimonial homes early in the marriage, even if
    advanced to the husband alone, lost their status as excluded assets under s.

    however depend on how they were received and then how they were invested. In
    this case some of the investment accounts were in the husband’s name, some were
    in the wife’s name, and the majority were in the parties’ names jointly. As
    this court held in </span><em>Townshend v. Townshend</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    2012 ONCA 868, 113 O.R. (3d) 321, at paras. 32-33, it is not the case that all
    gift monies lose their excluded character when deposited into a joint account
    with a spouse. In </span><em>Townshend</em><span lang=EN-US>, the court allowed
    the husband an exclusion for one half of the monies deposited into a joint account
    where he received the monies as a third party gift.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the motion judge’s reasons in this case are
    read as a whole, however, his finding that the monies were gifted to the
    husband and wife jointly is implicit. It is on this basis that he brought into
    equalization the entirety of the investment accounts and ordered the husband to
    pay the wife the sum of $592,308. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would also note that the payment the motion
    judge required the husband to make “in respect of equalization under sections 5
    and 7 of the </span><em>Family Law Act</em><span lang=EN-US>” primarily
    reflects the return of monies he determined were already owned by the wife. In
    her amended net family property statement dated August 26, 2016, the wife
    attributed to the husband the full value of monies in which she at the same
    time asserted an ownership interest. This was likely to reflect the fact that
    those monies were no longer in the wife’s possession. The nature of her
    entitlement to the monies in which she had an ownership interest at the valuation
    date, however, is as part-owner rather than as the recipient of an equalization
    payment arising from marriage breakdown. </span></p>

    the value of the matrimonial home and consented to an order dated January 22,
    2016, transferring the wife’s interest in the home to the husband for $390,000.
    The motion judge ordered a charge on the former matrimonial home, now fully
    owned by the husband, as security for payments he owed to her under the judgment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The husband says that the January 2016 consent
    order prohibits the charge. This is because the consent order provides that “[n]either
    party shall make any further claim with respect to the former matrimonial home
    once the property is transferred.” </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to this argument. Properly
    interpreted, the consent order prohibits any further claims of the wife for an
    interest in the matrimonial home, since she has received one half of its value
    as agreed between the parties. However, the charge is not in respect of a claim
    to the property, but rather secures “the performance of an obligation imposed
    by the order” against property that now belongs to the husband: </span><em>Family
