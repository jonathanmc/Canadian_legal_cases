  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>This appeal
    involves the application of the involuntary admission provisions of the <em>Mental
    Health Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7 (“MHA”) to an incarcerated offender.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>In 2005, as the
    appellant completed a penitentiary sentence, a psychiatrist formed reasonable grounds
    to believe that the appellant suffered from certain mental disorders (i.e. paraphilia,
    severe personality disorder, psychotic symptoms) that would likely result in
    serious bodily harm to another person. The appellant was sent to a psychiatric hospital,
    where two different psychiatrists assessed him and formed the same opinion
    about the presence of mental disorders and the risk of harm to others. Despite
    numerous reviews by the Consent and Capacity Board (“the Board”), the appellant
    remains detained in a psychiatric hospital. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The Board last
    reviewed the appellant’s status as an involuntary patient at a hearing on March
    14, 2013. The appellant’s appeal from that decision was dismissed. He now appeals
    to this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The appellant
    argues that the Board’s decision was unreasonable and that the appeal judge
    erred in not setting it aside. The appellant contends that he does not have a mental
    disorder and that the MHA is being used to effectively extend his prison
    sentence indefinitely, in breach of ss. 7, 9, 11(h), and 12 of the <em>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</em> He seeks an order for his immediate
    release under s. 24(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>I would dismiss
    the appeal. In short, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that his
    detention under the MHA in 2005 was motivated by any invidious purpose. In the
    ensuing years, the Board has confirmed that he has an untreated mental disorder
    that requires his detention. The appellant has done virtually nothing to
    address these issues, leading to the Board’s last decision, confirming his
    detention once again. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>I agree with the
    appeal judge that the Board’s decision to confirm the appellant’s involuntary
    status was reasonable and free from legal error. I also agree with her
    conclusion that, because the appellant has failed to demonstrate that his
    detention (both initial and continued) runs afoul of the MHA, his <em>Charter</em> claims must fail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Before
    considering these issues in more detail, it is necessary to examine the
    appellant’s criminal and psychiatric history, along with the somewhat
    complicated procedural history of this case.</span></p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>the facts</span></h1>

    57 years old. He is dangerous. This is clear from his lengthy criminal history.
    He has committed many violent offences, including sexual offences against women
    and children. His dangerousness has been confirmed by numerous psychiatric
    assessments over the years. Since 1990, he has spent most of his time detained,
    either as a sentenced criminal, or as an involuntary patient in a psychiatric
    facility.</span></p>

    appellant was serving an aggregate 14-year prison sentence for armed robbery, sexual
    assaults, and gross indecency. He served his sentence at Kingston Penitentiary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    appellant’s sentence came to an end, an application for psychiatric assessment
    (Form 1) was issued under the MHA. On September 3, 1999, the appellant was
    transferred to the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre (Oak Ridge Division),
    now called Waypoint Centre for Mental Health (“Waypoint”). He was assessed at
    that hospital and admitted as an involuntary patient (Form 3).</span></p>

    2000, the appellant was discharged from Waypoint directly into police custody.
    He was charged with sexual assault, assault, choking, forcible confinement, and
    extortion, all against his former female partner. The charges dated back to
    1990. After a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of common assault only,
    contrary to s. 266 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    initiate dangerous offender proceedings under Part XXIV of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. Indeed, it would have been unable to do so. The dangerous offender
    provisions are triggered by the commission of a “serious personal injury
    offence” that carries a maximum sentence of at least 10 years’ imprisonment: see
    s. 752. The maximum sentence for assault is five years’ imprisonment: see s.
    266(a).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The trial judge
    sentenced the appellant to five years’ imprisonment (less pre-sentence custody):
    see <em>R. v. Nelson </em>(12 June 2001), Sault Ste. Marie, 5963/A0 (Ont. S.C.).
    In his reasons, at p. 140, the trial judge emphasized the severity of the
    appellant’s offence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In terms of common assault or assault simpliciter, this is the
    worst case of common assault that I have heard or I am aware of.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Regarding the worst offender, we look at the background of Mr.
    Nelson. He has a criminal record of 31 convictions between 1976 and 1991. Nine
    of the convictions are for crimes of violence, including armed robbery, assault
    and sexual assaults.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The trial
    judge referred to the appellant’s psychiatric assessments and concluded that he
    was at a “very high risk to reoffend involving crimes of violence” (at p. 140). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The Crown appealed
    the appellant’s acquittals; the appellant appealed his sentence. Both appeals
    were dismissed: see <em>R. v. Nelson</em>, [2003] O.J. No. 163 (C.A.). In
    dismissing the sentence appeal, this court affirmed, at paras. 1-2, that the
    facts of the appellant’s case brought it into the category of the most serious
    simple assault and that the appellant qualified as the worst offender.</span></p>

    giving rise to this appeal occurred as the appellant’s five-year sentence ended.
    On March 4, 2005, Dr. James Hillen, a psychiatrist at the Regional Treatment
    Centre of Kingston Penitentiary, completed an application for psychiatric
    assessment (Form 1). The appellant was transferred to Waypoint on March 10,
    2005. This Form 1 is at the core of the appellant’s grounds of appeal. He argues
    that it was used to maintain his custody, and for no legitimate mental health
    purpose. </span></p>

    extent, Dr. Hillen’s reasons for completing the Form 1 can be evinced from an Institutional
    Consult Letter (“Consult Letter”) he wrote at the time. The document is dated
    February 24, 2005; however, in it, Dr. Hillen describes events up to March 4,
    2005.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The Consult
    Letter indicates that attempts were made to assess the appellant in 2001 and
    2003. However, it states that on both occasions the appellant refused to participate
    in psychological assessments. The document does not indicate who attempted to
    assess the appellant, and for what purpose.</span></p>

    2005, Dr. Hillen reviewed 18 years of the appellant’s psychiatric and
    psychological records, as well as other records from the Parole Board of Canada
    and Corrections Canada. Dr. Hillen attempted to meet with the appellant on
    February 24, 2005, but the appellant refused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the appellant’s female parole officer. She reported that the appellant had recently
    asked her if he could get a condom so they could have sex in her office, and
    told her that he thought a condom machine had been placed on the unit for this
    purpose. The officer considered the incident to be “fear-provoking” and
    suggestive of delusions (i.e. ideas of reference and erotomanic delusions).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    nurse attempted to meet with appellant on March 4, 2005. The appellant refused

    The appellant’s counsel advised the Board that he wished to create a record in

    children. He was troubled by the appellant’s lack of insight into his
    paraphilias and the wrongfulness of his actions. Dr. Livermore detailed certain
    behavioural problems exhibited by the appellant while hospitalized, including inappropriate
    behaviour towards female staff as recently as the year preceding the hearing
    before the Board. Dr. Livermore described the appellant’s steadfast refusal to cooperate
    with treatment options recommended for him with a view to reducing his risk and
    paving the way towards fewer restrictions on his liberty, including his
    possible release into the community under supervision. In particular, Dr.
    Livermore was of the opinion that the appellant’s failure to agree to take sex-drive
    reducing medication (Lupron) was highly problematic. The appellant had taken
    this medication for a short period of time in the past, but then refused to
    continue with it. Dr. Livermore concluded that, because of his untreated mental
    disorders, the appellant poses a high risk to others if released into the

    of a nature and quality that would likely result in serious bodily harm to
    others unless he remained hospitalized. The Board reviewed the appellant’s past
    criminal behaviour and how his conditions prevent him from understanding the
    wrongfulness of his actions and its impact on others. The Board relied on the
    following example, at p. 9:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>He was convicted of assaulting his then girlfriend’s young
    daughter, on at least ten (10) occasions and left her with venereal warts in
    her vagina and has admitted to assaulting other young girls. He could not
    understand why his girlfriend would not have him back after that event and was

    or menacing towards females. The Board observed, at p. 10:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>He is narcissistic and distorts reality…. [H]e is unable to
    appreciate his past acts were wrong or his fault. He sees himself as a victim
    of the justice system and does not and cannot take any ownership for any of his
    past or current actions, behaviours or statements. He is unable to see that
    others see them differently. He further has no insight as to their [e]ffect on

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>RN has a score of 37 out of a possible 40 on

    indicates sexual deviance with a preference for nonsexual violence over
    consenting adult heterosexual activity, a sexual preference for violent sexual
    activities against male and female children and coercive sexual activities
    against male children over consenting adult homosexual activities. At
    Brockville, further actuarial testing by way of the Static 2002R, which is
    designed to predict sexual and violent recidivism, place RN in the

    the task of hearing the witnesses and assessing evidence. Absent demonstrated
    unreasonableness, there is no basis for judicial interference with findings of
    fact or the inferences drawn from the facts. This means that the Board's
    conclusion must be upheld provided it was among the range of conclusions that

    Most often these cases involve disorders that produce psychotic symptoms. Conversely,
    the MHA is not concerned with blame or censuring an individual for past

  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>One of the safeguards is the requirement

    with an application based only on third-party evidence. There needs to be
    direct contact between the doctor and the patient in order for the doctor to

    be applicable in the myriad of circumstances that confront physicians called
    upon to make the serious decision to involuntarily commit persons to a
    psychiatric facility. “Examination”, in this context, must mean observing the
    person, reviewing the patient’s chart (if there is one), reviewing the available
    history and the collateral information, and where possible (in the sense that
    the person complies) and necessary (in the sense that the information to be

    analysis in <em>Mullins</em> is helpful. The appeal judge applied the approach from
    that case and concluded that Dr. Hillen complied with the requirements of s.
    15(1): </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>On the evidence available, Dr. Hillen
    performed most of the requirements identified in&nbsp;</span><em>Mullins&nbsp;</em><span
lang=EN-GB>in that he reviewed the appellant’s chart, history, and collateral
    information from an individual who had direct contact with the appellant. It
    was not possible to interview him due to his lack of cooperation.&nbsp;It was
    not necessary to do so, given that information about his psychiatric health was
    available elsewhere.&nbsp;Further given the nature of the appellant’s Axis I
    and Axis II disorders as described by Dr. Hillen in the Institutional Consult
    Letter, one must question whether it would have been possible to obtain
    accurate and reliable information directly from the appellant.&nbsp;Finally, in
    terms of directly observing the appellant, this is a case where the patient’s
    circumstances must dictate the extent to which such personal observation is
    necessary.&nbsp;The contextual approach referenced in&nbsp;</span><em>Mullins</em><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><em>Everson</em><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;is
    needed.&nbsp; Specifically, one must question how likely it is that the
    appellant would have been likely to engage in the predatory, opportunistic,
    forceful, persistent, and fear-provoking type of coercive behavior that
    characterized his sex-offending behavior, in Dr. Hillen’s presence.</span></p>

    these conclusions. Section 15 of the MHA is designed to address mental
    disorders that compromise the safety of the patient or the public at large. The
    scheme cannot be so easily defeated by the simple failure of an individual to
    participate in the assessment process. The record indicates that the appellant
    refused to cooperate with psychiatric assessments in 2001, 2003 and in 2005. As
    Reid J. noted in the passage quote above, there may be factors, such as a mental
    disorder itself, that prevent individuals from having meaningful interactions
    with a physician acting under s. 15. In these circumstances, physicians may
    need to undertake other measures to evaluate a patient. That is what occurred
    here. In the face of the appellant’s obstinance, Dr. Hillen was thorough in his
    inquiries and careful in his analysis. He relied upon virtually all information
    that was available in relation to the appellant, both old and new. </span></p>

    Hillen on the day the Form 1 was executed. As noted in para. 20 above, Dr.
    Hillen confronted the appellant with information from his parole officer, which
    the appellant denied. The appellant further denied having any mental health
    problems in the past. All of this contributed to Dr. Hillen’s ultimate
    conclusion that the appellant met the criteria for an application for psychiatric
    assessment (Form 1) under s. 15 of the MHA.</span></p>

    Starnaman was a pedophile with a lengthy criminal record. While incarcerated, prison

    clippings and pictures of children, as well as pieces of paper with the names,
    ages and addresses of single mothers and their children in the Kingston and
    Toronto areas. Approximately 8 to 9 months later, a psychiatrist completed a
    Form 1, leading to Starnaman’s transfer and involuntary admission to a
    psychiatric facility. The Board confirmed his involuntary status. His appeal to
    the Ontario Court of Justice (General Division) was dismissed: see <em>Starnaman

    Starnaman’s further appeal, this court observed that neither the Board nor the
    appeal judge were concerned with whether s. 15 of the MHA had been complied
    with; instead, both were focused on whether the criteria for involuntary
    admission in ss. 20 and 39 were met. Moreover, the court stated at p. 705:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Second, assuming that a “triggering” event
    during the period of incarceration was necessary, it is our view that the
    discovery, in the appellant's cell, of the material referred to above,
    considered in light of his particular sexual deviancy and his prior&nbsp;</span><em>modus
    operandi</em><span lang=EN-GB>, amounted to a “triggering&nbsp;event”. In
    rejecting this ground of appeal, we specifically refrain from deciding whether
    a s. 15 application can be made in circumstances where the conduct prior to
    incarceration provides the only basis for the application.</span></p>

    appeal judge recognized that <em>Starnaman</em> is inconclusive on the
    requirement for a triggering event. Nevertheless, she rejected this ground of
    appeal. Referring to the appellant’s comments to his parole officer, the appeal
    judge held, at para. 123:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>However, if such a triggering event is
    required, the events as relayed by the appellant’s parole officer to Dr.
    Hillen, as outlined in Dr. Hillen’s Institutional Consult Letter, would be
    sufficient. In my view, the events illustrate the extent to which the
    appellant’s illnesses cause him to be unable to appreciate the social
    inappropriateness of his conduct, conduct which has repeatedly throughout his
    life crossed the line into criminality.</span></p>

    that the wording of s. 15 of the MHA does not prevent a physician from completing
    a Form 1 in the absence of a triggering event. The temporal requirements of the

  <p class=CQuote>All three principles — arbitrariness, overbreadth, and gross

    objective of the law, not with the law’s effectiveness. That is, they do not
    look to how well the law achieves its object, or to how much of the population
    the law benefits. They do not consider ancillary benefits to the general
    population.  Furthermore, none of the principles measure the percentage of the
    population that is negatively impacted. The analysis is qualitative, not
    quantitative.  The question under s. 7 is whether <em>anyone’s</em> life,
    liberty or security of the person has been denied by a law that is inherently
    bad; a grossly disproportionate, overbroad, or arbitrary effect on one person

    fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute,
    along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance
    of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions….” This purpose
    is achieved through the various objectives of sentencing, including
    denunciation, deterrence and rehabilitation. It is sometimes necessary to
    achieve these goals with sanctions of indefinite incarceration or long-term
    supervision: see <em>Criminal Code</em>, Part XXIV. These are true punitive or
    penal measures.</span></p>

    authorized by the <em>Criminal Code</em> is punitive in nature. For example,
    persons found not criminally responsible or unfit to stand trial may be
    detained for lengthy periods of time. However, there is no punitive or penal
    purpose associated with detention on either of these two bases: see <em>Winko
    v. B.C. (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at paras.
    30, 40-43; and <em>R. v. Demers</em>, 2004 SCC 46, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 489, at

    Detention in a hospital is sometimes necessary for this purpose. However, it

  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>I agree with the Attorney General that to

    assumptions about mental health and violence. </span><span class=Underline>Its
    dual purpose of promoting health and public safety</span><span lang=EN-GB> is
    achieved through a carefully balanced scheme that requires a highly specific

    through detention does not imbue the latter with a punitive or penal purpose.
    This overlap does not engage s. 11(h). Moreover, as the trial judge found, it has
    not been established that the MHA was used for punitive or penal purposes

    The record demonstrates that the appellant has had many formal hearings before

lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>I accept that it is
    unrealistic to think that the appellant’s diagnoses will ever change. However,
    the existence of a mental disorder is only one of the conditions for
    involuntary commitment under the MHA. Another key element is the impact of the disorder
    on a person’s risk to himself or herself, and others. Except for a brief period
    of time when the appellant took Lupron, he has done very little to address his
    risk to others. As noted above, at para. 29, Dr. Livermore has evaluated the
    appellant with a view to the possibility of lowering his level of security and,
    perhaps, releasing him into the community. However, this will not occur until
    the appellant cooperates with, and shows progress from, the treatment plan that
    his attending psychiatrist has developed to make his risk manageable in the
    community. As Klowak J. stated in </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;

line-height:200%'>, at p. 555, “[a]lthough this man can, theoretically, be
    detained indefinitely unless he voluntarily agrees to treatment, his own
    control of that treatment gives him a large measure of control over the timing
    of his own eventual release.” The appellant stands in a similar position.</span></p>
