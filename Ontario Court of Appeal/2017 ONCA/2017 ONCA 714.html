    without a jury, with reasons reported at 2015 ONSC 7494.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Huscroft J.A.:</p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual interference, invitation to sexual
    touching, and sexual assault against a minor pursuant to ss. 151, 152, and 271
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, respectively. The trial
    judge stayed the sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching counts
    pursuant to <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Kienapple v. R.</span></em>,
    [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. <span style='line-height:200%'>The</span> appellant was
    sentenced to 20 months’ imprisonment followed by 2 years’ probation for sexual
    interference. He appeals his conviction only.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The offences were committed against the
    complainant, the daughter of D.D., when she was between the ages of three and
    five-years old. The appellant was </span>approximately 40 years <span
style='line-height:200%'>old</span> when he committed these offences. He was in
    a conjugal relationship with the complainant’s mother, D.D., and had moved into
    her apartment. The appellant often looked after the complainant while D.D. was
    at work. The <span style='line-height:200%'>offences involved</span> the
    appellant <span style='line-height:200%'>having the complainant masturbate his
    penis until he ejaculated</span>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified at trial and categorically denied the
    allegations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The</span> trial judge found that the
    appellant “testified in a straightforward manner, that he was not evasive and
    did not exaggerate, embellish or colour his evidence”, and that he “withstood
    cross-examination without a blemish.” However, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s
    evidence in its entirety and found the appellant guilty beyond a reasonable
    doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises two grounds of appeal. First, he submits that the
    trial judge failed to resolve a critical inconsistency in the complainant’s
    evidence and failed to explain why he accepted the complainant’s evidence and
    rejected the appellant’s. This ground was the focus of the appellant’s
    submissions during oral argument. Second, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge failed to consider innocent explanations for the complainant’s knowledge
    of a penis and sexual acts in determining whether a reasonable doubt arose.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would dismiss the</span> appeal for the
    reasons that follow.</p>
  <h2><span style='line-height:200%'>THE
    EVIDENCE AT TRIAL</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown tendered two video statements and called two witnesses: the
    complainant and her mother, D.D. The first video statement was recorded by D.D.
    on her cell phone at home shortly after the complainant first disclosed the
    allegations against the appellant to her. The second video statement was <span
style='line-height:200%'>an interview recorded by </span>the police several
    days later. Both video statements were admitted on consent under s. 715.1 of
    the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Criminal Code</span></em>. The
    complainant adopted and affirmed the truth of her video statements at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the statement recorded by D.D., the complainant explained that she
    “shook [the appellant’s] bird, then white stuff came out.” The complainant said
    that she did not take off her pants, but that the appellant took off his pants
    and underpants and told her to shake his “bird”. She demonstrated by holding
    D.D.’s index and middle fingers and shaking them. The complainant said that the
    appellant made her do this three times. The video also shows the complainant <span
style='line-height:200%'>using a bubble blowing wand and a toy unicorn to demonstrate
    to D.D.</span> what the appellant made her do<span style='line-height:200%'>. </span>She
    also used a white stuffed poodle to represent the “white stuff” coming out of
    the bubble wand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant made similar allegations in the video statement recorded
    by the police. She used a stuffed bear to represent the appellant and a pen to
    represent his “bird”. She shook the police officer’s finger to demonstrate how
    she shook the appellant’s “bird”. She said that “white stuff came out” and
    again said that this happened three times. She said that she remained clothed
    and that the appellant did not touch her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her testimony at trial, the complainant described the appellant’s “bird” as
    “white …just like a tree something that has a – like a mushroom stem. … like a
    mushroom stem and then it had like a puffy thing around it.” In response to a
    question from the trial judge, she said that there was a “little triangle” at
    the top of the “stem” with a hole. The complainant also drew a picture of the
    appellant’s penis ejaculating.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that the appellant told her to come to D.D.’s room and
    that he was on the bed while she stood on the floor. The complainant testified
    that “white stuff” came from the appellant’s “bird” that looked like “milk or
    cream” and that the appellant pulled his pants up after the white stuff came
    out. The complainant stated that she washed her hands in the kitchen because
    the white stuff was all over them. She described the temperature of the white
    stuff as “cold”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that she had never seen the appellant and D.D. “wrestling”
    on the bed with their clothes off. She did not think she had seen a “bird” on
    television or in a movie, but in cross-examination she testified that she
    thought she had seen a “bird” in a movie she watched at home. She stated that the
    “bird” in the movie did not look like the appellant’s, that no one shook it,
    and that no “white stuff” came out of it. The complainant testified, further, that
    she watched the movie “Seed of Chucky” with D.D. and the appellant during one
    of the regular movie nights<span style='line-height:200%'> they had.</span> In
    that movie, a doll is depicted masturbating (without a penis being shown) and
    holding a cup of white fluid. Another doll is seen holding a turkey baster with
    white fluid in it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    re-examination, the complainant testified that she was not allowed to watch any
    parts of movies in which people were naked and that D.D. would put a pillow
    over her or cover her eyes so she could not see the television.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.D.
    testified that the complainant and the appellant “were like best friends.” She
    confirmed that the complainant had seen the Seed of Chucky movie and some
    horror <span style='line-height:200%'>movies</span>, but said that they did not
    show male anatomy. D.D. stated that she did not let the complainant watch
    nudity in movies and would cover her eyes with a pillow or her hands.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.D.
    testified that the complainant entered her bedroom on one occasion when she and
    the appellant were naked and having sex. The appellant was on top of her but they
    covered up quickly with a blanket and the complainant did not really see
    anything. She did not know how long the complainant was in her bedroom before
    she observed her, but said that she remained for three to five seconds. D.D.
    testified<span style='line-height:200%'> </span>that the appellant’s penis was
    not exposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified and categorically denied all the allegations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he had a great relationship with the complainant. He
    confirmed that they watched the Seed of Chucky movie and some other horror
    movies. He said that D.D. covered the complainant’s eyes during nude scenes in
    some cases, but there were times that she did not.</p>

    appellant testified that the complainant entered the bedroom he shared with
    D.D. on at least three occasions. On the first occasion, the complainant
    observed the appellant and D.D. naked and having sex in the “doggie-style”
    position for an unknown period of time. He believed that she saw his erect
    penis for “maybe a second” on this occasion. On the second occasion, the
    complainant entered their bedroom and walked straight to the bed. The appellant
    testified that he and D.D. were completely covered and the complainant had no
    opportunity to see his penis. On the third occasion, the complainant walked
    into the bedroom while they were having sex, with D.D. on her back and the
    appellant on top of her. He could not recall whether they were covered at the
    time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.D.
    testified that the complainant disclosed the sexual abuse allegations against
    the appellant to her spontaneously. The complainant said that she had seen the
    appellant’s “bird” and that he had chased her around the apartment and tried to
    put it in her mouth (the “oral sex allegation”). D.D. testified that she began
    video recording her daughter on her cellphone after this initial disclosure.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span

    complainant did not repeat the oral sex allegation in her mother’s cell phone recording,
    the interview she gave to the police, or her testimony. On the contrary, in
    cross-examination she testified that the appellant never tried to put his “bird”
    in her mouth and that she never told her mother that he had tried to do so. The
    complainant gave the following evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q:      Okay
    and [the appellant] never chased you around the house with his bird?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A:      No.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q:      No.

    everything that the complainant said to her prior to making the video. Defence

  <h1>The trial judge’s reasons</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     Hearsay ruling</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that D.D. did not begin her cell phone recording until the
    complainant <span style='line-height:200%'>had </span>made certain <span
style='line-height:200%'>utterances. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    recognized that the hearsay statements made by the complainant to D.D. were presumptively
    inadmissible. However, in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>R. v. Khan</span></em>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, the Supreme Court held that hearsay statements that fall outside
    recognized exceptions may nevertheless be admissible if they meet the threshold
    criteria of reliability and reasonable necessity. The trial judge also relied
    on this court’s decision in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Khan v. College
    of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</span></em> (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 641 at
    657 (C.A.), in which Doherty J.A. explained:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[If a] tribunal is satisfied that
    despite the <em>viva voce</em> evidence of the child, it is still ‘reasonably
    necessary’ to admit the out-of-court statement in order to obtain an accurate
    and frank rendition of the child’s version of the relevant events, then the
    necessity criterion set down in <em>Khan</em> is satisfied. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s analysis of the admissibility issue is set out in this brief passage:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The unrecorded statements of [the
    complainant] to her mother are all part of a spontaneous and unsolicited free
    flow of thought by her, that is to say the child. The statement she made the
    following day was again initiated entirely by her and intended to clarify a
    certain matter, namely the amount of “white stuff” which she said she had
    actually encountered during the represented episodes with the accused and her
    size comparison of the penis of the accused. Nothing she said in these
    statements at issue raised with me a concern of reliability.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Her age and the sensitive nature
    of the evidence in my view meet the test of reasonable necessity. I find that
    the probative value of this evidence outweighs any prejudice to the accused. On
    a threshold basis, these statements will be admitted.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     Reasons for
    conviction</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reminded himself that his verdict was not to be based on a choice
    between the evidence of the accused and the evidence of the Crown. He also
    acknowledged the <span style='line-height:200%'>need to be guided</span> by the <span style='line-height:200%'>three-part test set out </span>in <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>R. v W.(D.)</span></em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742<span
style='line-height:200%'>. He also</span> reminded himself not to apply adult
    tests for credibility to the evidence of the child complainant<span
style='line-height:200%'>,</span> in accordance with <i>R. v. B.(G</i>.<i>)</i>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30 and <i>R. v. W.(R.)</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge neither explicitly accepted nor rejected the appellant’s testimony.
    At para. 22 of his reasons he stated only that he accepted defence counsel’s
    submission that the appellant “testified in a straightforward manner, that he
    was not evasive and did not exaggerate, embellish or colour his evidence”, and
    that he “withstood cross-examination without a blemish”. The trial judge noted
    that there was no corroboration of the allegations, but he recognized that none
    was required.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge acknowledged that the complainant gave some contradictory evidence.
    He referred specifically to the discrepancy in her description of the “white
    stuff”, which she described as being both warm and cold. The trial judge also
    considered the complainant’s conflicting evidence as to whether she had ever
    seen a “bird” on television or in a movie<span style='line-height:200%'>. He
    found that the evidence that she had seen the accused’s penis while he was
    naked in bed with D.D. or while he was in the shower, and that her description
    of “white stuff” came from the imagination of a child having watched the movie
    “Seed of Chucky”, did not rise above the level of a possibility</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The </span>trial judge found that the complainant’s initial
    disclosure of the sexual abuse was unprompted and spontaneous. The complainant
    told D.D. that she had seen the appellants “bird” and that he had chased her
    around the apartment and tried to put it in her mouth. The trial judge found
    that this disclosure prompted D.D. to begin recording what the complainant was
    saying and demonstrating on her cell phone, albeit that the precise timing of
    when the cell phone recording began was unclear.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted that the complainant gave a detailed description of the
    sexual abuse, demonstrating what had occurred using her stuffed toys. She said
    that she remained on the floor, fully clothed, while the appellant lay on the
    bed. She stated that he did not touch her. She described the ejaculation as
    “mouse drops” that she washed from her hands with soap. <span style='line-height:
200%'>She</span> demonstrated the act of male masturbation with hand gestures. She
    clarified to her mother that the volume of “white stuff” that came from the
    accused was less in volume than the stuffed poodle that she had used to
    demonstrate. She provided a detailed description of a penis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that these pieces of evidence were genuine and truthful and accepted
    the entirety of her evidence. He added that the complainant had enjoyed the
    appellant’s company and got along with him like good friends. Given such a
    relationship, it was difficult to accept that the complainant would manufacture
    a story without substance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded, at para. 28: “On the basis of the very particulars of
    the evidence [the complainant] gave as I just recounted and considering all of
    the evidence, including the denial by the accused, I am satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt the Crown has proved its case.”</p>
  <h1>ANALYSIS</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>     The first ground
    of appeal</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><em>Did the trial judge fail to
    resolve a critical inconsistency and fail to explain why he accepted the
    complainant’s evidence and rejected the appellant’s?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that the
    hearsay statement made prior to the video recording made by D.D. – that the
    appellant had tried to put his “bird” into the complainant’s mouth and chased
    her around the apartment – was a very different allegation than the one the
    appellant was convicted of committing. The appellant characterizes this as a
    critical inconsistency that the trial judge neither acknowledged nor resolved
    when assessing the complainant’s credibility. The appellant submits that the
    trial judge “does not appear to have harboured any doubt that this statement
    was made”, and notes that the allegation that the appellant attempted to put
    his penis into the complainant’s mouth was entirely unsubstantiated; it was
    denied at trial by the complainant as well as the appellant. In these
    circumstances, it was essential for the trial judge to determine “how one
    statement could bear the entire weight of the conviction while the other was,
    it appears, false”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The Crown takes the position that the
    inconsistency was not significant in the context of the trial. The evidence did
    not come from the complainant herself; it came from the complainant’s mother,
    D.D., and defence counsel did not cross-examine her on the statement. Moreover,
    the statement was never adopted by the complainant. On the contrary, in
    cross-examination she testified that she did not make the statement to D.D. and
    that the incident did not happen. The inconsistency was not mentioned by either
    counsel as a factual issue that had to be resolved, and it was not necessary
    for the trial judge to resolve it. The appellant’s convictions all related to
    the masturbation incidents, not to attempted oral sex, and it is reasonable to
    infer that the trial judge did not find that attempted oral sex had occurred,
    and that the issue “did not have to be explicitly taken into account in
    assessing the complainant’s credibility, because it was no longer in play after
    her cross-examination”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles that govern this ground of appeal are not in doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge’s credibility findings are owed significant deference on
    appeal. They should not be interfered with unless<span style='color:#212121'> they “cannot be supported on any </span>reasonable view of the evidence”: <em>R.
    v. P.(R.)</em>, <span class=cosearchterm><span style='line-height:200%'>2012</span></span><span

style='line-height:200%'>R. v. Burke</span></em>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at para.
    7.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    significant testimonial inconsistencies should be addressed because, as the
    Supreme Court noted in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>R. v. Gagnon</span></em>,
    2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 621, at para. 21, the accused is entitled to know
    “why the trial judge is left with no reasonable doubt”. However, a trial judge
    is not required to refer to or resolve every inconsistency raised by the
    defence in the course of his or her reasons: <em>R. v. R.(C.)</em>, 2010 ONCA
    176, 260 O.A.C. 52,<span style='color:#212121'> at para. 48.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    an appellate court should not interfere with a trial judge’s findings of
    credibility if the core of the complainant’s allegations against an appellant
    remain largely intact on a review of the entirety of the evidence: <em>R. v.
    Roy</em>, 2017 ONCA 30, at para. 14; <em>R. v. Barua</em><i>, </i>2014 ONCA 34,
    315 O.A.C. 83, at paras. 7-8; and <em>R. v. Marleau</em><i> </i>(2005), 197
    O.A.C. 29 (C.A.), at para. 7.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    these principles, I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A reading of the record as a whole
    demonstrates that the inconsistency was not a live issue at trial. Not only did
    the<b> </b>complainant never adopt the oral sex allegation attributed to her by
    D.D., she rejected it clearly when it was put to her. She testified that the
    appellant never chased her or attempted to put his “bird” in her mouth, and
    that she never told D.D. that he had done so. D.D. was not cross-examined on
    the statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Neither the Crown nor defence
    counsel submitted that the oral sex allegation was an inconsistency that needed
    to be resolved by the trial judge. This is not surprising, as the oral sex
    allegation statement was unrelated to the allegations of masturbation that
    formed the basis for the charges against the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, defence counsel addressed the oral sex allegation only briefly in the
    course of his closing submissions as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As well, and I appreciate children are young and their memories
    change, there are other discrepancies between what [the complainant] testified
    to in what she told her mother and I – I'm sure your honour has noted those
    inconsistencies about saying, “No, he never chased me. No, he never tried to
    stick it in my mouth” contrary to what she's alleged to have told her mother at
    the first disclosure …  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plainly,
    the oral sex allegation inconsistency identified by defence counsel was simply
    one issue amongst others. It was not a significant inconsistency that had to be
    resolved by the trial judge in making his credibility findings.<span
style='line-height:200%'> Defence counsel did not take the position that it was
    the sort of major inconsistency that appeal counsel now submits it to be.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the trial judge’s reasons are read as a whole, <span
style='line-height:200%'>it is reasonable to infer that although he accepted
    that the complainant made the statement to D.D., he did not find that attempted
    oral sex occurred. His</span> reference to the oral sex allegation at the
    outset of his decision demonstrates that he used <span style='line-height:200%'>it
    as narrative of</span> how the complainant’s <span style='line-height:200%'>allegations
    against the appellant</span> came to light and the spontaneous nature of her
    disclosure to D.D. <span style='line-height:200%'>He accepted that the
    complainant “spontaneously blurted out” the statement to her mother that last
    year she had “seen [the appellant’s] bird, that he tried to put it in her
    mouth, and that he [then] chased her around the apartment.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This was a credibility case, and
    at the end of the day the core of the complainant’s allegations were unaffected
    by the inconsistency. They remained consistent throughout. The complainant
    provided graphic details as to how the assaults took place. The trial judge
    reviewed the evidence, cognizant of the shortcomings of the child complainant’s
    evidence, and ultimately decided to accept her evidence in its entirety. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge’s analysis

  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has shown no basis that would allow this court to interfere with the
    trial judge’s decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.                 “Grant Huscroft J.A.”</p>

  </p>
  <p class=Judgedissentingconcurring>Trotter J.A. (dissenting):</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have had the benefit of reading the carefully prepared reasons of my colleague,
    Huscroft J.A. I agree with how he would dispose of the second ground of appeal.
    However, I respectfully disagree with his conclusion on the first, concerning
    the complainant’s prior inconsistent statement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    believe the inconsistency is significant. Given the trial judge’s very positive
    findings about the appellant’s presentation as a witness, his failure to
    address the complainant’s inconsistent statement constitutes a reversible error
    that requires a new trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague has recounted the underlying facts comprehensively. I need not repeat
    them. However, I would characterize certain trial events somewhat differently.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    inconsistent statement at issue was the complainant’s very first disclosure of
    her allegations. But it was never repeated – not in the iPhone video; not in
    her other statements to D.D.; not to the police; and not at trial. In her trial
    testimony, the complainant denied that the appellant chased her around the
    apartment and tried to put his penis in her mouth. Moreover, she even denied
    making the statement to D.D.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the complainant testified, the Crown (not Ms. Young) applied to have this
    statement (and others) admitted for its truth, based on <em>R. v. Khan</em>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531. The appellant resisted the application. The trial judge
    admitted the evidence on this basis, finding threshold reliability had been
    established. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the Crown attempts to downplay the significance of the inconsistent
    statement. Ms. Young emphasizes that the evidence did not come from the
    complainant herself; instead, it arose during D.D.’s testimony. She also
    observes that the complainant never adopted this statement in
    cross-examination, and in fact denied that the incident happened. Consequently,
    the Crown submits that the inconsistency cannot “fairly be laid at the
    complainant’s feet, particularly since it was not explored with her mother…in
    cross-examination.” I disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    can be no doubt that the complainant’s initial statement to D.D. was a prior
    inconsistent statement. It was proved through D.D. that, on an earlier
    occasion, the complainant said something different from her in-court testimony.
    Far from suggesting that the complainant did not make this statement, the Crown
    succeeded in having it admitted for its truth. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    potential impact on credibility of such a statement is clear, even when the
    witness denies making it: see <em>R. v. Mannion</em>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 272, at
    pp. 277-278. In<i> <em>R. v. M. (A.)</em></i>, 2014 ONCA 769, 123 O.R. (2d)
    536, this court allowed an appeal from convictions for sexual offences. The
    appeal focused on the adequacy of the trial judge’s reasons in light of
    frailties in the evidence, including prior inconsistent statements of the
    complainant. As the court said, at para. 12:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-GB>Fourth, one of the most valuable means of
    assessing witness credibility is to examine the consistency between what the
    witness said in the witness box and what she has said on other occasions,
    whether or not under oath</span></u><span lang=EN-GB>:&nbsp;<i>R. v. G. (M.)</i>&nbsp;(1994),
    93 C.C.C. (3d) 347&nbsp;(Ont. C.A.), at p. 354, leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused,&nbsp;(1995), [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 390&nbsp;(S.C.C.). <u>Inconsistencies
    may emerge in a witness' testimony at trial, or between their trial testimony
    and statements previously given.</u> Inconsistencies may also emerge from
    things said differently at different times, <u>or from omitting to refer to
    certain events at one time while referring to them on other occasions</u>. [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The complainant’s failure to adopt her previous
    statement, and her denial of having made it, did not mitigate its impeachment
    value, as the Crown seems to suggest. A witness need not admit to having made a
    previous statement before it can be used for impeachment purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Although the complainant did not adopt her previous
    statement, it nevertheless became admissible for its truth when the Crown
    succeeded on its </span><em>Khan</em><span lang=EN-GB> application. The Crown
    vouched for its reliability at that stage, and again during closing
    submissions. It cannot now retreat from this position because the statement
    turned out to have impeachment value as a prior inconsistent statement. This
    should have been obvious when the </span><em>Khan</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-GB>application
    was made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Moreover, the Crown’s criticism of defence
    counsel’s (not Mr. Krongold) failure to explore the issue in his
    cross-examination of D.D. is misplaced. Defence counsel had D.D. confirm that
    the complainant repeated the statement “a couple of times.” It was entirely
    appropriate for counsel to leave well enough alone and rely on the
    inconsistency; he was not obliged to assist in resolving it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I respectfully disagree with my colleague’s
    conclusion at para. 48, above, that the inconsistency “was not a live issue at
    trial.” The appellant testified about the statement. He acknowledged playfully
    chasing the complainant around the apartment “all the time”, but denied trying
    to put his penis in her mouth. Moreover, defence counsel referred to this
    inconsistency in his closing submissions (see the excerpt in para. 50, above).
    While it may not have been defence counsel’s primary focus, the issue was
    squarely in play. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I accept that trial judges are not required to
    address every inconsistency that arises on the record. However, this leeway has
    limits. I return to </span><em>M. (A.)</em>,<span lang=EN-GB> in which the
    court addressed this issue, at para. 14: </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>As the Supreme Court stated in&nbsp;</span><em>R.
    v. Dinardo</em><span lang=EN-GB>, at paras. 26-27, the failure to articulate
    how credibility concerns are resolved, particularly in the face of significant
    inconsistencies in a complainant's testimony, may constitute reversible error,
    as an accused is entitled to know why the trial judge is left with no
    reasonable doubt.</span></p>

    16.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge said that the complainant “gave some contradictory
    evidence.” However, he failed to specifically evaluate the prior inconsistent
    statement, one that he found provisionally reliable when admitting it on the
    basis of <em>Khan</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge placed great emphasis on the fact that, given the positive
    relationship that the complainant admitted to having with the appellant, it was
    unlikely that she would fabricate the allegations against him. However, he
    never explicitly rejected the appellant’s evidence. I repeat the trial judge’s
    general appraisal of the appellant’s evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I accept the submission of [defence counsel] that the accused
    testified in a straight forward manner, was not evasive and did not exaggerate,
    embellish or colour his evidence. <u>He withstood cross-examination without a
    blemish.</u> Essentially his position is that the incidents related by [the
    complainant] with which he is charged did not occur. There is no evidence to
    corroborate the allegation, but of course, none is required. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the complainant’s inconsistent statement was so at odds with the rest of her
    evidence, it could not be ignored. After all, the statement was admitted for
    its truth. In these circumstances, and as a witness who “withstood
    cross-examination without a blemish”, the appellant was entitled to know why
    the complainant’s evidence was capable of establishing his guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
