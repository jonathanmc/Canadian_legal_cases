    the interest awarded on general damages ought to have been the sum of

    of speculation that the jury had used age 64. To ensure that the respondent’s

    four scenarios. For the first three scenarios, the respondent’s accounting
    expert (from Price Waterhouse Coopers and later of KPMG), Mr. Rehman, took
    figures from Statistics Canada. The first scenario was based on sales
    statistics for unincorporated businesses. The second was based on 2006 figures
    for truck drivers, including tow truck drivers. The third was based on 2006 figures
    for higher-ranking positions in the same industry, specifically for supervisors
    of motor transport and other ground transit operators, on the assumption that
    the respondent likely would have obtained a promotion at some point. The fourth
    scenario was based on data collected by the Economic Research Institute (ERI)
    about tow truck operators in the area where the respondent worked. Within those
    four scenarios presented to the jury, two - and only two - retirement dates
    were proposed: age 64 and age 67.</span></p>

    the trial, Mr. Hamzeh, a friend of the respondent and the respondent’s
    colleague at the time of the accident, gave evidence. The two had worked for
    the same towing company and had planned to go into business together and
    operate their own towing company. Unfortunately, this motor vehicle accident
    intervened and the respondent was unable to participate in those plans any
    further. Mr. Hamzeh, however, did go into business for himself and gave
    evidence about his business income and expenses from his business over the years.
    The respondent’s expert, Mr. Rehman, was in court for that evidence and, based
    on what he had heard and on reviewing the financial records for Mr. Hamzeh, as
    well as his income tax records, he was able to come up with a fifth and a sixth
    scenario, based on those records and statistical averages for the respondent,
    for past (prior to trial) income and for future (after trial) income losses.</span></p>

    company” scenario, was the average retirement age 67. In all of the other three

    calculations. He was not asked to demonstrate for the jury how they might use
    the present value numbers if they did not accept the proposed retirement dates.
    Finally, the respondent was never asked any questions at all about when he
    expected to retire. On this record, it was a misapprehension of evidence to
    suggest that this jury might have based their award for future loss of income
    on a retirement date other than those specifically referenced in the evidence.

    the year during which the respondent would reach age 65. In my view she erred
    in doing so and she should have instructed the jury to award damages based on

    reason was that the relevant assignment provision, s. 267.8(12)(a)(v) of the <i>Insurance

    that the ODBP provides. According to the trial judge, the problem was that

    not be obligated to make any payment to the respondent beyond the age of 65 in
    relation to drugs, the liability insurer, who has or may have been required to
    compensate the respondent on this head beyond the age of 65 by reason of the
    erroneous charge, will receive no corresponding reduction by way of assignment
    or trust. Accordingly, in this case, the plaintiff may have been overcompensated

    sheet. Accordingly, the verdict sheet did not require the jury to specify
    awards for future care costs under the sub-headings that she had proposed, such
    as separate headings for each of physiotherapy, psychology, etc., instead of a
    single one for “Future Professional Services”, and separate headings for
    medications and for assistive devices instead of a single one for “Future
    Medication &amp; Assistive Devices”. At paras. 5 and 6 of her reasons, she
    concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[5]<b> </b>  As a result of the jury's global awards of $424,550
    for Future Professional Services, and $82,429 for Future Medication and
    Assistive Devices, the Defendants are now unable to meet their onus to
    demonstrate that the jury award compensated the Plaintiff for the same loss in
    respect of which the Defendants now claim an assignment of benefits.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[6]<b> </b>  The case law concerning the trust and assignment
    provisions of the <i>Insurance Act</i> requires me to ensure the prevention of
    double recovery by a plaintiff. This requirement must be balanced against a plaintiff's
    entitlement to receive full compensation; that is, by not being subjected
    unfairly to deductions based on uncertainty and speculation. I adopt the
    reasoning of Leach, J. in <i>Gilbert v. South</i>, 2014 ONSC 3485, 120 O.R.
    (3d) 703, at para. 9 where she found herself similarly bound by the very strict
    onus of proof applied to defendants in these cases:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>However, concern to ensure mandated prevention of such
    double-recovery is balanced by concern that a plaintiff should receive full
    compensation and not recover less than that to which he or she is entitled;
    i.e., by being subjected unfairly to deductions based on collateral benefit
    entitlements that are in doubt and/or which may not truly overlap with sums
    recovered in a tort judgment. Statutory provisions of this nature therefore are
    strictly interpreted and applied. In particular: deductions from a plaintiff's
    damage award to prevent double recovery will be made only if it is absolutely
    clear that the plaintiff's entitlement to such collateral benefits is certain, <i>and</i> that the plaintiff received compensation for the same benefits in the tort
    judgment, (as &quot;apples should be deducted from apples, and oranges from
    oranges&quot;). Evidence of &quot;likelihood&quot; and &quot;probability&quot;
    in that regard is not enough to warrant a deduction. Rather, a &quot;very
    strict onus of proof&quot; applies in relation to such matters, and it must be
    &quot;patently clear&quot; that the preconditions for an appropriate deduction
    have been established. If there is uncertainty as to a plaintiff's receipt of
    such benefits, the value of the benefits entitlement, and/or the extent (if
    any) to which recovered tort damages relate to the same type of expense covered
    by the benefits received, matters are not &quot;beyond dispute&quot; in the
    sense required for a deduction, and no deduction should be made. See <i>Chrappa
    v. Ohm</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 651 (C.A.), at p.657; <i>Bannon v. Hagerman
    Estate</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 659 (C.A.), at p.679; <i>Cowles v. Balac</i>,

    (C.A.), this court addressed the standard of proof that this subsection
    required. At issue was the treatment of the plaintiff’s ongoing entitlement to

    trial judge to deduct the present value of future disability payments to age
    65. The trial judge had concluded that, in order to succeed with respect to the
    deduction of future benefits, the defendants had to demonstrate that it was
    “beyond dispute” that the plaintiff qualified in every respect for these
    payments and that they would be received. She found on the facts that this was
    not established and refused to make that deduction. However, to avoid the
    prospect of double recovery, the trial judge imposed a “</span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Cox and Carter</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>” order, requiring the

    655-56, 657 and 658:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>What then must be shown to demonstrate entitlement to those
    future payments? As I have said, the test adopted by the trial judge is that it
    must be shown to be beyond dispute that the plaintiff qualifies for these
    payments in every respect. I agree with this. The plaintiff's present right to
    receive these payments means that so far as the future can be made certain,
    they will be received. Short of that, there is no entitlement for the purposes
    of the subsection.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The subsection requires by its terms that the entitlement to
    future payments exist at the time of trial. It must be shown that there are
    future payments to which the plaintiff &quot;<i>is</i> entitled&quot; (emphasis
    added). The <i>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i> provides that to be
    entitled is to have a rightful claim to something. The plain meaning of the
    language of the subsection requires the showing of a present right to receive
    these future payments. Otherwise the present value deduction does not apply.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The relevant case-law also supports the conclusion that a

  <p class=CQuote>I therefore conclude that the appellants fail on the central
    issue in this appeal. Both parties agreed that, in this event, no quarrel can
    be had with the modified “<i>Cox and Carter</i>&quot; order imposed by the
    trial judge. It does full justice to both parties in that it provides a
    mechanism for ensuring with precision that the respondent obtains no double
    recovery because of these future payments from the respondent's insurer to
    compensate her for loss of income. It does so without passing to the respondent
    any risk that her ultimate recovery will be less than that awarded by the jury.

    can see in this context why the court required a defendant claiming the benefit

  <p class=CQuote>[44]<b> </b>  With respect, I find the reading of the statute
    advanced by the British Columbia Court of Appeal and adopted by the respondents
    problematic in several respects. First, and most importantly, it grafts onto
    the statutory sections something that is simply not there. I do not agree with
    the statement in <i>Jang</i> that &quot;[t]he requirement that the benefit
    match the claim is implicit in the legislative scheme ... and is explicit in s.
    24(2) [now s. 25(2)], which matches 'a claim for damages' with 'benefits
    respecting the claim'&quot; (para. 13) […] Since the term &quot;benefits&quot;
    is defined under s. 25(1) as &quot;includ[ing] accident insurance benefits
    similar to those described in Part 6&quot;, it follows that &quot;benefits
    respecting the claim&quot; must in this case refer to the <u>full</u> panoply
    of accident insurance benefits received under the Quebec legislation in respect
    of the death of Mr. Ross. It is, in my view, a contrived reading of the statute
    to interpret &quot;benefits respecting the claim&quot; as encompassing various
    individual heads of damage claimed under the SAAQ scheme, and to thereafter
    require that these benefits be deducted only to the extent that they
    individually overlap with elements of the tort award. In my opinion,
    &quot;benefits respecting the claim&quot; refers to the global package of
    benefits paid under the SAAQ regime in respect of Ms. Gurniak's claim for
    damages arising from Mr. Ross's death in a motor vehicle accident. There is, to
    my mind, nothing in the language of this provision that mandates that there be
    a &quot;match&quot; between the specific heads of damage in a tort award and
    the specific heads of damage under the contract or benefits scheme in question
    before a deduction is appropriately made.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[45]<b> </b>  This approach has the benefit of simplicity and
    ease of application and likely explains why British Columbia chose not to
    introduce an explicit matching requirement into the statute, when it could
    readily have done so. A trial judge, once he or she has determined that the
    benefits under the two regimes are broadly similar under s. 25(1), will deduct
    from the tort award any benefits already received in respect of the claim for
    damages arising from the motor vehicle accident. The trial judge will not be
    required to engage in a complicated and cumbersome process of
    &quot;matching&quot; a head of damage in tort to a particular claim for damages
    under a statutory scheme. This interpretation of s. 25(2) is supported by the
    fact that under some statutory schemes, the benefits received are not neatly
    classified into the various heads of damage for which they compensate, thereby
    making it nearly impossible for trial judges to give meaningful effect to any
    sort of matching principle. [Emphasis in original.]</p>

    benefits that fall generally into the “silos” created by s. 267.8 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Insurance Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'> with the tort heads of
    damage. Income awards are to be reduced only by SABs payments in respect of
    income loss and health care awards only by SABs payments in respect of health
    care expenses. The latter item is, I suggest, deliberately broad enough to
    cover all manner of expenses that relate to health care and would include
    medications, physiotherapy, psychology sessions, assistive devices and the
    like. All manner of other expenses that are covered by SABs and that do not
    fall under the income category or the health care category fall into the “other
    pecuniary losses” category. </span></p>

    questions to be posed for the jury. Neither the deductibility of benefits nor
    the assignment of benefits was meant to be complicated. See<em> Gurniak</em><em><span

    review of the jurisprudence quickly reveals the struggles trial judges have had
    in an effort to follow the “strict matching” said to be mandated by <em>Bannon</em>.

    should not be able to avoid either the deductibility or assignment of SABs
    already received or to which they will be entitled in future by the manner in

    under SABs, with claims for medication costs, which are covered, it would be

    who had testified as an actuarial expert, had recalculated the cost of future
    medications with the assumption that the Ontario Drug Benefit Program would
    fully cover the respondent’s medication costs once he reached age 65. The jury
    award appears to be more in line with Mr. Martel’s revised figures and perhaps
    with his assumption that medication costs would be covered after age 65. Even
    if one must assume that the jury awarded some portion of drug costs after age
    65 in keeping with the trial judge’s charge to treat the drug benefit program
    as a contingency, the jury’s figure is only some $4000 more than Mr. Martel’s
    lowest number. Any prejudice to the liability insurer is therefore negligible.</p>
