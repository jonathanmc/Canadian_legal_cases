  <p class=Inthematterof>IN THE MATTER OF:  Jason Murray</p>
  <p class=Namesofparty>AN APPEAL UNDER PART XX.1 OF THE <em>CODE</em></p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Jason Murray, acting in person</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Kelley Bryan, appearing as <em>amicus curiae</em> </p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Katherine Beaudoin, for the Attorney General of Ontario</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Janice Blackburn, for St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton</p>
  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard: September 8, 2017</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal against the disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board dated, September 9, 2016 and October 24, 2016.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Jason Murray, appeals from two dispositions of the
    Ontario Review Board (the “Board”): an Initial Disposition dated September 9,
    2016 and the Current Disposition dated October 24, 2016.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The index offences all occurred in January 2016: failure to comply with
    probation (6 counts); carrying a concealed weapon; and mischief under $5,000.
    On July 7, 2016 the appellant was found not criminally responsible of the index
    offences on account of mental disorder. The trial judge remanded the appellant
    to the St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton (the “Hospital”) pending disposition by
    the Board.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>In its Initial Disposition, the Board
    found the appellant suffered from a delusional disorder and was a significant
    threat to public safety. The Board ordered his detention on a general forensic
    unit of the Hospital, with privileges up to accompanied community passes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 4, 2016 the Hospital transferred the appellant to a secure
    forensic unit under the <em>Mental Health Act</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7</span></em>. On October 12, 2016 the Hospital
    asked the Board for an early full review of the Initial Disposition pursuant to
    s. 672.81(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46</span></em>, as well as a restriction of liberties hearing
    pursuant to s. 672.56(2).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board held the hearing on October 19, 2016. In its Current
    Disposition, the Board ordered the appellant detained on a secure forensic unit
    of the Hospital, with the same privileges as contained in the Initial
    Disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits the Board’s findings in both dispositions that he
    is a significant threat to the safety of the public were unreasonable. In his
    appeal of the Initial Disposition, the appellant asks this court to substitute
    an absolute discharge or a conditional discharge under which he can return to
    live in the community. In his appeal of the Current Disposition, the appellant
    seeks an absolute discharge or, alternatively, a return to the Hospital’s
    general ward with community privileges. <em>Amicus</em> submits both hearings
    were procedurally unfair and a new hearing should be directed. The respondents
    take the position both appeals should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant filed a significant amount of fresh evidence on the
    appeals. Although the respondents submit the materials do not meet the criteria
    for the admission of fresh evidence, they were content we review the materials,
    which we have done.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s next annual review is scheduled for September 22, 2017.</p>
  <p class=Heading>II.       APPEAL OF THE FIRST DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Amicus</em> argues that the Board’s first hearing was procedurally
    unfair. The appellant contends he received a fair hearing, but the Initial
    Disposition was unreasonable. The respondents submit the appeal of the Initial
    Disposition is moot.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept the respondents’ submission. The Initial Disposition is no
    longer in force; it was replaced by the Second Disposition. The appeal from the
    Initial Disposition is moot.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Amicus</em> submits that if the appeal from the Initial Disposition
    is moot, this court should exercise its discretion to hear it. We disagree. The
    appeal of the Current Disposition will provide the opportunity to consider the
    live issues between the parties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appellant’s appeal from the Initial Disposition is
    dismissed as moot.</p>
  <p class=Heading>III.      APPEAL OF THE SECOND DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Amicus</em> submits the second hearing was procedurally unfair
    because the Board placed inappropriate limits on the role of <em>amicus</em> and failed to provide adequate assistance to the appellant who was
    self-represented. <em>Amicus</em> also contends the Current Disposition
    detaining the appellant on the secure forensic ward fell outside the range of
    reasonable outcomes and was not the least onerous and restrictive disposition
    available in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant disagrees with <em>amicus</em>; he submits he received a
    fair hearing from the Board. However, he contends the Current Disposition was
    unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The fairness of the hearing</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At both hearings, counsel, Mr. Kerr, was available to act for the
    appellant. The appellant wished to represent himself and declined the
    appointment of counsel. As a result, the Board appointed Mr. Kerr as <em>amicus</em> for both dispositions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before us, <em>amicus</em>, Ms. Bryan, submits the Board fell into error
    by preventing Mr. Kerr from playing an expansive role of “acting for the
    accused.” As a result, the Hospital’s evidence was not tested seriously in any
    way, including exploring whether the appellant could be detained on a general
    unit, but with less restrictive mechanisms to manage his risk. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Amicus</em> further argues the Board failed to provide the appellant
    with the assistance required by a self-represented litigant. In particular, the
    Board failed to inquire into the appellant’s request that community living be
    included in his disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded by these submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The October 19, 2016 hearing considered evidence on two issues: (i)
    whether the appellant remained a significant threat to the safety of the
    public; and (ii) whether he should be detained on the Hospital’s general or
    secure forensic unit. The hearing understandably focused on the second issue as
    only six weeks had elapsed since the Initial Disposition, the appellant
    continued to suffer from delusional disorder, continued to have no insight into
    his mental illness, and continued to refuse treatment by medication.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two witnesses testified at the hearing: Dr. Prat, a Hospital
    psychiatrist, and the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The transcript of the hearing shows the Board recognized and discharged
    two of its important duties: (i) to ensure the unrepresented appellant
    understood the process and was able to participate to the extent necessary to
    ensure a fair hearing: <em>Runnalls (Re)</em>, 2011 ONCA 364, 106 O.R. (3d)
    291, at para. 21; and (ii) to act as an inquisitorial tribunal, searching out
    and considering not only evidence that supports restrictions on the accused but
    also evidence that supports an absolute discharge or release subject to the
    minimal necessary restraints: <em>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic
    Psychiatric Institute)</em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625, at para. 54.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Prat was questioned extensively by Board members about: how the
    appellant acted and was managed on the general unit; alternatives to
    transferring the appellant to the secure unit; the reasons for his transfer;
    his current course of treatment; and the availability of privileges. During the
    appellant’s testimony, the Chair asked a number of questions to elicit from the
    appellant his evidence about the events on which the Hospital relied to
    transfer him to a secure unit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the Hospital’s closing submissions, one Board member asked
    counsel why the Hospital was taking the position the appellant should not have
    indirect grounds privileges. The Chair asked the appellant’s attending
    psychiatrist, Dr. Ferencz, to provide a detailed answer to the member’s
    inquiry. The Chair also questioned the appellant during his closing argument in
    order to obtain a clear understanding of the disposition he proposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the inquisitorial manner in which the Board conducted the hearing,
    we are not persuaded by <em>amicus’</em> argument that the Board failed to
    provide adequate assistance to the appellant in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do we accept the submission that the Board unduly limited Mr. Kerr’s
    role as <em>amicus</em> at the hearing. The Board did not limit Mr. Kerr, as <em>amicus</em>,
    from playing the important role of presenting issues favouring the accused that
    otherwise might not be raised: <em>R. v. LePage</em>, 2006 CanLII 37775 (Ont.
    C.A.), at para. 29. At the end of the Board’s questions, the Chair asked Mr.
    Kerr whether there was “anything arising from the Board members questions.” Mr.
    Kerr responded: “No thank you.” Further, Mr. Kerr made brief closing
    submissions, arguing it was “a little questionable” about whether the Hospital
    had the grounds to transfer the appellant to a secure unit. The record
    indicates Mr. Kerr’s limited participation was more a function of the
    single-issue nature of the hearing combined with the Board’s extensive questioning
    of Dr. Prat, than any effort by the Board to limit his role as <em>amicus</em>.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The reasonableness of the Board’s Current Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits the Board should have granted him an absolute
    discharge. <em>Amicus</em> argues the detention of the appellant on the secure
    forensic unit was unreasonable because the Board failed to explore less
    restrictive dispositions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The test for review of findings of fact and determinations with respect
    to questions of mixed fact and law is reasonableness: <em>R. v. Owen</em>, 2003
    SCC 33, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 779. The Board’s finding that the appellant was a
    significant threat to the safety of the public was supported by the evidence:
    the appellant’s lack of insight into his major mental illness and his need for
    medication; his prior convictions for assault, uttering threats, and assault
    with a weapon; and the unanimous opinion of the appellant’s treatment team that
    he met the threshold for significant threat to the safety of the public, as
    explained in the Administrator’s Report to the Board.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s decision to continue the appellant’s detention on the secure
    forensic unit was reasonable and supported by the evidence of the events that
    led the Hospital to transfer him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note, however, that the Board refused the Hospital’s request to delete
    the appellant’s indirectly supervised hospital and grounds privileges. The
    Board stated: “We have considered this request and are not persuaded that Mr.
    Murray would not be able to utilize such a privilege at some point over the
    next 12 months.” As well, the Board specifically referred to the evidence of
    Dr. Ferencz that the Hospital would seek an early review if it concluded the
    appellant could be detained on the general forensic unit without compromising
    public safety. No doubt both issues will be canvassed at the appellant’s
    upcoming annual review.</p>
  <p class=Heading>IV.      THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUE</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, <em>amicus</em> submits the Board lacked jurisdiction under
    Part XX.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to review the appellant’s restriction
    of liberty because the Hospital used provisions of the <em>Mental Health Act</em> to transfer him to the secure forensic unit. However, <em>amicus</em> submits
    the Board’s lack of jurisdiction had no effect on its ultimate disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no need to address this jurisdictional argument. In its October
    12, 2016 letter to the Board, the Hospital sought a full review of the Initial
    Disposition as an early review pursuant to s. 672.81(2) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. Given that request, the Board clearly had jurisdiction under Part
    XX.1 to consider the appellant’s continued detention on the Hospital’s secure
    forensic unit.</p>
  <p class=Heading>V.       DISPOSITION </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set out above, we dismiss the appeal.</p>
