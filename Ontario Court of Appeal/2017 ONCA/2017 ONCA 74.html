  <p class=Heard>Heard: January 9, 2017</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on June 10, 2014
    and the sentence imposed on October 16, 2014 by Justice R. Dan Cornell of the Superior
    Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>ENDORSEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a successful severance application the appellant underwent two
    separate trials. On March 6, 2014 he was found guilty of sexual assault in
    relation to K.O. (see C58815), the companion appeal, and sentenced to 28 months
    imprisonment. For the reasons given we have dismissed that appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, the appellant was also found guilty of sexual assault
    and invitation to touching a person under the age of 14 for a sexual purpose.
    The sexual assault conviction was conditionally stayed on the basis of <em>R.
    v. Kienapple</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The focus of the submissions on this
    appeal is the appellant’s sentence which is four years to run consecutively to
    his 28 month sentence for the sexual assault in C58815.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was in a relationship with the complainant’s mother’s best
    friend, Krista. The complainant, who was three years old at the time, told her
    mother that on occasions when they slept over at the apartment of Krista and the
    appellant, the appellant would take the complainant into the bathroom and “pee
    in [her] mouth” at night when everyone was asleep. He would angrily tell her to
    “swallow it” which she sometimes did to make him happy. This happened on
    approximately ten occasions over a seven month period. The appellant denied the
    allegations.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conviction appeal</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the conviction appeal, the appellant relies on his factum. In it, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge’s reasons for conviction were
    insufficient because the trial judge failed to acknowledge that the claimant
    had recanted her allegations and also recanted allegations she made against
    others.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also asserts that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence by
    mischaracterizing certain issues as peripheral. This included the claimant’s
    evidence on the distance from the sofa bed to the bathroom, the appellant’s
    attire and the improbability of a sexual assault while the claimant’s mother
    was sleeping in such close proximity to the location of the assaults.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deficiency in reasons is not a free-standing ground of appeal. They must
    be so deficient as to foreclose meaningful appellate review: <em>R. v. R.E.M.</em>,
    2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 25. That is not this case. The trial
    judge’s reasons fulfilled their function of explaining why the appellant was
    convicted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The submission that the trial judge did not give consideration to the
    complainant’s recantation of her allegation of sexual assault is not borne out
    by the trial judge’s reasons. The reasons do refer to the fact that the
    complainant told her mother that she was “joking” about the sexual assault that
    allegedly took place in May 2010. The recantation took place about a week after
    the mother confronted the appellant and his girlfriend with the allegation and
    the appellant convinced the mother it was false. At trial, the mother testified
    that her three year old daughter did not understand the concept of a joke at
    that time. In August 2010, the complainant was in the back seat of a vehicle
    with her mother and step-father in front and spontaneously handed up a drawing
    of a penis. A few days later, the appellant delivered a wall unit and
    television to the complainant’s mother. Upon seeing the appellant she became frightened
    and hid behind her mother. After the appellant left, she told her mother, “I
    have to tell you something Mommy, it’s something bad.” The mother called her
    common law husband to sit down and the complainant said to them both, “It is
    not a joke, mommy, Uncle Rolly did pee in my mouth.” Following this, the
    complainant steadfastly maintained her allegation. The fact the trial judge did
    not comment further on the alleged “joke” is indicative that, insofar as he was
    concerned, the evidence of the “joke” did not have a material impact on the
    complainant’s credibility. Having regard to the context, we agree that the
    trial judge was not required to consider it further.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the statement the claimant made to the police that her stepfather
    had “flicked” her and that she had seen her father’s bum on one occasion,
    neither is an allegation in the real sense. The father was never asked about
    the “flick”; the stepfather acknowledged that when he was stepping out of the
    shower on one occasion he had dropped his towel within sight of his
    step-daughter. The fact that the complainant denied making these “allegations”
    at trial did not rise to a level of significance that required comment by the
    trial judge. Similarly, the distance to the bathroom from where the complainant
    and her mother slept was peripheral. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that when he was at home he always changed into
    a t-shirt and he either wore jeans or, since 2003, a pair of knee length purple
    shorts with white flowers on them and that he had never worn pyjamas. The
    complainant’s evidence as to the appellant’s attire was conflicting and
    inconsistent. The trial judge acknowledged the conflict in the evidence and
    that this aspect of the complainant’s evidence was unreliable. He also
    addressed a number of other problematic aspects of the complainant’s evidence
    such as the improbability of the complainant being sexually assaulted with her
    mother in close proximity. A trial judge may accept all, some or none of a
    witness’ testimony. The trial judge explained in detail why he accepted the
    complainant’s allegation against the appellant, addressed the appellant’s
    evidence and explained why he rejected it. The trial judge’s reasons are
    entitled to deference and do not disclose error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown applied successfully to have the convictions and facts found
    in C58815 admitted as similar fact evidence in this trial. The similar fact
    evidence, which the trial judge accepted, corroborated the complainant’s
    evidence, although the trial judge indicated he would have come to the same
    conclusion without it. The appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentence appeal</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We turn now to the sentence appeal. The appellant and respondent agreed
    that 1) the appellant was to be sentenced as a first offender; 2) the appellant
    had been sentenced to 28 months for the other offence; and 3) the totality
    principle applied. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s submissions on sentencing at trial were confusing. When
    defence counsel gave his submissions, he suggested to the trial judge that the
    Crown had been inconsistent, at times asking for 24-30 months consecutive, and
    at times submitting that the global sentence should be 5-6 years (which would
    be 32-40 months for the present offence). The trial judge responded:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I will call upon him again, but I asked him two or three times
    what an appropriate total sentence would be and he can correct me if I’m wrong,
    but I clearly heard him say, on no less than three occasions, five to six years
    for these remaining three charges. <span class=Underline>You have correctly
    pointed out that even on his own math, we don’t get to six years, we get to
    approximately five years, so I will work with five years.</span> That’s what
    his position is, that if there had been one trial, a conviction on all three
    charges, that the Crown would have been asking for, for arguments sake, five
    years. I put the same question to you, if this had been one trial, and your
    client had been convicted on those three counts, what is your submission as to
    the proper length of the sentence? [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The position of the defence was that an appropriate sentence was 12
    months consecutive to the 28 months already given following the appellant’s
    other trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge reviewed the factual
    background and the position of the parties. In doing so, he stated, “The Crown
    has submitted that the appropriate range of sentence in connection with both of
    the indictments that were before the Court is four to six years.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then reviewed the jurisprudence and distinguished the
    cases on which the appellant relied, reviewed the victim impact statement, the
    fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, the appropriate range of
    sentence for this type of crime, the aggravating and mitigating factors, and
    the totality principle. However, he ended up imposing a sentence of four years
    imprisonment to be served consecutive to the 28 months. This amounted to a
    global sentence of six years and four months. The defence had not been given notice
    that the trial judge intended to “jump” the Crown’s submissions and accordingly
    made no submissions on such a sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that in saying, “I will work with five years”
    during counsel’s submissions, the maximum global sentence available to the trial
    judge in the absence of notice was five years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s position on appeal is that a sentence of 24 to 30 months
    consecutive to the 28 months (which would result in a global sentence of 52-58
    months) is warranted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the trial judge’s comment did not bind him to
    five years. He submits that the trial judge was entitled to impose the sentence
    he did as the sentence only slightly exceeded the upper end of the range of six
    years the Crown mentioned.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there is disagreement between counsel on the extent to which the
    Crown’s submission as to a global sentence was exceeded, there is no question
    that the trial judge imposed a sentence that exceeded the Crown’s position. A
    trial judge’s failure to provide the parties with an opportunity to make
    further submissions in such an instance is an error in principle. Ideally, if
    the trial judge does impose a sentence in excess of the Crown’s position, the trial
    judge should explain the reason for doing so. Here he did not. See <em>R. v.
    Hagen</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>2011 ONCA
    749, at para.5; <em>R. v. Menary</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>2012 ONCA 706, 298 O.A.C. 108, at para. 3, <em>R. v. Grant</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>2016 ONCA 639, 351 O.A.C. 345,
    at paras. 164-167. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly the error in principle resulted in procedural unfairness and
    also had an impact on the sentence such that appellate intervention is justified.
    See <em>R. v. Lacasse</em> [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089. Having regard to the trial
    judge’s error in principle, this court is entitled to reassess the sentence
    imposed and to impose a fit sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. D.D. </em>(2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788 (C.A.), at para. 44,
    Moldaver J.A., as he then was,<em> </em>explained that, “as a general rule,
    when adult offenders, in a position of trust, sexually abuse innocent young
    children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial periods of time,
    they can expect to receive mid to upper single digit penitentiary terms.” In
    this case, the number of times the abuse occurred, namely, ten times, and the
    seven month period of time over which the abuse occurred in proportion to the
    little girl’s age, 36 months, is substantial. The nature of the offence was
    serious, invasive, and the degrading nature of the offence was added to by the
    appellant’s demand that she swallow his semen. Although the appellant, an adult
    of about 35 at the time, did not overtly threaten the little girl, he is a
    large man who used an angry tone towards her that was frightening. She was
    taught to refer to the appellant as “uncle” and he was in a position of trust
    towards her, albeit at the low end of the spectrum. In our opinion a fit
    sentence is a global sentence of six years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal as to
    sentence, set aside the sentence imposed and substitute a sentence of 44 months
    consecutive.</p>
