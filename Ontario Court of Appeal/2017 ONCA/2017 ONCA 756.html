  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on April 26, 2014 by
    Justice Gordon D. Lemon of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Trotter J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of multiple sexual offences against his
    girlfriend’s daughter and four of her friends. All of the victims were primary
    school girls. All of them were between 10 and 12 years old when they first
    disclosed the abuse. The victims were rarely, if ever, violated alone; offences
    were committed in the presence of some, if not all, of the others. When they
    were abused, the victims were told to remove their bottom clothing only. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by allowing the jury to
    engage in similar fact reasoning as between the victims. Specifically, he
    submits that the Crown failed to discharge its burden to prove that the
    evidence of the victims was not tainted by unintentional collusion. The
    appellant also complains that the trial judge failed to consider or
    misapprehended evidence on this issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would dismiss this appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant originally faced a 20-count indictment, involving seven
    complainants. He was acquitted on charges related to two complainants. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case has its origins in the appellant’s relationship with his former
    girlfriend and her daughter, N.M. They lived together between 2006 and 2009. Except
    for the counts involving the complainants that resulted in acquittals, N.M. was
    present when all of the offences were committed. </p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of N.M. </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>N.M. testified that the appellant sexually assaulted her when he lived
    with her mother. The appellant sexually assaulted her friend D.A. around the
    same time. N.M. said that the appellant licked and rubbed his penis on their
    vaginas; he made them put it in their mouths. The girls were asked to remove
    their bottom clothing, but not their tops. She testified about a similar
    incident in the appellant’s van with De. A. The girls masturbated the appellant
    while he touched their vaginas. Their tops remained on.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the appellant’s relationship with N.M.’s mother ended, he
    eventually moved to a different house. At the new location, the sexual abuse
    involved a number of the victims at the same time. They took turns masturbating
    the appellant and putting his penis in their mouths. Their tops remained on.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of D.A.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.A., who was 14 at the time of trial, testified that, on several
    occasions, the appellant touched her vagina with his hands, penis and mouth.
    She was told to touch his penis with her hand and to put his penis in her
    mouth. N.M. was always present when this happened. Their tops remained on the
    whole time. D.A. said the appellant threatened her if she told anyone.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of De. A.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>De. A., who was 12 at the time of her testimony at trial, also testified
    about the incident in the appellant’s van with N.M. The appellant sexually
    assaulted her on another occasion, when she was at his residence with N.M.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>De. A. testified about other incidents at the appellant’s residence that
    involved herself, N.M., M.G., and A.G. Sometimes two of them would be involved;
    at other times, four. They touched the appellant’s penis. Some of them put it
    in their mouths. De. A. testified that her top never came off during these
    incidents. She also said that the appellant threatened her.</p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of M.G. and A.G.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.G. and A.G. are sisters. The appellant rented an apartment above their
    residence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.G. was 13 at the time of trial. She described events that occurred
    with N.M., A.G. and De. A. M.G. testified that the appellant kissed them and
    had N.M. masturbate him. The appellant unsuccessfully tried to penetrate N.M.,
    A.G. and herself. M.G. said that her top never came off.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.G. was 11 at the time of the trial. She said that she went into the
    appellant’s room with N.M. and A.G. The girls were instructed to line up in
    front of the appellant. N.M. told the girls to do things involving their
    vaginas and the appellant’s penis. She said that hands and mouths were
    involved. A.G. was instructed to kiss the appellant. She touched his penis, but
    did not think that she put her mouth on it. The appellant put his penis and
    mouth near the three girls’ vaginas. A.G. testified that the appellant took her
    pants off in the line-up. A.G. also saw N.M. and M.G. touch the appellant’s
    penis with their hands and mouths. </p>
  <h2>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of A.M. and D.W.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.M. is the stepsister of A.G. and M.G., and was living with them at the
    time. D.W. was A.M.’s friend. Both were 16 at the time of trial. They testified
    that they were in the appellant’s room on one occasion, and he offered to pay
    them for oral sex. They refused. The appellant was acquitted on these counts. </p>
  <h2>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Disclosure</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The incidents came to light when N.M.’s mother saw the appellant’s text
    messages on her daughter’s phone. She thought that they were inappropriate. She
    asked her daughter about them, but N.M. denied that anything had happened. N.M.
    eventually disclosed the sexual abuse. N.M.’s mother was shocked by the
    disclosure, but needed time to consider the implications of what she had been
    told. She told N.M. not to tell anyone in the meantime.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span

    This led D.A. to tell her own mother, who called N.M.’s mother two days after
    the initial disclosure. The police investigated. They told all involved not to
    talk about the allegations. However, N.M.’s mother acknowledged that there were
    times when her daughter wanted to talk about things. At that point she learned
    of the involvement of some of the other girls.</p>

    asked. They agreed to “get their stories straight.” De. A. agreed that N.M.
    told her to stick to her story, but the story was true. The talk about “getting

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The process of balancing probative value
    against prejudicial effect is the trial judge's responsibility. Appellate
    courts will defer to the trial judge's assessment of the comparative probative
    value and prejudicial effect of the proffered evidence unless an appellant can
    demonstrate that the result of the trial judge's analysis is unreasonable, or
    is undermined by a legal error or a misapprehension of material evidence:

  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Collusion and the Burden of Proof</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In similar fact evidence cases, at the admissibility stage, the
    trial judge’s main task is to weigh the probative value of the evidence against
    its potential prejudicial effect. The possibility of collusion may significantly
    affect this balancing. As Binnie J. said in <em>Handy</em>,<i> </i>at para. 99:
    “<span lang=EN-GB>An important element of the probative weight analysis is the
    issue of potential&nbsp;</span><em>collusion</em><i><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></i><span
lang=EN-GB>between the complainant and the ex-wife” (emphasis in original). In </span><em>Shearing</em><span
lang=EN-GB>, Binnie J. again identified collusion as a matter related to the
    “strength of the evidence.” As he said, at para. 40: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The theory of similar fact evidence turns
    largely on the improbability of coincidence. Collusion, by offering an
    alternative explanation for the &quot;coincidence&quot; of evidence emanating
    from different witnesses, destroys its probative value, and therefore the basis
    for its admissibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB> Although collusion is a feature of probative
    value, it is singled out for special consideration at the admissibility stage.
    It is not simply part of the overall balancing undertaken by the trial judge; instead,
    the Crown must disprove the possibility of collusion. Justice Binnie
    articulated the test in </span><em>Handy</em><span lang=EN-GB>, at para. 112: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly where, as here, there is some
    evidence of actual&nbsp;<a name="ORIGHIT_33"></a><a name="HIT_33"></a>collusion<b>,</b>&nbsp;or
    at least an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the allegations, the Crown is
    required to satisfy the trial judge, on a balance of probabilities, that the
    evidence of similar facts is not tainted with&nbsp;<a name="ORIGHIT_34"></a><a
name="HIT_34"></a>collusion<b>.</b>&nbsp;That much would gain admission. It
    would then be for the jury to make the ultimate determination of its worth.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dividing line between cases in which collusion is a live issue, and
    cases in which it is not, is the presence of an “air of reality.” As Binnie J.
    held in <em>Handy</em>, at para. 111: “The issue is concoction or collaboration,
    not contact. If the evidence amounts to no more than opportunity, it will
    usually best be left to the jury.” In that case, the Court agreed that there
    was something more – an air of reality, based on a financial incentive on the
    part of the complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court in <em>Shearing</em> also addressed the issue of collusion. As
    Binnie J. held, at para. 44:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The evidence here is far more speculative than
    in&nbsp;<i>Handy</i>.&nbsp; In that case, there was consultation between the
    complainant and the similar fact witness&nbsp;<i>prior</i>&nbsp;to the alleged
    offence about the prospect of financial profit.&nbsp; <u>Here, there is some
    evidence of opportunity for collusion or collaboration and motive, but nothing
    sufficiently persuasive to trigger the trial judge’s gatekeeper function.&nbsp;</u> There is no reason here to interfere with the trial judge’s decision to let the
    collusion issue go to the jury.&nbsp; He instructed the jury to consider “all
    of the circumstances which affect the reliability of that evidence including
    the possibility of collusion or collaboration between the complainants”.&nbsp; <u>He
    defined collusion as the possibility that the complainants, in sharing their
    stories with one another, intentionally or accidentally allowed themselves to
    change or modify their stories in order that their testimony would seem more
    similar or more convincing.</u>&nbsp; It was for the jury to make the ultimate
    determination whether the evidence was “reliable despite the opportunity for
    collaboration” or that “less weight or no weight should be given to evidence
    which may have been influenced by the sharing of information”.&nbsp;[Italics in
    original; underline added.]</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge reviewed a number of the governing
    authorities. He was aware of t</span>he threshold the Crown was required to
    meet when an air of reality of collusion was established. He mentioned this
    standard several times in his reasons, but in a general way. That is, he did
    not specify whether he was talking about actual collusion, unconscious collusion,
    or both. The appellant points to the following passage in the trial judge’s
    ruling and submits that it reveals that he misapplied this burden of proof in
    relation to unconscious collusion, at paras. 116-117:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although cross-examined vigorously on this topic, none of the
    witnesses were shaken in the denial that they had colluded with respect to the
    allegations. Although some agreed in cross-examination, that before going to
    the police, they had “got their story straight”, all explained that phrase to
    be entirely appropriate discussions between themselves</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The stories told were simple ones to tell; even so, the
    complainants are children and one would expect that collusion would have become
    obvious over time. That did not occur here. <u>While there may have been
    unconscious tainting between the witnesses, there was no evidence that the
    possibility was so strong as to exclude the evidence</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The trial judge concluded his ruling by saying, “I am
    therefore satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there was no collusion
    between the witnesses”: at para. 120. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that, while the trial judge properly placed the
    burden on the Crown to disprove actual collusion, he failed to hold the Crown
    to the same standard with respect to “unconscious tainting”. He contends that
    the above-quoted passage reveals the trial judge was not satisfied on a balance
    of probabilities that the Crown had disproved tainting by unconscious
    collusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>Read in the context of his reasons as a whole, the
    impugned passage suggests that the trial judge did not specifically consider
    whether the Crown met its burden in relation to unconscious collusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge erred in this respect. Although the
    case was fought largely on the basis of actual collusion, </span>there was
    clearly an “air of reality” to the assertion of unconscious collusion. The
    trial judge acknowledged as much in the underscored passage above. The law
    required that the Crown be held to the same standard of disproving that the
    evidence was tainted by unconscious collusion on a balance of probabilities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fairness to the trial judge, there is a lack of precision in the case
    law concerning the treatment of unconscious collusion at the admissibility
    stage. In <em>Handy</em> and <em>Shearing</em>, the Court addressed collusion
    in its most literal sense. In both cases, it was alleged that the allegations
    were fabricated, and that two or more witnesses had agreed to proceed with a
    false story. In its treatment of this issue, the Court used different
    terminology to describe the same thing. <em>Handy</em><i> </i>employs the terms
    “collusion”, “actual collusion” and “concoct.” <em>Shearing</em><i> </i>refers
    to “collusion”, “concoction” and “concoct.” Neither case directly discusses
    “unconscious” or “inadvertent” collusion or tainting of similar fact witnesses.<a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, decisions from this court support the view that actual
    collusion and unconscious collusion ought to be treated the same way at the
    admissibility stage. In <em>R. v. F. (J.)</em> (2003), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont.
    C.A.), Feldman J.A. discusses both types of collusion, at para. 77:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge's finding that B.H. was
    sincere, a &quot;straight shooter&quot;, and not influenced by E.T. and the
    others, fails to take into account that collusion and discussion among
    witnesses can have the effect of tainting a witness's evidence and perception
    of events innocently or accidentally and unknowingly, as well as deliberately
    and intentionally. <u>The reliability of a witness's account can be undermined
    not only by deliberate collusion for the purpose of concocting evidence, but also
    by the influence of hearing other people's stories, which can tend to colour
    one's interpretation of personal events or reinforce a perception about which
    one had doubts or concerns.</u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><em>R. v. B. (C.)</em> (2003), 171 C.C.C. (3d)
    159 (Ont. C.A.) fosters the same approach. As the court said at paras. 40-41:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-GB>Collusion can arise both from a deliberate
    agreement to concoct evidence as well as from communication among witnesses
    that can have the effect, whether consciously or unconsciously, of colouring
    and tailoring their descriptions of the impugned events</span></u><span
lang=EN-GB>. In this case there was evidence of, or at least the opportunity
    for collusion in the various discussions regarding the incidents reported by
    the complainants. Furthermore, taken together with the anger regarding the
    dismissal and pay issues between one complainant and the appellant and the
    joint lawsuit by the complainants for damages, there was clearly an air of
    reality to the possibility of collusion in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-GB>It was therefore incumbent on the trial
    judge, in considering the admissibility of the similar fact evidence, to
    determine whether he was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
    evidence was not tainted by collusion.</span></u><span lang=EN-GB> In his
    ruling admitting the similar fact evidence, the trial judge did specifically
    refer to the fact that the witnesses had discussed some of the evidence with
    each other. [Emphasis added.] </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Ultimately, the case was decided on the basis of
    inadequacies in the trial judge’s instructions to the jury. Nevertheless, this
    passage supports the conclusion that, when there is an air of reality to
    conscious <em>or</em> unconscious collusion, the similar fact evidence will not
    be admissible unless the Crown proves on a balance of probabilities that
    conscious or unconscious collusion has not tainted the testimony.  </p>

    at para. 86: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Once admitted, the jury must still be warned

    C.C.C. (3d) 62, a case in which the trial judge allowed the jury to consider
    the evidence of six sexual assault complainants as similar fact evidence. Defence
    counsel at trial submitted that the evidence of the complainants, who were
    strangers, was tainted by media reports about the case. The trial judge concluded
    that there was no air of reality to the suggestion of inadvertent or
    unintentional collusion. In response to defence counsel’s jury address, which
    stressed the possibility of inadvertent tainting, the trial judge instructed
    the jury that there was no evidence of collusion that should concern them in
    assessing the similarities in the accounts of the witnesses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court allowed the appeal from conviction, holding that the
    trial judge erred in her jury instructions on collusion. The respondent relies
    upon the following passage from the judgment of <span lang=EN-GB>the court</span>,
    at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Here, it is clear that there was at least some
    evidence of possible inadvertent collusion, perhaps not enough to deny the
    similar fact application, but sufficient to raise concerns that the opportunity
    for tainting of the evidence existed. <u>Put another way, there was at least an
    air of reality to the possibility of inadvertent collusion.</u> As discussed
    in&nbsp;<i>Shearing</i>, the trial judge should have left it with the jury to
    decide the effect that possible collusion may have had on the weight to be
    assigned to the evidence of the complainants. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The language used in <em>Dorsey</em> is resonant of the trial judge’s
    ruling in this case. Whereas the court in <em>Dorsey</em> spoke of,
    “inadvertent collusion, perhaps not enough to deny the similar fact
    application”, the trial judge (who cited <em>Dorsey</em> in his ruling) said,
    “[w]hile there may have been unconscious tainting between the witnesses, there
    was no evidence that the possibility was so strong as to exclude the evidence”:
    at para. 117. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not attach the same weight to the passage from<i> <em>Dorsey</em></i> as the respondent urges us to do. The decision did not turn on the question of
    admissibility. The appeal was allowed on the basis that there was an air of
    reality and the trial judge erred in taking away from the jury any consideration
    whatsoever of the potential for inadvertent collusion or tainting. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of <em>Handy</em> and <em>Shearing</em>, and its treatment
    in other judgments of this court, the proper approach is to treat actual and
    unconscious collusion in the same manner at the admissibility stage. This
    conclusion is supported by academic commentators: see, for example, Sidney N.
    Lederman, Alan W. Bryant and Michelle K. Fuerst, <em>The Law of Evidence in
    Canada</em>, 4th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2014), at pp. 724-726;

    Canadian Criminal Evidence</em>, 5th ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters Canada
    Limited, 2016), Vol. 1, at pp. 10-64 to 10-68. Consequently, the trial judge
    erred by not subjecting the issue of unconscious collusion to the same
    treatment as actual collusion.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge erred in the application of the burden of proof, I
    would apply the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 to dismiss the appeal. No substantial wrong or miscarriage
    of justice was occasioned by the trial judge’s legal error. I reach this
    conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the real issue at trial was whether N.M. fabricated the
    allegations against the appellant and then enlisted the assistance of the other
    complainants to further her campaign. The similar fact application did not turn
    on the <em>minutiae</em> of the complainants’ accounts; it was fought on the
    basis of “did this really happen?”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It is clear from the trial judge’s ruling that he was alive to the possibility
    of unconscious collusion. He considered it in weighing the probative value of
    the evidence against its prejudicial effect and determined that it did not
    warrant exclusion. Far from not screening for unconscious collusion at all, the
    trial judge satisfied himself that it was safe to leave the matter with the
    jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The similar fact ruling related to witnesses whose evidence was already
    before the jury. In other words, the ruling did not relate to the admissibility
    of witnesses who the jury would not otherwise have had heard testify. The jury
    was properly instructed on how to assess the credibility and reliability of all
    of these witnesses. Their evidence was reviewed in great detail in the trial
    judge’s final instructions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge provided the jury with appropriate guidance on
    how the evidence could be used for similar fact purposes. This included an
    instruction on the need to be aware of the possibility of conscious and
    unconscious tainting. His instructions were not objected to at trial; they are
    not challenged on appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not allow the appeal on this basis.   </p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failing to Consider and Misapprehending Evidence of Unintentional
    Collusion</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider certain
    aspects of the evidence that impacted on unintentional collusion, while
    misapprehending others. Although they were raised as separate grounds of
    appeal, I address them together because they essentially amount to the same
    complaint. This argument really goes to the heart of the balancing undertaken
    by the trial judge. It is at this juncture where deference should be most
    potent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To succeed on this basis, the misapprehension must be relevant to
    a material issue: see <em>R. v. Morrissey</em> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.),
    at p. 538. As Binnie J. held in <em>R. v. Lohrer</em>, 2004 SCC 80, [2004] 3
    S.C.R. 732, at para. 2: <span lang=EN-GB>“The misapprehension of the evidence
    must go to the substance rather than to the detail. It must be material rather
    than peripheral to the reasoning of the trial judge.”&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the respondent that none of the misapprehensions identified
    by the appellant are material in the sense considered in the case law; instead,
    the appellant complains that the trial judge failed to wade among the factual <em>minutiae</em> of seven young witnesses during a month-long jury trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his factum and in oral argument, appellant’s counsel placed great
    emphasis on: (a) the internal inconsistencies in the testimony given by each of
    the complainants; (b) the inconsistencies between that testimony and the
    complainant’s prior statements to the police and at the preliminary inquiry;
    and (c) the fact that certain details of the allegations between the
    complainants were mutually inconsistent. The appellant tries to link these testimonial
    features to the similar fact evidence ruling. However, they are in reality
    arguments meant to attack the reasonableness of the jury’s verdicts and an
    attempt to retry the case on appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge spent a great deal of time focused on collusion among
    the complainants. Indeed, this was the focal point of his ruling. He considered
    the evidence of the witnesses in great detail. He determined that some
    inconsistencies between the witnesses were important, while others were not.
    The trial judge’s findings were available to him on the record and should not
    be disturbed on appeal: see R. v. Roy, 2017 ONCA 30, 136 W.C.B. (2d) 103, at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I further agree with the respondent that the failure of the trial judge
    to mention certain pieces of evidence does not lead to the conclusion that he
    failed to consider them. The trial judge released his reasons on the similar
    fact ruling a few months after delivering his final instructions to the jury.
    However, he made his similar fact ruling (with reasons to follow) shortly
    before instructing the jury. The final instructions included a 10-page, 40-paragraph
    summary of the evidence under the heading, “Collusion Among Similar Act Witnesses.”
    Defence counsel did not object to this aspect of the jury charge. In the
    circumstances, it is difficult to see how the trial judge could have failed to
    properly consider this evidence when making his similar fact ruling. His
    subsequent reasons confirm that he did just that.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
