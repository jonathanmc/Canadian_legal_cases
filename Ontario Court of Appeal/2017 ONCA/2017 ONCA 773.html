    A. Wilson of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, dated December

  <p class=Endorsement align=left style='text-align:left'><strong>Lauwers J.A.</strong></p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a jury trial of an action for medical negligence. Jordan Sacks
    (who appeals along with his wife Lisa, his children Ryan, Alexis and Emma, and
    his parents Michael and Annette), suffered serious injuries arising from
    complications after routine bowel surgery. An anastomotic leak occurred after
    the surgery, spilling bowel contents into Mr. Sacks’s abdominal cavity. (It is
    not argued that the leak was the result of negligence.) An anastomotic leak
    must be treated quickly to prevent infection, sepsis and septic shock, but the
    discovery of the leak was delayed. By the time treatment started, Mr. Sacks was
    in septic shock. He was then in a coma for weeks and ultimately required
    amputation of both legs below his knees and all of his fingertips. These were
    horrifying injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellants asserted that the delay in diagnosis and
    treatment caused Mr. Sacks’s injuries, and was the result of cumulative errors made
    by the respondents, a team composed of doctors and nurses who treated Mr. Sacks
    after surgery, along with Sunnybrook Hospital.  Their negligence caused his
    injuries. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents answered that any delay in diagnosis and treatment did
    not cause Mr. Sacks’s injuries. The delay was not material to the outcome
    because Mr. Sacks contracted a rare, unrecognized aggressive necrotizing
    infection (flesh eating disease) in his right lower back, which could not have
    been diagnosed or treated when it first arose. His injuries were unavoidable
    and not the result of anyone’s breach of a standard of care. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the jury found five of the defendants breached elements of their
    respective standards of care, they did not find that any of the breaches caused
    the injuries at issue. The action was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According to the appellants, <span lang=EN-US>the trial proceeded
    on a mistaken understanding of the appropriate causation test to be applied in
    a case of delayed diagnosis and treatment. This mistake was reflected in the
    jury questions and instructions. Accordingly, the jury’s answers were ambiguous
    and could not form a safe basis for judgment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents submit, to the contrary, that the trial
    judge did engage the correct causation test and formulated appropriate jury
    questions and instructions. The jury had before it two clearly opposed explanations
    of causation, and simply found the evidence and the arguments advanced by the
    respondents to be more persuasive. The jury’s answers were clear and not ambiguous.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns the proper test for causation in delayed diagnosis
    medical negligence cases involving multiple tortfeasors. The appellants submit
    that in such cases this court should require trial judges to use a “global but
    for” test for causation. The respondents vigorously resist the imposition of a
    “global but for” test, which they describe as a novel test for causation. They
    say that the positions taken by the appellants in the court below preclude the
    relief sought on appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would dismiss the appeal. In my view the jury
    clearly and unambiguously accepted the defence evidence on the cause of Mr.
    Sacks’s injuries. As I will explain, while I agree with the appellants that the
    jury questions and instructions were problematic, the deficiencies in them did
    not affect the outcome. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Procedural Issue</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents correctly point out that this court is reluctant to
    consider new arguments on appeal: <em>Kaiman v Graham</em>, 2009 ONCA 77 at
    para. 18. They argue that the appellants’ trial counsel at no time argued that
    the jury should be asked a causation question globally in relation to all
    defendants. Nor did he raise this concern after reading the trial judge’s draft
    jury charge or hearing the charge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I engage with the “global but for” test issue in this appeal, for two reasons.
    First, from the outset the underlying question in this case was how to apply
    the “but for” test in cases of delayed medical diagnosis and treatment involving
    multiple defendant tortfeasors. This question was incompletely argued before
    the trial judge but the approach taken on appeal is no surprise. The appellants
    pursued the case at trial on the basis that the entire team at Sunnybrook
    Hospital was at fault. As trial counsel stated at the outset of his jury
    address jury: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Based on the evidence I’m going to suggest to you that this
    represents a total failure of the entire healthcare team and all of its members
    in parts. It is a total systems failure. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The implications of this approach were not thought
    through until this appeal where it was fully argued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, cases that engage jury questions, jury instructions and
    the causation test involving multiple tortfeasors do not often come to this
    court. In my view, this court has a responsibility to consider the issues and to
    provide assistance to trial judges and counsel in such cases going forward.</p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2008, Mr. Sacks was a 36 year old married accountant who had Crohn’s disease
    but was otherwise in good health. A colonoscopy had previously revealed a
    narrowing of his bowel, which exposed him to the future risk of an obstruction.
    Mr. Sacks decided to have a hemicolectomy, an elective surgery that would
    remove the narrowing. He waited until after tax season to have the procedure
    performed by Dr. Theodore Ross, who was acquainted with the family of Mr. Sacks’s
    wife Lisa.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    development of an anastomotic leak, in which the sutures holding the ends of
    the bowel come apart and stool leaks into the abdominal cavity, is a recognized
    complication of a hemicolectomy and occurs in 2-5% of cases. It can be life
    threatening. The large quantity of bacteria in stool can be a source of
    infection that can, if not promptly treated, progress to sepsis, severe sepsis
    and ultimately septic shock. If a leak occurs, it is essential to control the
    source of infection as soon as possible. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Symptoms
    of anastomotic leak include abdominal distention, abdominal pain, shoulder
    pain, an increase in heart rate (tachycardia), a decline in blood pressure
    (hypotension) and variability in white blood cell count.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    surgery was performed on May 13, 2008 at Sunnybrook Hospital by Dr. Ross,
    assisted by Dr. Anna Bendzsak, a senior resident, and Dr. Aliyah Kanji, a
    junior resident. There were no surgical complications and Mr. Sacks’s recovery
    was uneventful for the first two days.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Sacks’s condition started to deteriorate on May 16, 2008. At 7:50 am, he
    complained to Nurse Pamela Raye-Ilogu of abdominal distention, and he remained
    distended throughout the day. His white blood cell count was 9.5, within a normal
    range. At 12:50 pm, Mr. Sacks complained of abdominal pain. On a scale of one
    to ten, with ten being the patient’s “worst pain”, Nurse Raye-Ilogu recorded
    the pain as an eight while resting and ten while moving. She gave Mr. Sacks
    pain medication. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    4:30 pm, Nurse Raye-Ilogu informed Dr. Bendzsak and Dr. Kanji of Mr. Sacks’s
    severe (“+++”) shoulder pain. This was the first time Nurse Raye-Ilogu
    contacted a doctor about Mr. Sacks’s pain since starting to care for him on May
    14. At 4:40 pm, Dr. Kanji, under the supervision of Dr. Bendzsak, prescribed
    morphine. Dr. Kanji also ordered a complete blood count “NOW please”, to check
    for a possible infectious process and other possible issues. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anastomotic
    leak was part of the differential diagnosis of Dr. Kanji and Dr. Bendzsak. Several
    of the defendant doctors testified that if there were a specific concern about
    infection, they would want to know as soon as possible, and would want the
    blood results as soon as possible. At trial, Dr. Kanji testified that the
    bloodwork order was not made specifically to identify possible infection, but
    it could be identified by the bloodwork. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nurse
    Raye-Ilogu entered Dr. Kanji’s request in the hospital computer at 5:08 pm as a
    “STAT” order, called the lab to inform them of the order, and recorded it in
    the chart. STAT bloodwork results are ordinarily available within one hour. Dr.
    Kanji testified that the “NOW please” order was specifically intended not to be
    a “STAT” order. Nurse Raye-Ilogu explained that she entered the order as a
    “STAT” order because “STAT” was the closest approximation of “NOW please” that
    was available in the computer system.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nurse
    Raye-Ilogu went off duty at 7:30 pm. She informed Nurse Xia Li, who was
    assuming Mr. Sacks’s care, about the bloodwork order. Dr. Kanji also went off
    duty at 7:30 pm and did not check to see whether the results of the bloodwork
    order were available. She discussed Mr. Sacks with Dr. Bendzsak, who would be
    assuming his care. Dr. Kanji expected the doctors on duty overnight to
    follow-up on the bloodwork order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Sacks saw Mr. Sacks during the day and evening of May 16. She was concerned and
    called Dr. Ross at home about Mr. Sacks’s deteriorating condition. Dr. Ross
    came in to the hospital around 7:30 or 8:00 pm and examined Mr. Sacks. He spoke
    to Dr. Bendzsak but did not recall checking the chart, speaking to Nurse Li or
    checking the status of the bloodwork order. He made no notes of his examination
    in the chart. He told Mrs. Sacks that Mr. Sacks’s pain could be typical and
    they should wait until the next day to see what would happen.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    8:00 pm, Nurse Li examined Mr. Sacks. He was slightly tachycardic and his blood
    pressure was lower than the normal range. She did not report Mr. Sacks’s vital
    signs to a doctor. He was still in pain and Nurse Li administered morphine.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    results of the bloodwork ordered by Dr. Kanji were entered into the hospital’s
    computer system at 9:51 pm, four and a half hours after being ordered. The
    delay was inconsistent with hospital policy, and was not reported to the floor
    or to the requesting physician, also contrary to the policy. The lab result
    showed that Mr. Sacks had a white blood cell count of 1.8 – a result considered
    abnormally low and for which a confirmatory test was usually done to ensure its
    accuracy. It was entered in the computer as “CRITICAL” and marked in red.
    However, the critical result was not reported by the lab to the ward or the
    ordering physician. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    hospital witness explained that even though the result was marked as “CRITICAL”
    in the system, the result was not actually critical at the campus of the
    hospital where Mr. Sacks was being treated. The computer system was shared by
    various campuses with different criteria for what constituted “critical”. Mr.
    Sacks’s result was considered critical at a different campus but not the campus
    where he was being treated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Giacomantonio, an expert witness called by the plaintiffs, testified that the
    significant drop in the white blood cell count was a finding that should have
    raised alarms about infection, and ultimately, sepsis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    Dr. Bendzsak nor Nurse Li followed up on the blood result overnight even though
    they were both on duty. Mr. Sacks complained of back pain for the first time in
    the early morning hours of May 17. Nurse Li called Dr. Jeffery Singer, a junior
    resident, to assess Mr. Sacks. Dr. Singer thought the back pain might have been
    the result of Mr. Sacks being immobile in a hospital bed and prescribed a
    muscle relaxant and sedative. Dr. Singer did not talk to Dr. Bendzsak or become
    aware of the bloodwork results.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Ross returned to the hospital before 9:00 am for morning rounds. Dr. Bendzsak
    went off duty at 9:00 am and turned Mr. Sacks’s care over to Dr. Ross. Around
    this time, both Dr. Bendzsak and Dr. Ross learned about the bloodwork results
    indicating a low white blood cell count. Dr. Ross was “certainly concerned [Mr.
    Sacks] had an infection”. Dr. Ross ordered STAT bloodwork. The results came
    back at about 10:50 am confirming the low white blood cell count. His blood
    pressure dropped further. Dr. Ross then believed that Mr. Sacks had an
    infection. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these results, Dr. Giacomantonio testified that the only possible conclusion
    a surgeon could then draw was that Mr. Sacks was septic because of an
    anastomotic leak, and the operating room should have been the next stop.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    Dr. Ross ordered a STAT CT scan. He testified that although he believed Mr.
    Sacks had an infection in the morning, he wanted to identify the source of the
    low white blood cell count before proceeding with treatment. He did not start
    antibiotics until 4:00 pm because he first wanted to identify the source of the
    infection and control it, treatment which the antibiotics would supplement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    CT scan was not performed until approximately 3:00 pm. Only one of the
    hospital’s four CT scanners was running because of reduced staffing levels on
    the weekend (and only three were operational at the time). The CT scan
    confirmed the anastomotic leak. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Sacks was taken to the operating room to repair the leak by 5:05 pm. He was in
    septic shock. He underwent surgery from 5:29 pm to 6:55 pm to repair the leak
    and wash out the peritoneal cavity. There was gross contamination in the belly.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Sacks went home at 10:00 pm. She received a call at 1:30 am from Mr. Sacks’s
    mother at the hospital. Mrs. Sacks returned to the hospital and was told that
    Mr. Sacks might not make it through the night. He was very ill for the next new
    few days. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Sacks went into kidney failure and required multiple surgeries over the next
    few months. Some of his tissues became necrotic and he developed compartment
    syndrome. He was in a medically induced coma for three months. Ultimately,
    amputation of both of Mr. Sacks’s legs below the knee and all ten fingertips
    was required.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.

    delay in diagnosing and treating the anastomotic leak caused Mr. Sacks’s
    injuries. In order to control his low blood pressure he was given powerful
    vasopressors which, in combination with the sepsis, led to the need for the
    amputations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the respondents’ explanation was that the delay was not material to Mr. Sacks’s
    outcome because he contracted a rare, unrecognized aggressive necrotizing
    infection in his right lower back (retroperitoneal – “RPN” or “RPNI”), which
    could not have been diagnosed on May 17. As a result, his injuries were
    unavoidable and not the result of anyone’s breach of a standard of care. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span

lang=EN-US>at para 8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The test for showing causation is the &quot;but for&quot; test.
    The plaintiff must show on a balance of probabilities that &quot;but for&quot;
    the defendant's negligent act, the injury would not have occurred. Inherent in
    the phrase &quot;but for&quot; is the requirement that the defendant's
    negligence was <i>necessary</i> to bring about the injury -- in other words
    that the injury would not have occurred without the defendant's negligence.
    This is a factual inquiry. If the plaintiff does not establish this on a
    balance of probabilities, having regard to all the evidence, her action against
    the defendant fails. [Emphasis by McLachlin C.J.]</p>

    a factual inquiry. In all instances of determining causation, Professor Russell
    Brown (as he then was) observed that the trier of fact proceeds by inference

    of a game of billiards in which the combinations of balls striking balls can be
    easily replicated. The closest equivalent would be a simple case involving a
    single defendant who did something in breach of the standard of care that physically
    hurt the defendant, where the “but for” test is relatively easy to apply.
    Consider the cases in which the defendant accidently shoots the plaintiff in a
    hunting mishap, or where the defendant runs a red light and collides with the
    plaintiff who suffers physical trauma. Causation is not usually a live issue in
    such cases because the causal inferences are so easy to draw.</span></p>

    is not about something the defendant did, but about something the defendant
    failed to do in breach of the standard of care. When what is in issue is not
    the defendant’s act, but an omission, the trier of fact is required to attend
    to the fact situation as it existed in reality the moment before the
    defendant’s breach of the standard of care, and then to imagine that the
    defendant took the action the standard of care obliged her to take, in order to
    determine whether her doing so would have prevented or reduced the injury. Even
    though this exercise is bounded significantly by the actual facts, it counts as
    “factual” because the task is to consider how the events would actually have unfolded
    had the defendant taken the action she was obliged to take. </span></p>

    cases, noting at paras. 12 and 43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In some cases, an injury -- the loss for which the plaintiff
    claims compensation -- may flow from a number of different negligent acts
    committed by different actors, each of which is a necessary or &quot;but
    for&quot; cause of the injury. In such cases, the defendants are said to be
    jointly and severally liable. The judge or jury then apportions liability
    according to the degree of fault of each defendant pursuant to contributory
    negligence legislation.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is important to reaffirm that in the usual case of multiple
    agents or actors, the traditional &quot;but for&quot; test still applies. The
    question, as discussed earlier, is whether the plaintiff has shown that one or
    more of the defendants' negligence was a necessary cause of the injury. Degrees
    of fault are reflected in calculations made under contributory negligence
    legislation.</p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>“But for” causation is therefore not
    complicated in successive or cumulative injury context when one focusses solely
    on each actor and each actor’s role in a causal story. The confusion results
    when one forgets two things: first, that it is a defendant’s breach of the
    standard of care that is the locus of the causal inquiry, and second, that a

    to decide the case. Jury questions should respond to the facts in issue and be
    logically sequential.  They should be expressed as simply and clearly as
    possible; a question should not be compound or contain an embedded assumption. Jury
    questions should also be neutrally expressed and should not nudge the jury

  <p class=CQuote>To avoid the problem encountered in this case due to the
    inscrutability of the jury's response to the question relating to negligence,
    and as a precaution to test the jury's understanding of the instruction, the
    question to the jury with respect to negligence should require that the jury
    specify in what respects the defendant was negligent. In a case in which the
    general rule applies, the answer will reveal whether the jury has understood
    and applied the judge's instruction that it must accept the standard practice
    as the legal standard against which the defendant's conduct must be measured. Additionally,
    in a case which falls within the exception to the general rule and where the
    jury can fix the standard irrespective of the expert evidence, the answer to
    the question will ensure that the standard which the jury has adopted is not

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties could not agree on the wording of the questions to be put to the jury
    on causation at trial. The trial judge made a ruling: 2015 ONSC 7238, 2015
    CarswellOnt 18932. </p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Appellants’ Trial Position on the Jury Questions</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submitted at trial that the “but for” test for causation was
    applicable and disavowed any attempt to engage the “material contribution”
    test.  However, they asserted that phrasing the jury questions in terms of the
    language of the “but for” test as it is set out in <em>Clements</em> would confuse
    the jurors, particularly in using the word “necessary”, which suggests that
    each defendant’s conduct must be the sole cause of the plaintiff’s injury. They
    pointed out that in delayed diagnosis cases one defendant’s conduct will
    rarely, if ever, be the sole cause. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel argued the plaintiffs need not prove that a specific defendant’s negligent
    act or omission was the <em>sole</em> cause of the injury, only that it was <em>a</em> cause, citing <em>Athey</em>, para. 17, where Major J. said:  “It is not now
    necessary, nor has it ever been, for the plaintiff to establish that the
    defendant's negligence was the sole cause of the injury.” He added: “As long as
    a defendant is part of the cause of an injury, the defendant is liable, even
    though his act alone was not enough to create the injury.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appellants’ trial counsel sought this wording for the jury causation
    question: “Did the failure of ______ to meet the standard of care cause or
    contribute to Mr. Sacks’ injury?” This proposed formulation picked up the
    language of s. 1 of the <em>Negligence Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1. Counsel
    referred to several cases in this court where similar language was used.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondents’ Trial Position on the Jury Questions</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel for the respondents submitted that in wording the jury questions there
    was no reason for the court to deviate from the language used by the Supreme
    Court in <em>Clements</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>. </span></em>Trial
    counsel for the doctors argued that the jury instructions could correct any
    impression left by the<i> <em>Clements’</em></i> wording that the “but for”
    test required the jury to find any defendant to be the sole cause of the
    plaintiff’s injury. He added that using the terminology of “caused or
    contributed to” in the jury questions could confuse the jury because it might
    allow them to find that a defendant contributed to the delay in a way that that
    was not material, (in the sense that it was<i> <em>de minimis</em></i> and not
    sufficiently substantial to give rise to liability). </p>
  <h5>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ruling</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    set the jury questions regarding causation, the trial judge <span lang=EN-US>cited
    the test prescribed by the Supreme Court in </span><em>Clements</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> quoted above</span>.</em> She noted the distinction
    between the “but for” test for factual causation on the one hand, and the
    “material contribution to the risk of injury” test, on the other hand, but
    found this case was not the exceptional one in which the material contribution
    test to determine cause-in-fact should be used. (This holding is not challenged
    on appeal.) She noted the respondents’ argument, at para. 9: “Inherent in the
    phrase &quot;but for&quot; is the requirement that the defendant's negligence
    was <span class=Underline>necessary</span> to bring about the injury – in other
    words, that the injury would not have occurred without the defendant's
    negligence.” (Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in wording the jury questions, the trial judge found, at para. 13, “there is no
    compelling reason not to use the language of causation from <em>Clements</em>.”
    She stated that using the phrase, “caused or contributed to,” as proposed by
    the plaintiffs, could confuse the jury; the use of such language in the <em>Negligence
    Act</em> does not mean it should be used in jury questions. </p>

    part of one or more of the defendants that caused or contributed to the delay

lang=EN-US>Regarding the first event, the argument is that had </span>Nurse
    Raye-Ilogu pursued the blood test results earlier, Sunnybrook staff would have
    processed the request earlier, perhaps by several hours. It was open to the
    jury to have found Nurse Raye-Ilogu beached the standard of care in failing to
    follow up, and to find that, on the balance of probabilities, she contributed
    to the cumulative delay in diagnosis and treatment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering the second event, the jury would have been required to ignore its
    finding with respect to the first event, and to consider Sunnybrook’s possible
    breaches of the standard of care on the facts as they actually occurred, not on
    the facts that would have occurred if Nurse Raye-Ilogu had pursued the blood
    test results earlier. In other words, the jury was required to keep its
    assessment of the two events separate.</p>

    track through the events of the case in considering how to interpret the jury’s
    answers below. My purpose here, in picking out these two events as examples, is
    to note that a jury considering a negligence claim against multiple tortfeasors
    requires careful instructions on the reasoning process it must employ in moving
    through the events in order to determine causation. The jury charge in this
    case did not provide such instructions.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='line-height:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><span lang=EN-US> </span>Problems with Using the <i>Clements</i>’
    Wording of the “But For” Test in Jury Instructions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants
    concede in their factum that the trial judge “adequately instructed the jury on
    how to apply the “but for” test to address the problem of factual uncertainty
    in this case.” However, they assert that the trial judge’s use of the wording
    in <em>Clements</em>, particularly with its focus on the word “necessary,”
    introduced a fatal ambiguity into the questions that rendered the jury’s answers
    unreliable. Appeal counsel’s submissions echoed and deepened the argument advanced
    by trial counsel about the wording of the jury questions. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Basic Factual Question was not Asked</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants submit
    that the jury was not asked to determine whether there was a delay in the
    diagnosis and treatment of Mr. Sacks’s condition that caused his injuries, quite
    apart from any negligence, which is the first step in the causal reasoning
    process. This I infer to be the core of the appeal argument that the questions
    and instructions were deficient because “the jury never had the opportunity to
    consider what would have happened but for “the failure to diagnose the
    anastomotic leak in a timely fashion””.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject
    this argument. In my view, that is exactly the import of a statement in the
    trial judge’s instructions, which I repeat:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In an action alleging delay in diagnosis and treatment, such as
    this one, the plaintiff must establish on a balance of probabilities that the
    failure to diagnose the anastomotic leak in a timely fashion was a necessary
    cause of the unfavourable outcome for Jordan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would have
    been preferable to have included a basic question to this effect in the jury
    questions (but omitting the word “necessary” as I will explain). The trial
    judge in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Goodwin v. Olupona</span></em>, <span
lang=EN-US>2013 ONCA 259, 325 O.A.C. 245 took a similar approach by first
    asking: “When did Adam Goodwin sustain his injuries?...”</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span>But there is no doubt that in this case the jury was told
    the crux of the point.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    Problem of “Circular Causation”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants
    submit it was wrong for “the jury [to be] asked to determine whether the
    conduct of each defendant – on his or her own – was <span class=Underline>necessary</span> to bring about Jordan’s injuries” (emphasis added). More specifically, they
    argue:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The jury in this case, however, was asked whether Jordan’s
    injuries would have been avoided but for the breaches of each<strong> individual </strong>defendant, one by one. In light of the evidence at trial
    about the collective nature of the errors that caused Jordan’s injuries, it is
    understandable that the jury answered “no” to the causation questions posed
    about each defendant individually. It may well be the case that but for the
    breaches of Dr. Ross, or Dr. Kanji, or Dr. Bendzsak, or Nurse Li, or Sunnybrook
    Hospital <strong>on their own</strong>, Jordan’s injuries would not have been
    avoided. But that is not the question the law requires the trier of fact to
    consider.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The jury was never asked the crucial question in this case: but
    for <strong>the delay</strong> occasioned by the defendants’ breaches of the
    standard of care, would Jordan’s injuries have been avoided? Jordan is entitled
    in law to receive an answer to this question. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The error, the
    appellants assert, is that on the facts of this case, “no <span
class=Underline>individual</span> defendant’s conduct could be said to have
    been necessary to cause the harm.” The issue arises in cases where: “multiple
    defendants’ collective negligence may create more delay than was actually
    necessary to cause the injury.” They invoke Professor Knutsen’s critique of
    what he dubbed “circular causation” in his 2010 article, at pp. 163,187. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel stated
    in oral argument:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In some cases, we say, this is a classic example, one
    defendant’s negligence may not be necessary to bring about an injury when
    considered in isolation, but it may be necessary to bring about an injury when
    considered in conjunction with the negligence of other tortfeasors where the
    cumulative effect of multiple breaches of the standard of care constitutes the
    necessary cause. In those cases the defendant’s negligence is part of the
    necessary cause even if it is not a necessary cause on its own. We say it
    doesn’t make sense that the plaintiff would be without a remedy at law simply
    because there’s not one individual defendant whose actions alone would have
    made a difference even if the combined negligence of a group of defendants, in
    this case members of the healthcare team, caused the injury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An example of
    the basic problem Professor Knutsen calls “circular causation” is found in

    Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm</em>,<i> </i>3d ed. (St. Paul, MN:

  <p class=CQuote>Able, Baker and Charlie, acting independently but
    simultaneously, each negligently lean on Paul’s car, which is parked at a
    scenic overlook at the edge of a mountain. Their combined force results in the
    car rolling over the edge of a diminutive curbstone and plummeting down the
    mountain to its destruction. The force exerted by each of Able, Baker and
    Charlie would have been insufficient to propel Paul’s car pass the curbstone,
    but the combined force of any two of them is sufficient. Able, Baker and
    Charlie are each a factual cause of the destruction of Paul’s car. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Professor Jane
    Stapleton notes that this example shows “a positive contribution which might be
    unnecessary”: “Unnecessary Causes”, (2013) 129 L.Q.R. 39. The idea is that each
    of Able, Baker and Charlie could step out of the causal chain. Each could claim
    his contribution to have been “unnecessary” to the damage since the force
    administered by the other two would have sufficed, even though each contributed
    to the force that caused the damage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='text-autospace:

    Stapleton cites this as one of several examples of “the striking outcomes that
    would flow if the law refused to recognize as ‘causal’ a positive contribution,
    albeit unnecessary, to the relevant step in the mechanism by which an
    indivisible injury occurred.” (p. 43). She proposes that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[the causal test be] framed as no more than whether that factor
    was <em>a</em> cause of the injury. This catchment is also neatly achieved by
    the well-known phrase ‘caused or contributed to’. The word ‘caused’ will easily
    identify necessary factors and the phrase ‘contributed to’ also accommodates
    the positive, albeit unnecessary, contributions being discussed here. (p. 45).</p>

  <p class=CQuote>Here, it is not a question of “which defendant”, but of
    multiple defendants’ compounding contributions, no one of which can be
    considered necessary <u>on its own</u>, but each of which composed part of a
    necessary cause (the delayed diagnosis). </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The only antidote is a “global but for
    test”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants
    now posit two jury questions related to causation, adding a prior question to
    the one trial counsel proffered:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Have the Plaintiffs proven, on a
    balance of probabilities, that but for the delay occasioned by the defendants’
    breaches of the standard of care, the injuries of Jordan Sacks would not have
    occurred?</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>If the answer to that question
    is “yes”, in respect of each individual defendant</em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Did the failure of [that
    defendant] to meet the standard of care cause or contribute to Jordan Sacks’
    injuries?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants
    base the “global but for” test on <em>Clements</em>. At para. 43 of the
    decision, McLachlin C.J. noted that in the case of multiple agents or actors,
    the traditional “but for” test applies, but the question becomes: “whether the
    plaintiff has shown that one or more of the defendants’ negligence was a
    necessary cause of the injury.” Chief Justice McLachlin was referring, in para.
    43 of <em>Clements</em>, to her earlier comments, at paras. 39 and 40, where<em><span
style='font-style:normal'> she twice used the expression “</span></em>viewed
    globally”: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>What then are the cases referring to when they say that it must
    be &quot;impossible&quot; to prove &quot;but for&quot; causation as a
    precondition to a material contribution to risk approach? The answer emerges
    from the facts of the cases that have adopted such an approach. Typically,
    there are a number of tortfeasors. All are at fault, and one or more has in
    fact caused the plaintiff's injury. The plaintiff would not have been injured
    &quot;but for&quot; their negligence, <u>viewed globally</u>. However, because
    each can point the finger at the other, it is impossible for the plaintiff to
    show on a balance of probabilities that any one of them in fact caused her
    injury. This is the impossibility of which <i>Cook</i> and the multiple
    employer mesothelioma cases speak.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The cases that have dispensed with the usual requirement of
    &quot;but for&quot; causation in favour of a less onerous material contribution
    to risk approach are generally cases where, &quot;but for&quot; the negligent
    act of one or more of the defendants, the plaintiff would not have been
    injured. …The plaintiff effectively has established that the &quot;but
    for&quot; test, <u>viewed globally</u>, has been met. It is only when it is
    applied separately to each defendant that the &quot;but for&quot; test breaks
    down because it cannot be shown which of several negligent defendants actually
    launched the event that led to the injury. The plaintiff thus has shown
    negligence and a relationship of duty owed by each defendant, but faces failure
    on the &quot;but for&quot; test because it is &quot;impossible&quot;, in the
    sense just discussed, to show which act or acts were injurious. In such cases,
    each defendant who has contributed to the risk of the injury that occurred can
    be faulted. (Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argue
    that this court has taken this global approach in delayed diagnosis cases, and cite<span
style='line-height:200%'> </span><em>Cottrelle</em><span style='line-height:

    or contributed to the unfavourable outcome.” <em>Cottrelle</em> involved a
    single tortfeasor, and <em>Wilson v. Beck</em> did not expressly address the
    issue. I am unable to agree that this court has at any time adopted the “global
    but for” test for which the appellants contend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the
    hospital respondents submits that the thrust of the language in <i>Clements</i> was to “reinforce the traditional individual ‘but for’ test” as against the
    material contribution test. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a fair

    Vaughan Black<em><span style='font-style:normal'> states that </span>Athey</em><em><span

    view is that <em>Clements</em> “has in fact been successful in turning back the
    causation clock to a more defendant-favouring age”: “The Rise and Fall of

    test. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To reflect the
    causal reasoning process, I would have framed the jury questions as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Have the Plaintiffs proven, on a
    balance of probabilities, that a delay in treatment caused Jordan Sacks’s
    injuries? </p>

  <p class=CQuote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Have the Plaintiffs proven, on a
    balance of probabilities, that the delay resulting from [this defendant’s]
    breach of the standard of care caused or contributed to the injuries of Jordan

  <p class=CQuote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>How did [this defendant] breach the
    standard of care? Please provide clear and specific answers.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The jury instructions would have to be adjusted accordingly.
    In such instructions the use of the word “necessary” should be avoided in
    describing the “but for” test.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='text-autospace:
none'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>This approach does not impose a “global but for” test. </span>The first question in the causal reasoning process is about a plain
    fact: did the delay cause the injury because treatment came too late? This step
    requires the trier of fact to consider only what the plaintiff needed by way of
    timely diagnosis and treatment in order to avoid injury, without considering
    the presence or absence of any breaches of the standard of care. It is not
    aimed at and does not determine fault. The second question is whether anyone in
    the chain of events caused or contributed to the delay, and determines fault.
    This is a conventional “but for” analysis of each individual’s involvement,
    which avoids giving any defendant the opportunity to make the “circular
    causation” argument. The “but for” test would be explained in the instructions
    and adapted to the facts, including the role of acts and omissions. There is accordingly
    no “global but for” test, just the application of the ordinary “but for” test
    in the context of a claim for delayed diagnosis in a medical negligence case
    involving multiple tortfeasors.</p>

    stated above,<span style='line-height:200%'> would have or could have resulted

    causation theories in this case were clearly and unambiguously put to the jury
    via the evidence and particularly the expert evidence, in jury submissions by
    the parties, in the trial judge’s explanation of the positions of the parties,
    and in her jury instructions. No one minced words. When contrasted with the
    answers the appellants asked the jury to make, the answers given by the jury
    demonstrate that even if the jury questions had been expressed differently, the
    jury would not have found in the appellants’ favour.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Professor Brown
    discussed the dynamic by which a trier of fact assesses competing causation
    theories and makes a choice in his 2011 article, at p. 57:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Specifically, fact-finders infer to the best <em>explanation</em> among a way of competing explanations of the evidence put before the parties. …
    At the first stage, parties offer competing narrative to account for the
    evidence (the plaintiff offering versions that address the formal doctrinal of
    requirements of her claim, and the defendant offering versions that omit at
    least one of those elements). The second stage sees the fact-finder subjecting
    those explanations (along with any explanations generated by the fact-finder
    herself) to consideration for plausibility in relation to the evidence. The
    fact-finders, in other words, attempt in situations of factual uncertainty,
    including known unknowns, to make sense of what happened by cobbling together a
    plausible account that qualifies as the most compelling of the accounts on
    offer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his 2010
    article, at p. 39, Professor Brown pointed out that there is a form of
    circularity to this reasoning structure, “in that the explanation and the
    underlying evidence are mutually reinforcing”. He observed: “The evidence under
    consideration justifies the belief that the explanation is correct, while the
    explanation is used to clarify the evidence”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not
    consider this element of circularity to be a flaw, but only a feature of the
    ordinary reasoning process. A person who comes upon a situation and tries to
    figure out what happened will, from the evidence, generate hypotheses, and will
    upon investigation and reflection reject some and eventually adopt one that
    makes the most sense of all of the evidence. The key link in finding cause-in-fact
    in a legal action, as Professor Brown noted, is that the trier of fact’s
    reasoning process of “constructing and comparing narratives is undertaken with
    reference to the evidence, free of idiosyncratic value judgments.” (p. 39)  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to
    set out the jury submissions by the parties, the trial judge’s explanation of
    the positions of the parties, her jury instructions, and the jury’s answers.</p>
  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Jury Addresses</h4>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(a) The Defence
    Addresses</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury heard first
    from counsel for the Sunnybrook defendants, but his address was not
    transcribed. The jury next heard from the counsel for the doctors, who said: “There’s
    two different competing causation theories, as you would have gathered from the
    evidence. … There’s a pretty clear dichotomy between what the defence experts
    say occurred.” He put the defence theory forward forcefully:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]nside his abdomen where the leak occurred infected his
    retroperitoneum, the back of his abdomen, which is in behind a lining which
    must have been breached, infection got in there, infected the muscles in his
    back and then tracked down, infected the muscles in his thigh, and that was a virulent
    infection and that was the reason why he got so sick. He didn’t get better
    after he had the surgery on May 17, he actually got worse.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>And it’s explained for that reason, whereas the plaintiff’s
    position is that – that just didn’t happen. The plaintiff says that didn’t
    happen. It was – the delay in getting him back to the operating room that is
    the cause.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel
    returned to the theme a number of times in his argument stating, at page 7: “You
    have to choose between two theories, one of which is a coherent consistent
    theory presented by the defence experts…versus kind of piece-meal different
    theories that changed as the trial went on” put forward by the plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After going
    through the evidence in detail, defence counsel said to the jury: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>What the defence says this represents, as a matter of science,
    is that, that necrotizing retroperitoneal soft tissue infection was destroying
    those muscles in his back, retroperitoneum, and thigh already on May 17, and it
    got a lot worse and stayed very bad for a number of days, and those are the
    same days that he is profoundly septically ill. He is in profound septic shock,
    those are the same days where he’s requiring massive amounts of vasopressors,
    which caused the peripheral ischemia, which is what causes his feet to go
    necrotic.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>So, this all ties it together, clearly, in our submission, that
    – what the defence is saying is – is right and proven by all this clinical
    data, and – and that – the plaintiffs’ experts have zero explanation to the
    contrary.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel submitted
    to the jury that the infection was not preventable on the evidence: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>There’s no causation in the case referable to the defendants’
    actions. And it’s because…it’s for this reason, the only witnesses who
    described that in detail were Dr. Davison and Dr. Zoutman [defence experts],
    and they both said this was not preventable, for a whole bunch of different
    reasons, but it was seeded by – early on, by the evening of the 16th, early
    morning of the 17th, and it – and you couldn’t stop that process, because no
    one knew about it.   </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b) The
    Plaintiffs’ Jury Address</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs’
    trial counsel took the approach that the outcome “represents a total failure of
    the entire healthcare team and all of its members and parts. It is a total
    systems failure.” (page 137-8)<span style='line-height:200%'> The argument
    depended on proving that, but for the collective delay in diagnosing and
    treating, Mr. Sacks’s injuries would have been prevented. The position was that
    if the “leak had been diagnosed on the evening of May 16, and he been taken to
    the operating room by 1:00 or 2:00 p.m. on May 17, as Dr. Smith testified that
    the standard of care required, he would not have progressed from infection to
    severe septic shock.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel
    went through the medical records at length and urged the jury to make specific
    findings that the doctors and staff of the hospital, and the hospital itself,
    had breached the standard of care in a number of ways.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel
    stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>And I say to you Dr. Lee [the plaintiffs’ expert] was entirely
    right, even on the late morning of May the 17th, Mr. Sacks’ outcome would have
    been avoided if only he had received the treatment that he should have…because
    the key is treat intra-abdominal sepsis as quickly as possible and before it
    leads to septic shock and that’s what didn’t happen for Jordan. His
    intra-abdominal sepsis was not treated and it did lead to septic shock, and I
    say to you that should be the end of the debate, because the delay that
    occurred, caused, or allowed, Jordan’s sepsis to progress to septic shock. The
    septic shock – I don’t think there’s any disagreement here, the septic shock caused
    Jordan’s injuries. So, if the delay caused the sepsis to go to septic shock,
    and septic shock caused the injuries, the delay caused the injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like defence
    counsel, plaintiffs’ counsel was clear and forceful:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The defendants say that Jordan developed a virulent aggressive
    necrotizing infection in his retroperitoneum that was then undiagnosed and
    untreated until at least June the 4th, I am going to suggest to you that that
    diagnosis is physiologic nonsense concocted eight years after the fact in an
    attempt to avoid accountability for their actions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel
    challenged strongly the expertise of the defence experts regarding necrotizing
    fasciitis. He went over the defence evidence in detail. He stated: “the simple
    reality is Jordan did not have retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis in May
    2008.” He invited the jury to so find: “I am going to ask you to find that
    Jordan did not have retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis in May of 2008.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for the
    existence of retroperitoneal necrotizing fasciitis, the theory advanced by
    trial counsel was that Mr. Sacks later “got a bug, <em>pseudomonas aeruginiosa</em>.”
    That bug “caused a secondary necrotizing soft tissue infection, and acute
    surgical emergency.”  In short, the plaintiff’s position was that the
    necrotizing fasciitis was a later development and would not have occurred had
    the sepsis been arrested by proper treatment on May 17.</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Jury Instructions</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her jury
    instructions, the trial judge went over the positions of the plaintiffs and the
    defence, which were prepared by them for insertion into the instructions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the very end
    of her instructions, just before reaching the jury questions, the trial judge summarized
    the expert evidence, which she had just reviewed:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The plaintiff experts, Dr. Giacomantonio, Dr. Smith, Dr.
    Rebello, and Dr. Lee and Dr. Krajdn, all said that Jordan’s complications
    following the surgery were caused by the breach of the standard of care of the
    defendants. The defendant physicians, and hospital, and nurses, called experts
    whose evidence I have just summarized: Dr. Davison, Dr. Stroz, Dr. Zoutman, and
    Nurse Burns, and they testified that Jordan’s outcome was not caused by
    anything the doctors and nurses, or the hospital, did or did not do, rather, it
    was related to the retroperitoneum necrotizing infection that Jordan developed
    May 16 or May 17.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    dealt with causation at several places in her jury instruction. She stated, at
    page 53:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In order to succeed the plaintiff must also satisfy you that
    but for the breach of the standard [of care] by one or more of the defendants,
    it is more likely than not that Jordan, would not have suffered septic shock
    and would not have had to undergo some 22 surgeries, including the amputations.
    This is known as the “causation issue”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She next
    returned to the issue in discussing the questions:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As I’ve told you, causation is established if the evidence
    satisfies you that it is more likely than not that Jordan would not have had
    the complications and injuries but for the negligent conduct of or breach of
    the standard of care,… [then]… you must go on to answer question 2b and provide
    how or in what way the doctor’s breach of the standard of care caused Jordan’s
    injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were no
    objections to the jury instruction.</p>
  <h4>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Jury’s Answers</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The competing
    causation theories were put clearly to the jury via the evidence and
    particularly the expert evidence, in jury submissions by the parties, in the
    trial judge’s expression of the positions of the parties, and in her jury
    instructions. The jury’s answers must be assessed in that light. The contending
    positions were sharply differentiated on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this section of the reasons I set out the flow of events in sequence. The
    jury’s answers must be measured against the findings requested by trial counsel
    for the appellants. To summarize, the jury found that five of the defendants
    breached the standard of care, but not Dr. Jeffery Singer nor Nurse Pamela
    Raye-Illogu. However, the jury did not find that any of the breaches of the
    standard of care by the defendants caused the injuries for which Mr. Sacks
    claimed compensation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sequence of
    relevant events started with Mr. Sacks’s surgery on May 13, 2008. Between then
    and early on May 16, 2008, when his condition started to deteriorate, he
    developed an anastomotic leak. The appellants do not allege that there was
    negligence in the surgery or in the fact that the anastomotic leak developed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against this
    backdrop, the first event to be assessed is Mr. Sacks’s presentation of pain
    and distended abdomen starting at 7:50 a.m. on May 16, when he was under the
    care of Nurse Raye-Ilogu. At 4:30 p.m. she informed Dr. Bendzsak and Dr. Kanji
    about Mr. Sacks’s pain.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning this
    event, with respect to Dr. Bendzsak, the jury was asked to find that she:</p>

  <p class=CQuote>In an action alleging delay in diagnosis and treatment, such as
