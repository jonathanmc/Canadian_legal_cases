  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Mario D. Faieta of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated March 4, 2016, with reasons reported at
    2016 ONSC 1444.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Huscroft J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal concerns the validity of a Community
    Treatment Order (“CTO”) made under the </span><em>Mental Health Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7 (“</span><em>MHA</em><span lang=EN-US>”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A CTO provides a person who has a serious mental
    disorder with treatment or care and supervision in the community, rather than
    in the confines of a psychiatric facility: </span><em>MHA</em> s. 33(3).<span
lang=EN-US> The CTO is based on a Community Treatment Plan (“CTP”), which must
    be entered into within 72 hours of an examination by the issuing physician. The
    question in this case is whether all participants in a CTP must sign it within
    72 hours of the examination in order for the CTO to be valid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Consent and Capacity Board answered that
    question in the negative. According to the Board, it was sufficient that Dr.
    Richard Gorman, the issuing physician who examined S.S., signed the CTP within
    72 hours of conducting the examination, even though some of the other
    participants in the plan, including the monitoring physician, Dr. Kantor,
    signed more than 72 hours later. The appeal judge allowed the appeal and set
    aside the CTO, holding that all participants in the CTP were required to sign
    it within the 72-hour period in order for the CTO to be valid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the appeal judge erred in doing so. I
    would allow the appeal for the reasons that follow.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>S.S. is a 63 year-old woman diagnosed with paranoid
    schizophrenia. She has been hospitalized or received hospital treatment on
    several occasions since 2007. Dr. Kantor is the consulting psychiatrist at
    Reconnect Mental Health Services, where S.S. is a client.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>S.S. was hospitalized at Toronto East General
    Hospital from April 7 to April 23, 2015, where she was found incapable with
    respect to psychiatric treatment with anti-psychotic medication and a CTP. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> On April 16, 2015, Dr. Gorman and the Community
    Mental Health Services Coordinator signed a CTP governing S.S.’s care. Dr.
    Kantor signed the CTP on April 20, 2015, the substitute decision-maker signed
    April 21, 2015, and Reconnect Mental Health Services signed April 22, 2015. On
    April 23, 2015, Dr. Gorman issued a CTO giving effect to the CTP. S.S. sought
    review of the finding of incapacity and challenged the issuance of the CTO
    before the Board. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board found that S.S. was incapable of
    consenting both to psychiatric treatment with anti-psychotic medication and to the
    CTP. The Board’s decision on this point was confirmed by the appeal judge and initially
    was not contested on this appeal. Subsequently, counsel for S.S. sought leave
    to raise several additional issues, including whether the incapacity finding was
    reasonable.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The legislation</span></h1>

    a CTP. The issuance of a CTP is governed by the </span><em>MHA</em><span

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(4)</span>&nbsp;A physician may issue or renew

    physician who is considering issuing or renewing the community treatment order
    and any other health practitioner or person involved in the person’s treatment
    or care and supervision have developed a community treatment plan for the
    person;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) within the 72-hour period before entering into the
    community treatment plan, the physician has examined the person and is of the
    opinion, based on the examination and any other relevant facts communicated to
    the physician, that,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(i) the person is suffering from mental disorder such that
    he or she needs continuing treatment or care and continuing supervision while
    living in the community,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(ii) the person meets the criteria for the completion of an
    application for psychiatric assessment under subsection 15 (1) or (1.1) where
    the person is not currently a patient in a psychiatric facility,</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(iii) if the person does not receive continuing treatment or
    care and continuing supervision while living in the community, he or she is
    likely, because of mental disorder, to cause serious bodily harm to himself or
    herself or to another person or to suffer substantial mental or physical
    deterioration of the person or serious physical impairment of the person,&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(iv) the person is able to comply with the community
    treatment plan contained in the community treatment order, and</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(v) the treatment or care and supervision required under the
    terms of the community treatment order are available in the community;&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(d) the physician has consulted with the health practitioners
    or other persons proposed to be named in the community treatment plan;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(e) subject to subsection (5), the physician is satisfied that
    the person subject to the order and his or her substitute decision-maker, if
    any, have consulted with a rights adviser and have been advised of their legal
    rights; and&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(f) the person or his or her substitute decision-maker consents
    to the community treatment plan in accordance with the rules for consent under
    the&nbsp;<em>Health Care Consent Act, 1996., </em><em><span style='font-style:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board found S.S. could understand the
    information relevant to making a decision about her psychiatric treatment.
    However, because of her lack of insight into her mental state and corresponding
    need for treatment, S.S. was unable to appreciate the consequences of a
    treatment decision. The Board therefore found S.S. incapable of consenting to
    treatment with anti-psychotic medication and incapable of consenting to a CTP. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board then considered the validity of the CTO.
    It reviewed each of the criteria governing the issuance of a CTO and confirmed
    that they were met. Concerning the 72-hour period, the Board stated, at p. 18: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Kantor’s evidence was that within the
    seventy-two hour period before entering into the Community Treatment Plan on
    April 16, 2015, in fact the same day as Dr. Gorman entered into the Plan, he
    examined SS and concluded that she suffered from mental disorder requiring
    continuing treatment and continuing supervision while living in the community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board accepted Dr. Kantor’s evidence and

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal judge upheld the finding of S.S.’s
    incapacity on the basis that it was reasonable. However, he applied a
    correctness test to the Board’s interpretation of the </span><em>MHA</em><span
lang=EN-US> and concluded that the Board erred in interpreting s. 33.1(4).
    According to the appeal judge, the </span><em>MHA</em><span lang=EN-US> requires not only the examining physician, but also all persons named in the
    CTP to agree in writing to the CTP within 72 hours of the medical examination. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Applying this requirement, the appeal judge
    found that the Public Guardian and Trustee (the substitute decision-maker for
    the appellant), Dr. Kantor, and Reconnect Mental Health Services did not sign the
    CTP until more than 72 hours had passed following S.S.’s medical examination.
    As a result, he concluded that the CTP did not meet the requirements of s.
    33.1(4), allowed the appeal, and set aside the CTO.</span></p>

    basis that the evidence did not satisfy the requirements set out in </span><em>Palmer

lang=EN-US>, at para. 35. No deference is owed to the Board on this issue. As
    noted above, the broad statutory right of appeal and adjudicative nature of the
    proceedings militate against deference. Furthermore, courts clearly have
    relative expertise on general questions of statutory interpretation. One of the
    stated purposes of the Act is to provide for the consistent application of its
    rules: s. 1. Consistency requires courts to ensure that individual panels do
    not diverge in their interpretation of statutory provisions. Finally, this
    question of law has broad application and need not be resolved anew on each
    appeal. A correctness standard of review on this issue will not impede the
    expeditious treatment of patients.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These provisions refer to the responsibilities
    of the physician issuing or renewing a CTO. Different statutory language is used
    in regard to the obligations of the other treatment/care providers named in the
    CTP, who are required only to indicate their agreement to the plan following
    consultation: </span><em>MHA</em><span lang=EN-US>, ss. 33.1(4)(d) and 33.5(3).</span></p>

    that the date on which any person other than the examining physician signed the
    CTP was irrelevant. The Board confirmed this position in holding that it was
    sufficient that Dr. Gorman, who examined S.S., signed the CTP within the
    72-hour window.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    or renewing physician confirms the purpose of s. 33.1(4). The 72-hour
    requirement is designed to ensure that the physician’s medical findings are fresh
    when the CTP is entered into <i>by the physician</i>. Not only does a
    requirement that other participants in the CTP sign it within 72 hours not
    further this purpose, it may well frustrate it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal judge found that the CTP was
    analogous to a contract. Applying contractual principles, he held that a
    physician did not “enter into” a CTP unless the other persons named in the plan
    agreed to that plan, and the requirement that those persons “indicate” their
    agreement with the plan means that they must all sign the CTP within 72 hours
    of the physician’s examination of the person for whom the plan was developed. </span></p>

    with a CTP are not parties to the CTP in a contractual sense. They are simply
    indicating that they agree to provide treatment or care under a CTP. They are
    not required to do so within a limited period of time: s. 33.5(3). Again, the 72-hour
    requirement relates to entry into the CTP by the physician.</span></p>

    familiar common law principles when interpreting complex administrative
    schemes, lest the administrative scheme be undermined. In this case, the appeal
    judge’s decision overturned an interpretation it appears the Board has long followed.
    The appeal judge’s decision would formalize the CTP, resulting in logistical
    difficulties and undermining patient care without any countervailing benefit.
    These difficulties led another appeal judge to reach the opposite conclusion, approving
    the Board’s interpretation of s. 33.1(4) and upholding the CTO in </span><em>Paspalovski

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, she argues the CTO is invalid because certain

    Second, she argues that her hearing before the Board was procedurally unfair. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>None of the additional issues have merit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dealing first with the requirements of s. 33.1(4),
    S.S. argues that Dr. Gorman did not properly examine her as required by s.
    33.1(4)(c); that the information grounding his incapacity finding was outdated;
    that he did not consult with other signatories to the CTP as required by s.
    33.1(4)(d); that she could not comply with the CTO; and that the Public
    Guardian and Trustee’s consent given on her behalf was invalid. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    is incapable of consenting to anti-psychotic treatment and to a CTP – a finding
    the appeal judge upheld – is properly the subject of a cross-appeal: see r.
    61.07. No cross-appeal was brought. Nor is this an appropriate case to grant
    leave to raise issues not stated in a notice of cross-appeal based on r.
    61.07(3). S.S. filed her motion for leave to raise additional issues only a few
    days before the hearing; the appellant did not have the opportunity to
    adequately respond to the issues raised and there is no material before the
    court justifying an extension of time to cross-appeal: see <i>Laudon v. Roberts</i>,
    2009 ONCA 383, 308 D.L.R. (4th) 422, at para. 59; <i>Mississauga (City) v.

    validity must also fail. The Board’s finding that the s. 33.1(4) requirements
    were met is a question of mixed fact and law, reviewed for reasonableness. The
    Board carefully considered the evidence before it and found that each of the
    criteria in s. 33.1(4) was met. The record amply supports the Board’s findings.
    There is no basis to conclude that the Board’s conclusion was unreasonable. </span></p>

    procedurally unfair because she was given insufficient notice of the case she
    had to meet. Her notice argument has two prongs. First, the documentary
    evidence the Board relied on – namely, the CTO – was vague and contained
    errors. Second, she argues that certain documents were provided to her for the
    first time at the hearing itself, giving her and her counsel insufficient time to
    review them. </span></p>

    received notice of the Board hearing. The hearing was adjourned twice,
