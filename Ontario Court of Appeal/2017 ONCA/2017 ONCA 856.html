  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on October 19, 2016
    by Justice Mitch Hoffman of the Ontario Court of Justice, sitting without a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>Laskin J.A.:</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a judge alone trial, the appellant, Darren Sim, was convicted of
    criminal harassment by engaging in threatening conduct contrary to s. 264(1)
    and (2)(d) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><i><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></b></span></i></span></a>.
    The conviction arose out of Sims creation of a private Yahoo! Group website,
    which portrayed the complainant in a false and sexually degrading manner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sim appeals his conviction. His sole ground of appeal is that the trial
    judge erred in finding that the unlawful act or <em>actus reus</em> of the
    offence had been established.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By any standard, Sims conduct was morally reprehensible.</p>
  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sims relationship with the complainant </h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sim met the complainant sometime around 2001, when he was almost 30
    years old. He worked in property maintenance in the complainants apartment building.
    Sim regularly saw the complainant around the building, and at one point invited
    her for coffee, an invitation she accepted. They developed a friendship and got
    together from time to time to watch a movie or go skating.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At some point Sim developed romantic feelings for the complainant, which
    he expressed to her. His feelings were not reciprocated. The two remained
    friends however, and continued to get together occasionally until 2003 or 2004.
    Then, the complainant decided she wanted to find a romantic partner, and
    realizing that Sim still harbored romantic feelings for her, told him it was
    best that they not see each other. Her decision disappointed and frustrated him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the years that followed, Sim and the complainant married other
    people, and each started a family.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later, Sim and the complainant began emailing each other a few times a
    year to provide brief updates on their respective lives and families. Around
    2009, Sim began asking the complainant for photos of herself, which she sent to
    him. </p>
  <h6>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sims Yahoo Group website</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November 2010, without the complainants consent, or even her
    knowledge, Sim created his Yahoo! Group website, which included an online
    internet forum dedicated, according to the websites home page, to the degradation
    and online spreading of the complainant. He recruited at least 150 members to
    his website.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sim posted extensive biographical details and photos of the complainant
    on the website. He authored false, degrading, vile, and grotesque sexualized
    commentary about her on the websites messaging forum. He encouraged group
    members to post their own vile comments about the complainant, to author and
    share crude sexual fantasies involving her, and to alter photographs of her in
    a sexually degrading way and share those as well. He also encouraged members to
    ejaculate on the pictures of the complainant he had posted, and to upload
    photos of these semen covered pictures to the website  all as part of a
    campaign to make the complainant look like the cock slobbering little slut she
    is.</p>
  <h6>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainants discovery of Sims Yahoo Group website</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    April 2013, the complainant received an email, which led to her discovery of
    Sims Yahoo! Group website. By then the website had over 1500 members. The
    email the complainant received contained a link to the websites home page. The
    complainant opened the link and was shocked and frightened by what she saw. The
    home page contained a picture of her from her wedding next to the caption CUM
    SLUT. The home page also listed biographical details of the complainant,
    including her name, age, weight, height, bra size, underwear size, hobbies,
    education, occupation, and number of children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following day, using a username and password created for her by a co-worker,
    the complainant gained full access to the website. She took screenshots of the
    home page, the photos of her, and the multiple perverted and sexual message strings
    about her. She took the screenshots to the police. Eventually Sim was charged
    with criminal harassment and publishing defamatory libel. He was convicted of
    the former charge and acquitted of the latter.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Discussion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection
    264(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> sets out the offence of criminal
    harassment, and s. 264(2) specifies that the conduct amounting to criminal
    harassment can be committed in one of four ways:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(1) <b>Criminal harassment</b>  No person shall,
    without lawful authority and knowing that another person is harassed or
    recklessly as to whether the other person is harassed, engage in conduct
    referred to in subsection (2) that causes that other person reasonably, in all
    the circumstances, to fear for their safety or the safety of anyone known to
    them.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) <b>Prohibited conduct</b>  The conduct mentioned
    in subsection (1) consists of </p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) repeatedly following from place to place the
    other person or anyone known to them;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) repeatedly communicating with, either directly
    or indirectly, the other person or anyone known to them;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(c) besetting or watching the dwelling-house, or
    place where the other person, or anyone known to them, resides, works, carries
    on business or happens to be; or</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(d) engaging in threatening conduct directed at
    the other person or any member of their family.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sim
    was convicted under paragraph (2)(d)  engaging in threatening conduct
    directed at the other person. In lengthy reasons, the trial judge found that
    the Crown had established the mental element or <em>mens rea</em> of the
    offence: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Crown has also established well beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the accuseds threatening conduct towards the complainant was done while
    he was at least reckless as to whether she was harassed. The <em>mens rea</em> of count one is made out as well.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sim
    does not challenge this finding. He does, however, challenge the trial judges
    finding that the <em>actus reus</em> had been made out. The trial judge found:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I have found that the <em>actus reus</em> of threatening has
    been made out on the basis of all the evidence I accept. In particular the
    accuseds recklessness at least about the link being made between the real-life
    [P.L.] and the on-line [P.L.]. As well as the recklessness about the
    complainant finding out about the home page and the whole website, as she
    eventually did.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sim
    submits that the trial judge erred in law in making this finding because establishing
    the <em>actus reus </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>of the offense</span></em> requires proof that the accused subjectively intended to engage in threatening
    conduct. The trial judge acknowledged that if the <em>actus reus</em> imports a
    requirement to prove an accuseds subjective intention, then Sim was entitled
    to be acquitted. But the trial judge held that there was no such requirement. I
    agree. For that reason, I do not accept Sims submission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Burns</em>, 2008 ONCA 6, 77 W.C.B. (2d) 402   relying on the
    judgment of the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal in <em>R. v. George</em>, 2002
    YKCA 2, 52 W.C.B. (2d) 530  this court endorsed an objective standard for
    determining the <em>actus reus</em> of harassment by engaging in threatening
    conduct. At para. 2, the court wrote: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>To establish harassment under s. 264(2)(d) of the Criminal
    Code, the Crown had to establish that the appellant engaged in threatening
    conduct. We accept the definition of threatening conduct given in <em>R. v.
    George</em> at para. 39 that, in order to meet the objectives of s. 264, the
    threatening conduct must amount to a tool of intimidation which is designed to
    instill a sense of fear in the recipient. The impugned conduct is to be viewed
    objectively, with due consideration for the circumstances in which they took
    place, and with regards to the effects those acts had on the recipient. [Citation

    support of his submission, Sim focuses on the word designed in the phrase
    tool of intimidation which is designed to instill a sense of fear in the
    recipient. I do not read this phrase or the word designed in the way Sim
    does for two main reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Sims submission is inconsistent with s. 264(1) of the <em>Code</em> and thus
    is contrary to Parliaments express intent. Subsection 264(1) specifies that
    the <em>mens rea</em> component of criminal harassment can be met by an
    accuseds knowledge or recklessness. To suggest that the <em>actus reus</em> of
    threatening conduct requires a specific intent to instil fear is contrary to
    the plain language of s. 264(1).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    as this court said in <em>Burns</em>, under s. 264(2)(d) the conduct in
    question must be viewed objectively. In other words, would the accuseds
    threatening conduct cause a reasonable person in the complainants situation to
    fear for her safety? The word designed does not require the Crown to prove
    the accuseds subjective intention. And, in assessing whether an accuseds
    conduct is threatening under s. 264(2)(d), a judge is not required to get into
    the accuseds mind.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the word designed is meant to focus on the effect of the accuseds conduct on
    a reasonable person in the shoes of the target of the conduct. In <em>Burns</em>,
    this court clarified that the objective assessment must consider the
    circumstances in which the conduct took place, and the effects that the conduct
    actually had on the complainant. Although an accused's threatening conduct may
    not affect every target of that conduct, in every conceivable situation, it
    could well instill fear in a reasonable person in the complainants specific situation,
    particularly when the actual effects of the conduct on the complaint are
    considered. That is the case here. The trial judge did not err in finding that
    the Crown had established the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence.</p>

    would dismiss the appeal.</p>
