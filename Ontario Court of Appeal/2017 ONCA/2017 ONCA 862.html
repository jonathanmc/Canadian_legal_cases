    by Justice William M. Le May of the Superior Court of Justice, with reasons
    reported at<i> </i><em>R. v. C.B</em><i>.</i>, 2015 ONSC 7554.</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom><strong>Simmons J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with two counts of sexual interference and two
    counts of sexual assault arising from two incidents that occurred during the
    summer of 2009. The complainant is the appellants half-sisters daughter. The
    appellant was living with the complainant and her mother, C.S., during the
    period in which the alleged sexual assaults occurred. The appellant was 33 at
    the time; the complainant was 14.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the first incident, the complainant alleged that the
    appellant got on a bed she was sleeping in and digitally penetrated her during
    the second night of a two-night family stay in a hotel in Sault Ste. Marie (the
    hotel incident). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified at trial and denied any sexual misconduct with
    the complainant. The trial judge acquitted the appellant of the two charges
    relating to the hotel incident. He said he did not believe the appellants
    evidence due to credibility problems in the appellants evidence as a whole.
    Nonetheless, the trial judge concluded that the appellants evidence together
    with the whole of the evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt in relation to
    these charges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant alleged that the second incident occurred soon after
    their return from Sault Ste. Marie. On an occasion when the appellant was in
    the basement doing his laundry, she told the appellant that she was thinking
    about boys and sex, and stated that she was horny. The appellant told her to
    finger herself. Then, at her invitation, the appellant digitally penetrated her
    and performed oral sex on her until she told him to stop (the laundry room
    incident).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant denied any sexual misconduct with the complainant,
    he acknowledged telling the complainant to finger herself after she told him
    she was horny (the laundry room conversation). During cross-examination, the
    appellant asserted that he did not tell C.S. about the laundry room
    conversation because he was concerned that a big commotion might ensue,
    similar to a previous argument following which the complainant threatened to
    kill herself and harm other people.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found the appellant guilty of
    sexual assault and sexual interference in relation to the laundry room
    incident.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Among other things, he concluded that if there was any truth to the appellants
    assertions that he did not commit these offences or that the laundry room conversation
    was awkward, the appellant would have at least considered one of three courses
    of action, including telling C.S. about his conversation with the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On behalf of the appellant, duty counsel argued
    that the trial judge erred in his credibility analysis by failing to advert to
    material evidence when assessing the appellants credibility. In particular, he
    submits that the trial judge failed to advert to the appellants plausible
    explanation concerning why he did not tell C.S. about the laundry room conversation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial. &nbsp;Given this
    disposition of the appeal, it is unnecessary that I address the oral arguments
    advanced by the appellant.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To provide context for my review of the trial
    judges reasons, I will briefly set out some of the evidence he reviewed concerning
    the parties living arrangements, the appellant, the complainant, the two
    incidents and a Facebook conversation between the complainant and the appellant
    that preceded the charges. Although the appellant was acquitted of the hotel
    incident, the trial judges analysis of the hotel evidence is a component of
    his overall credibility analysis. I will also review the appellants evidence
    concerning why he did not tell C.S. about the laundry room conversation.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties living arrangements</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In March 2009, C.S. invited the appellant to
    move into a house with her, another of her brothers and the complainant. The
    appellant, C.S. and C.S.s other brother all had upstairs bedrooms; the
    complainant had a curtained-off bedroom in the basement near the laundry room. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was working for a trucking company
    when he moved in with C.S. and the complainant. He was fired from that job in
    August 2009 and remained unemployed for a few weeks. In December 2009, the
    appellant moved to Ottawa abruptly without giving notice that he was leaving. Following
    the appellants departure, C.S. cashed one of his cheques from his employer.
    Although she left the appellant a note, he called the police. The police
    investigated but did not lay charges. The appellant eventually recovered the
    amount of the cheque from his employer by telling his employer the cheque had
    been stolen.</span></p>

    2009. She suffered from depression as a child and, prior to the incidents at
    issue, was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and anti-social personality
    disorder. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly before the hotel incident, the
    complainant began taking a new medication that made her drowsy. During
    cross-examination, she acknowledged that if she did not take her medication,
    her judgment could become impaired, she could become hyperactive and could possibly
    experience hallucinations.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The hotel incident</span></h4>

    complainant went on a road trip to Sault Ste. Marie. They stopped on the way
    and picked up C.S.s nephew, D. The foursome stayed in Sault Ste. Marie in one
    hotel room for two nights. The complainant described the hotel room as
    containing a bathroom to the right of  the entrance and then two double beds on
    the right side of the room. The complainant and her cousin planned to share one
    bed, with the appellant and C.S. sharing the other. However, the sleeping
    arrangements did not proceed as planned.</span></p>

    appellant provided conflicting accounts of the sleeping arrangements. C.S.
    testified that the appellant slept on the floor both nights. The complainant
    testified that on the second night, her mother moved from the first bed next to
    the bathroom to the second bed, and the appellant fell onto the floor between
    the first bed and the bathroom wall. The complainant moved to the now-empty
    first bed. The appellant testified that on the first night, he slept on the
    floor between the bed and the bathroom wall. On the second night he slept in a
    bed with C.S. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant asserted that the appellant
    sexually assaulted her during the second night of the trip. According to her,
    during the night the appellant began to play with her hand. Then he got up on
    the bed and inserted his finger into her vagina. The appellant denied that any
    sexual misconduct occurred. When the complainant got into the bed next to him,
    he attempted to annoy her by making various noises and she attempted to hit him
    on the head. </span></p>

    said there were other aspects of the appellants testimony that supported his rejection

    taken as a whole, raised a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then turned to this question whether
    the evidence, when considered as a whole, raised a reasonable doubt. He began
    by observing, at para. 105, that the complainants credibility was enhanced by
    her evidence about the Facebook exchange whereas the appellants credibility
    was weakened. This was because the complainant acknowledged that the printed
    copy of the Facebook exchange adduced at trial was incomplete whereas the
    appellant initially attempted to avoid acknowledging he was involved in the

    room incident, the trial judge observed at para. 106, that the complainant and
    the appellant agreed on many aspects of the event. It was insignificant that
    the complainant and appellant described the timing of the laundry room incident
    differently. While they pointed to different months, both described the
    incident as occurring at the end of the summer, in either August, according to the
    complainant, or September, according to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    specific basis for rejecting the appellants evidence concerning the laundry
    room incident and for accepting the complainants evidence beyond a reasonable
    doubt:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>On cross-examination, [the appellant] stated
    that having a conversation with the Complainant about the fact that she was
    horny would have been awkward. However he did not take any steps to try and

    uncle and she is only 14 years old.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>If there was any semblance of reality to [the
    appellants] statement that he did not perform digital penetration or oral sex
    on the Complainant or that he found a conversation with the Complainant about
    sex awkward, then it is likely he would have at least thought about taking
    one of the steps. When these facts are considered against the backdrop of the
    evidence as a whole, I am of the view that the fact that the assault took place
    in the laundry room is proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then went on, at para. 109 of
    his reasons, to identify an aspect of the complainants evidence that
    reinforced his finding of guilt:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>My conclusion is enhanced by the exchange that
    [the appellants] counsel had with the Complainant near the end of her second

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On behalf of the appellant, duty counsel argued
    that lynchpin of the trial judges reasons for rejecting the appellants
    evidence concerning the laundry room incident is found at paras. 107 and 108 of
    his reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As set out above, in those paragraphs, the trial
    judge noted that the appellant testified that having a conversation with the
    complainant in which she said she was horny was awkward. Nonetheless, the
    appellant failed to do anything about the conversation, including telling the
    complainants mother about it, breaking off contact with the complainant or
    telling the complainant her comments were inappropriate. The trial judge concluded
    that if there was any truth to the appellants assertion that he did not engage
    in sexual misconduct with the complainant or that he found their laundry room
    conversation awkward, the appellant would have at least considered one of those
    three courses of action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Duty counsel submits that in reaching this
    conclusion, the trial judge failed to consider the whole of the evidence and
    therefore materially misapprehended the evidence. In particular, the trial
    judge failed to advert to the appellants explanation that he did not tell C.S.
    about the conversation because he was concerned that a big commotion would
    ensue and that the complainant might harm herself or others as a result.  Given
    the complainants history of mental illness and her evidence about being
    bullied, duty counsel submitted that the appellants explanation was plausible.
    Moreover, the trial judges failure to advert to, or make any findings
    concerning, the appellants explanation undermines what was the fundamental
    basis for rejecting the appellants evidence concerning the laundry room
    incident. Although the trial judge gave other reasons for rejecting the
    appellants evidence, paras. 107 to 108 were clearly the lynchpin of his
    credibility analysis concerning the laundry room incident. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown disputes duty counsels assertions
    that paras. 107 to 108 formed the lynchpin of the trial judges credibility findings
    concerning the laundry room incident. The trial judge gave many reasons for not
    accepting the appellants evidence and had already made it clear, at paras. 102
    and 103 of his reasons, that he rejected the appellants evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, the Crown submits that any failure
    to advert to the appellants explanation concerning why he did not tell C.S.
    about the laundry room conversation does not amount to a misapprehension of the
    evidence constituting reversible error. When making credibility findings, a
    trial judge need only explain the basis of his or her findings. Trial judges
    are not obliged to refer to every explanation advanced by an accused person
    when making findings of credibility. </span></p>

    submission that, before reaching paras. 107 to 108, the trial judge had already
    rejected the appellants evidence at paras. 102 and 103. Viewed in isolation,
    paras. 102 and 103 may appear to reflect a rejection of the appellants
    evidence. However, unlike paras. 107 to 108, the reasons given at that stage
    for purportedly rejecting the appellants evidence were general in nature and
    seem to apply to the appellants evidence as a whole rather than to either of
    the specific incidents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>More importantly, in the opening section of
    para. 98 of his reasons, the trial judge stated that the [appellants]
    evidence and the evidence taken as a whole raised a reasonable doubt
    concerning whether the interplay between the complainant and the appellant
    during the hotel incident included a sexual assault or sexual touching. In
    itemizing his reasons for this finding, the trial judge noted that the evidence
    concerning the sleeping arrangements in the hotel room was sufficiently
    unclear that he could not determine with any level of certainty who was
    sleeping where on each of the two nights. Given that C.S.s evidence supported
    the complainants assertion that the appellant slept on the floor the second
    night, the trial judge must have relied, at least in part, on the appellants
    evidence. Had the trial judge rejected all of the appellants evidence, then
    there would be no dispute as to the sleeping arrangements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    contributed to reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In these circumstances, the trial judges
    general credibility findings, set out at paras. 102 and 103 of his reasons,
    cannot be read as a rejection of the whole of the appellants evidence. As I

    force of the statements made at paras. 102 and 103. Second, in contrast to the

    that credibility assessment can there a case for miscarriage of justice.<a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    such an alleged misapprehension involves a failure to allude to specific
    evidence, the claim can only succeed if the failure to allude to evidence
    demonstrates that the trial was unfair and the verdict was not a true verdict: <em>Morrissey</em>, at pp. 538-540.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the central issue in relation to the laundry room incident was
    credibility. And while the trial judge gave several reasons for at least
    purportedly rejecting the appellants evidence, and therefore concluding it did
    not raise a reasonable doubt, for the reasons I have explained, paras. 107 to
    108 of his decision are the lynchpin of his credibility assessment in relation
    to that incident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    those paragraphs, the trial judge said that had there been any air of reality
    to the appellants evidence that he did not engage in sexual misconduct or that
    he found the laundry room conversation awkward, the appellant would have at
    least considered taking one of three steps. Those steps were telling C.S. about
    the conversation, ceasing conduct with the complainant or telling her that her
    comments were inappropriate. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a starting point, the appellant never specifically described the conversation
    as awkward. More importantly, in reaching this conclusion the trial judge did
    not refer to the appellants explanation that he did not tell C.S. about the
    laundry room conversation out of concern that it would have led to a
    commotion between the complainant and her mother, which could have, in turn,
    caused harm to the complainant. Having regard to the complainants own evidence
    about her mental health, the appellants explanation was not implausible on its
    face. However, nowhere in his reasons did the trial judge refer to the
    appellants explanation. And although the explanation was given in response to
    a specific question concerning why the appellant did not speak to C.S., it was
    also capable of explaining why the appellant may not have adopted the other
    courses of action to which the trial judge referred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge gave lengthy reasons in which he summarized and
    analyzed the relevant evidence. Considered in this light, and given the facial
    plausibility of the appellants explanation, in my view, the failure of the
    trial judge to refer to this evidence constitutes a misapprehension of the
    evidence giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. The fact that the trial judge
    gave additional reasons at paras. 105 and 109 explaining why he found the
    complainant credible, and concluded at para. 105 that the appellants
    credibility was weakened by the Facebook evidence does not detract from this
    conclusion. Paragraphs 107 to 108 were the lynchpin of the trial judges
    reasons for rejecting the appellants evidence. The trial judges failure to
    refer to the appellants evidence explaining why he did not act in the manner
    the trial judge would have anticipated undermines the logic and cogency of the
    trial judges reasoning.</p>
