  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from acquittals entered by Justice Robert T.
    Knott of the Ontario Court of Justice on March 2, 2017.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was charged with sexual assault and related offences.  The
    trial judge acquitted on all counts.  The Crown appeals. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.M., the complainant, <span lang=EN-US>described two sexual assaults
    committed by the respondent, her biological father.  The incidents allegedly
    occurred about two weeks apart, some 10 or 11 years earlier when E.M. was 10 or
    11 years old.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On the evidence, E.M. and the respondent had no
    relationship for the first 10 years of E.M.’s life.  Eventually, she learned of
    her father and was introduced to him.  Her mother arranged for E.M. to spend
    time with the respondent on alternate weekends over several weeks.  E.M.
    testified that she was sexually assaulted on two separate occasions during those
    visits. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>There was uncertainty in the evidence, explained in
    part by the fact that the relevant events occurred about 11 years earlier,
    about the timing of the various visits by E.M. to the respondent, and the overall
    time period during which those visits occurred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>E.M. testified that both sexual assaults<span lang=EN-US> occurred after her birthday, which was January 12<sup>th</sup> when she turned
    11, but before the respondent suffered a serious eye injury, requiring him to
    wear a patch over one eye.  Independent evidence showed that the respondent
    suffered the eye injury on January 6, 2006.  Consequently, the sexual assaults
    could not have occurred before the eye injury on January 6<sup>th</sup>, but
    after E.M.’s birthday on January 12<sup>th</sup>.  This part of E.M.’s evidence
    was clearly wrong.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent did not testify.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the Crown and the respondent agree that
    E.M.’s evidence placing the alleged assaults between the date the respondent
    suffered an eye injury and her 11th birthday could not have been accurate. 
    Both also agree that this feature of E.M.’s evidence had to be taken into
    account in assessing the overall reliability of her evidence.  The respondent
    argued that this was a crucial feature of E.M.’s evidence that spoke strongly
    against the reliability of her evidence.  The trial judge understood this
    submission and took this aspect of E.M.’s evidence into account in assessing
    the reliability of her evidence (see reasons, at p. 16).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown submits, however, that the trial judge went
    further than using this part of E.M.’s evidence in assessing the reliability of
    her testimony.  The Crown argues that the trial judge treated the timeframe
    alleged in the indictment (and later amended) as an essential element of the
    offence, essentially part of the </span><em>actus reus</em><span lang=EN-US>, to
    be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At least three comments in the trial judge’s reasons support the Crown’s
    position that the trial judge did treat the time within which the offences occurred
    as an essential element of the offence (see reasons, at pp. 2, 13 and 19).  For
    example, at p. 19, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I cannot, with any certainty, and certainly
    not beyond a reasonable doubt, say [in] what timeframe the incident could have occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> As a general rule, the Crown is not required to
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged offence occurred within the
    timeframe set down in the indictment: see </span><em>R. v. B. (G.)</em><span
lang=EN-US> (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 200, at 215-16 (SCC); </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span lang=EN-US>, s. 601(4.1).  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is nothing inherent in the nature of the charges
    brought against the respondent that would make the time at which those offences
    occurred an essential element of the offence.  For example, this is not a case
    in which the evidence raised the possibility that if the acts were committed at
    a certain time, they were no longer criminal because of the age of the
    complainant.  The conduct alleged in this case remained criminal regardless of
    when it occurred.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent contends that this case falls
    within that category of cases in which fairness to the accused demands that the
    Crown be required to prove that the offence occurred within the timeframe
    alleged in the indictment.  Broadly speaking, these are cases in which an
    accused can demonstrate a prejudice to his or her ability to properly defend
    the case flowing from the Crown’s attempt to prove that the offences occurred
    at some time outside of the time period alleged in the indictment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not accept that the respondent was
    prejudiced in the relevant sense by a finding that the assaults occurred
    outside of the timeframe alleged in the indictment.  The respondent had clear
    notice of the legal and factual nature of the allegations and the factual
    context in which they were said to have occurred.  The Crown maintained that
    the respondent sexually assaulted his daughter on two occasions during the
    weekend visits that occurred on alternate weekends over several weeks.  The
    actual dates of the alleged offences, or the timeframe within which they
    occurred, added nothing that would assist the respondent in identifying the
    allegations.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor did the timeframe have anything to do with
    the defence advanced by the respondent.  Although the respondent did not
    testify, it was the defence position that the alleged assaults did not occur
    and that E.M. was not a reliable witness.  That defence in no way depended on,
    or took its shape from, the timing of the alleged sexual assaults.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is not a case in which an accused advanced
    an alibi-like defence in response to the timeframe alleged by the Crown in the
    indictment, only to have the Crown argue for a conviction based on events
    outside of the timeframe.  There is simply no reason to think that the defence
    advanced here hinged in any way on the timeframe alleged in either the original
    indictment or the amended indictment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a related argument, the respondent argues
    that he was prejudiced by the amendment to the indictment at the end of the
    Crown’s case.  The Crown appreciated that the complainant’s evidence as to the
    timeframe could not be correct.  For reasons that are not entirely clear, the Crown
    sought to amend the indictment to limit the timeframe alleged to the period
    before the respondent suffered his eye injury.  The trial judge amended the

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This argument is essentially a reformulation of
    the unfairness argument.  The question remains – can the respondent demonstrate
    any unfairness to the defence should the Crown be allowed to rely on events
    outside of the timeframe alleged in the indictment as amended?  As pointed out
    above, the defence did not turn on the timeframe in the indictment.  It turned
    on the reliability of E.M.’s evidence.  Neither the substance of the
    respondent’s argument that her evidence was unreliable, nor the potential force
    of that argument, was affected by the amendment to the indictment.  Whatever
    the timeframe alleged in the indictment, it was clear that E.M.’s recollection
    as to when the alleged assaults occurred was in error.  The impact of that
    error on the reliability of her evidence had nothing to do with the timeframe
    alleged in the indictment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are satisfied that the Crown did not have to
    prove that the alleged offences occurred within the timeframe alleged in the
    indictment.  Having regard to the reasons as a whole, we conclude that the
    trial judge did treat the timeframe alleged in the indictment as an essential
    element of the offence.  The final words in his reasons make that clear:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I cannot say that the incidents occurred
    between November 25, 2005 and January 5, 2006.  The accused will be found not
    guilty. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge erred in law in requiring the
    Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offences occurred within the
    timeframe alleged in the indictment.  The error was crucial.  The trial judge expressed
    concerns about the reliability of E.M.’s evidence.  The concerns were based in
    part on her clearly erroneous recollection of when the offences occurred.  The
    trial judge did not, however, come to any conclusion as to the reliability of E.M.’s
    evidence, but instead wrongly decided the case on the ground that the Crown had
    failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence occurred within the
    timeframe alleged in the indictment.  It may well be that a trial judge would
    find E.M.’s evidence sufficiently reliable to satisfy the Crown’s burden of
    proof.  There must be a new trial on all charges.  </span></p>
