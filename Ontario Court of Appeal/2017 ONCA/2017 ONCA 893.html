  <p class=Onappealfrom><em>Charter - Freedom of religion - Request for
    accommodation from school board - Parent's desire to shield children from false
    teachings.</em></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Sharpe J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant E.T. is the father of two primary school-aged children who
    attend a school within the jurisdiction of the respondent Hamilton-Wentworth
    District School Board (the “Board”). E.T. is a committed Christian and a member
    of the Greek Orthodox Church. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advised the Board that his religious beliefs require him
    to shelter his children from what his religion regards as “false teachings”. He
    provided the Board with a standard form list of topics that included matters
    such as “moral relativism”, “environmental worship”, “instruction in sex
    education”, and “discussion or portrayals of homosexual/bisexual conduct and
    relationships and/or transgenderism as natural, healthy or acceptable”. He
    asked the Board to provide him with advance notice of any classroom instruction
    or discussion of these issues so that he could decide whether or not to
    withdraw his children from those classes or activities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board offered to exempt the appellant’s children from the “Healthy
    Living” strand in the elementary program, which is offered as a discrete part
    of the curriculum and involves education on human development and sexual
    health. However, the Board explained to the appellant that its Equity Policy
    aims to provide an integrated secular and respectful learning environment that
    does not discriminate against any child. The Board’s program aims to promote a
    positive and inclusive environment that accepts all pupils, including those of
    any sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression. The Board
    advised E.T. that, given the integrated nature of its program and the
    generality of the items on his list, it was neither practical nor possible to
    comply with his request for prior notification of any time one of the items on
    his list would arise for discussion in the classroom. The Board also expressed
    the concern that if E.T.’s children were required to leave the classroom every
    time one of these topics came up for discussion, the Board’s policy of
    providing an inclusive and non-discriminatory program would be undermined. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T. brought this application seeking declaratory relief, asserting that
    his parental authority over the education of his children had been denied and
    that his freedom of religion as guaranteed under s. 2(<em>a</em>) of the <em>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</em> was violated by the Board’s failure to provide him
    with the accommodation he requested. He also asserted a claim of religious
    discrimination under the <em>Human Rights Code</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19 and a
    violation of the <em>Education Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.2. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T.’s application rested on the general assertion that the Board’s
    policies and decisions violated his religious freedom. He provided no evidence
    of any actual instance where his or his children’s religious freedom had been
    violated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T. appeals the application judge’s determination that, while the Board’s
    refusal to provide the accommodation he requested engaged his religious
    freedom, the Board’s refusal to provide accommodation was reasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal on the ground that
    E.T. has failed to establish any interference with or violation of his
    religious freedom. </p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>FACTS AND BACKGROUND</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s Equity Policy and Accommodation Process</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time the application was filed, E.T.’s children attended one of
    the Board’s elementary schools. The Board oversees 103 schools of which 88 are
    elementary schools attended by over 34,000 pupils. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In carrying out its responsibilities, the Board is required to comply
    with the <em>Education Act</em> and regulations authorized thereunder, as well
    as ministerial directives and policies, and the policies the Board itself
    promulgates. The central statutory objectives relevant to this appeal are
    neutrality in matters of religion, inclusion in the school community and
    student well-being. Section 169.1(1) of the <em>Education Act</em> requires
    schools to promote a climate that is inclusive and accepting of all pupils,
    including pupils of any race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin,
    citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
    expression, age, marital status, family status or disability. Further, the
    Ministry of Education has issued several directives to school boards and
    principals regarding the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusive
    education: <em>Realizing the Promise of Diversity: Ontario’s Equity and
    Inclusive Education Strategy, 2009</em> (“EIES”), the Policy/Program Memorandum
    No. 119: <em>Developing and Implementing Equity and Inclusive Education
    Policies in Ontario Schools</em>, June 24, 2009, (“PPM No. 119”), and the <em>Equity
    and Inclusive Education in Ontario Schools: Guidelines for Policy Development
    and Implementation, 2009</em> (“EIEOS”). In response to and in accordance with these
    directives, the Board developed its own Equity Policy No. 1.01 (the “Policy”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These directives and policies are all designed to combat racism,
    religious intolerance and homophobia, and to ensure that all students feel
    welcome and accepted in public schools. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Students are to be provided with learning materials that are bias-free
    and that reflect the diversity of the school’s population, including diversity
    of sexual orientation and gender identity. A central feature of the Policy is
    that diversity, anti-discrimination and anti-homophobia are not taught in
    stand-alone lessons but rather are fully integrated into the curriculum so that
    acceptance of difference becomes routine. For example, teaching materials for a
    lesson in mathematics might feature children with two fathers or two mothers.
    In this way, all courses are infused with equity principles and teachers are
    directed to ensure that all students—including lesbian, gay, bisexual,
    transgender, transsexual, two spirited, intersex, queer and questioning people—will,
    in the words of the EIES, be “engaged, included, and respected, and … see
    themselves reflected in their learning environment”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The religious accommodation guideline included in the Board’s Policy states
    that the Board will “seek to reasonably accommodate students where there is a
    demonstrated conflict between a specific class or curriculum and a religious
    requirement or observance.” Where a parent requests such an accommodation, “the
    school should have an informed discussion with the student’s parents/guardians
    to understand the nature and extent of the conflict.” The aim of the Board’s
    religious accommodation guideline is “to protect students … from harassment and
    discrimination because of their religion” but the Policy makes it clear that
    the Board “cannot accommodate religious values and beliefs that clearly
    conflict with mandated Ministry of Education and Board policies”. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T.’s request for accommodation</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T. holds a sincere religious belief that he is obliged to shield his
    children from what his religion regards as “false teachings”, and to ensure
    that his children are taught about marriage and human sexuality from a
    perspective that is consistent with his understanding of biblical and Greek
    Orthodox teachings. These teachings include the following: sexual relations
    should only be between a man and a woman within the sacred institution of
    marriage; same-sex relations are contrary to God’s will; and there are only two
    genders, male and female. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Using a standard form request provided by Public Education Advocates for
    Christian Equality (“PEACE”), E.T. asked the Board to provide him with advance
    notice any time his children would be involved in or exposed to activities or
    instruction on a list of matters including the following:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Values
    neutral education - indoctrination of students in ‘moral relativism’ and
    principles of situational ethics. This ‘ism’ is a central tenet of the religion
    of secular humanism;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    Judeo-Christian principles and human life;</p>

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Discussion
    or portrayals of sexual conduct that we determine to be unnatural/unhealthy
    (anal sex, oral sex, masochism, bestiality, fetish, bondage, etc.);</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Discussion
    or portrayals of homosexual/bisexual conduct and relationships and/or
    transgenderism as natural, healthy or acceptable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board engaged in a series of discussions with E.T. extending over a
    two-year period. These included a lengthy meeting between E.T., the school
    principal and the Board’s Principal of Organizational Leadership-Equity. After
    considering E.T.’s requests and reviewing the matter with its equity
    consultant, the Board maintained its refusal of the accommodation E.T.
    requested. In these discussions with E.T., it became clear that his concerns were
    focused on issues pertaining to sexual orientation. He indicated that he did
    not object to his children being taught “facts” about such matters but he did
    object to his children being exposed to views or “value judgments” that did not
    match “his worldview”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board indicated that it could excuse E.T.’s children from the human
    development and sexual health segment of the curriculum. However, the Board
    advised E.T. that, given its commitment to creating schools that are safe,
    respectful and supportive of all, where diversity is valued and everyone feels
    accepted, it could not otherwise accommodate his request. As the Board’s Equity
    Principal explained in an affidavit filed on the application:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The message to classmates if E.T.’s request was accepted, is
    not tolerance but rather that family structures or discussion of sexual
    orientation will require the withdrawal of a student from the classroom. This
    cannot be reconciled with the Board’s legal obligations with respect to human
    rights and tolerance. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it was unable to provide the accommodation E.T. had requested, the
    Board suggested that E.T. might consider enrolling his children in a public
    Catholic school or a private Christian school or homeschooling them. </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ruling of the application judge</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge gave detailed and considered reasons for
    dismissing the application. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He found that a declaration of E.T.’s parental authority over his
    children’s education should not be granted on the ground that a “black-and-white”
    declaration of parental authority in favour of the appellant would oversimplify
    a nuanced point in the application of settled common law principles and would
    not serve any useful purpose. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found that E.T. had demonstrated a sincerely held
    religious belief, particularly in relation to marriage and sexuality, which was
    at odds with the Board’s Policy, and that there was an interference with his
    religious beliefs that was neither trivial nor insubstantial. However, applying
    the framework established by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Doré v. Barreau
    du Québec</em>, 2012 SCC 12, [2012] S.C.R. 395 and <em>Loyola High School v.
    Québec</em>, 2015 SCC 12, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 613, the application judge concluded
    that the Board’s refusal to provide E.T. with the accommodation he requested
    was not unreasonable. The application judge found that Board had taken account
    of the claim of religious freedom and had reasonably concluded that any
    constraint of E.T.’s religious freedom was proportionate and no more than
    necessary given the applicable statutory objectives. The application judge
    noted that other options, including independent schools and homeschooling,

  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ANALYSIS </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin my analysis by pointing to what I consider to be a central and
    fatal shortcoming in the case E.T. presented to the application judge and to
    this court, namely the lack of any concrete evidence of interference with his
    right to religious freedom.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T.’s children have now been pupils at a Board school for several
    years. E.T. first requested accommodation for his religious beliefs in
    September 2010. This application was filed in September 2012. When directly
    asked on cross-examination in November 2012, E.T. was unable to point to any
    evidence demonstrating that any “false teachings” had in fact been presented to
    his children. The matter was heard by the application judge in June 2016 and
    decided in November 2016. Despite the fact that almost six years had passed
    between the date E.T. first made his request for accommodation and the date the
    application was heard, E.T. could offer no evidence or any example of a single
    incident where his or his children’s religious freedom was constrained. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that E.T. has a sincere religious belief that he has an
    obligation to keep his children from being exposed to what he describes as “false
    teachings”. This sincere belief was the basis on which the application judge
    found that the Board’s Policy and its denial of the requested accommodation
    engaged the <em>Charter</em> by limiting its protections under s. 2(<em>a</em>)
    for E.T. and his children. However, a sincere religious belief alone is
    insufficient to establish interference with E.T.’s freedom of religion. An
    infringement of the right to religious freedom “cannot be established without
    objective proof of an interference with the observance of that practice” (<em>S.L.
    v. Commission scolaire des Chênes</em>, 2012 SCC 7, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 235, at para.
    2). The claimant must also demonstrate that the Board’s decision burdened or
    interfered with his sincerely held beliefs in more than a trivial or
    insubstantial way: <em>Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem</em>, 2004 SCC 47, [2004]
    2 S.C.R. 551, at paras. 57-59. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T.’s claim rests upon his general and pervasive dissatisfaction with
    the nature of the Board’s curriculum with respect to matters of equity,
    non-discrimination and inclusiveness. However, he has not proved a single
    instance where his children were coerced to do something that was contrary to
    his or their religious beliefs or where they were denied the right to manifest
    or observe their religion as they wished. Nor has he provided any evidence that
    his right to inculcate his children with his own religious views has been
    curtailed or infringed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T.’s complaint is that, given the very nature of the Board’s
    curriculum, his children may be exposed to views with which he, for religious
    reasons, does not agree. In my view, the jurisprudence from the Supreme Court of
    Canada makes it clear that exposing students who are attending
    non-denominational public schools to ideas that may challenge or even
    contradict their parent’s sincerely-held religious beliefs does not amount to
    an infringement of religious freedom. As the Attorney General puts it in his
    factum, “requiring students in public school to gain an awareness of Canada’s
    diverse reality is not a substantial infringement of religious freedom.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>S.L. v. Commission scolaire des Chênes</em>, parents asked to
    have their children exempted from Quebec’s mandatory Ethics and Religious
    Culture (“ERC”) Program that had replaced Catholic and Protestant programs of
    religious and moral instruction. The parents objected that the ERC Program
    would expose their children to “a form of relativism, which would interfere
    with [their] ability to pass their faith on to their children” (at para. 29)
    because it presented different beliefs on an equal footing. The Supreme Court
    accepted the sincerity of the parents’ religiously based objection to the
    nature of the ERC program, but held that sincerity of belief was insufficient
    to make out a s. 2(<em>a</em>) <em>Charter </em>claim of infringement of
    religious freedom. Writing for the seven-judge majority, Deschamps J. accepted,
    at para. 26, that “[t]he appellants sincerely believe that they have an
    obligation to pass on the precepts of the Catholic religion to their children”
    but she then held, at para. 27, that “[t]o discharge their burden at the stage
    of proving an infringement, the appellants had to show that, from an objective
    standpoint, the ERC Program interfered with their ability to pass their faith
    on to their children.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deschamps J. rejected the assertion that exposing children to contrary
    views, without more, amounts to an infringement of freedom of religion, at
    para. 40:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Parents are free to pass their personal beliefs on to their
    children if they so wish. However, the early exposure of children to realities
    that differ from those in their immediate family environment is a fact of life
    in society. The suggestion that exposing children to a variety of religious
    facts in itself infringes their religious freedom or that of their parents
    amounts to a rejection of the multicultural reality of Canadian society and
    ignores the Quebec government’s obligations with regard to public education. Although
    such exposure can be a source of friction, it does not in itself constitute an
    infringement of s. 2(<em>a</em>) of the <em>Canadian Charter</em> and of s. 3
    of the <em>Quebec Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deschamps J. drew support for this conclusion from the judgment of
    McLachlin C.J.C. in <em>Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36</em>, 2002
    SCC 86, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 710, where the Supreme Court of Canada considered a
    challenge to a school board’s decision to refuse to approve books suggested by
    a teacher depicting same-sex parented families for use at the
    kindergarten-grade one level. The Supreme Court held that, given the Board’s
    statutory mandate of secularism and tolerance, its decision was unreasonable.
    The Board had failed to proceed on the basis of respect for all types of
    families and had instead proceeded on an exclusionary philosophy, responding to
    the concerns of certain parents regarding the morality of same sex
    relationships. This approach failed to consider the right of children of same-sex
    parented families to be accorded equal recognition and respect in the public
    school system. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As McLachlin C.J.C. pointed out, at paras. 64-67, the “cognitive
    dissonance” that a child might experience from learning about things that do
    not correspond to the views of the child’s own parents is part and parcel of
    growing up in a diverse society committed to the acceptance of the fact of
    differences in lifestyles and moral and religious views. “[S]uch dissonance”,
    wrote McLachlin C.J.C., “is neither avoidable nor noxious” but rather something
    children encounter every day as members of a diverse student body in a public
    school system. This kind of cognitive dissonance “is simply a part of living in
    a diverse society” and “a part of growing up” and “arguably necessary if
    children are to be taught what tolerance itself involves.” She went on to
    write: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he demand for tolerance cannot be interpreted as the demand
    to approve of another person’s beliefs or practices. When we ask people to be
    tolerant of others, we do not ask them to abandon their personal convictions. We
    merely ask them to respect the rights, values and ways of being of those who
    may not share those convictions. The belief that others are entitled to equal
    respect depends, not on the belief that their values are right, but on the
    belief that they have a claim to equal respect regardless of whether they are
    right. Learning about tolerance is therefore learning that other people’s
    entitlement to respect from us does not depend on whether their views accord
    with our own. Children cannot learn this unless they are exposed to views that
    differ from those they are taught at home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, while E.T. has made out a sincere religious belief, his subjective
    belief that he must shield his children from hypothetical “false teachings”
    does not gain absolute protection. The onus remains on E.T. to proffer evidence
    that, from an objective standpoint, the instruction and activities to which his
    children are in fact exposed interferes with his ability to do so. E.T. has failed
    to satisfy that onus.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows that, while I agree with the result reached by the
    application judge, I respectfully disagree with his conclusion that E.T. has
    established an infringement of his s. 2(<em>a</em>) right to freedom of
    religion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have found no interference with the appellant’s freedom of religion
    that would engage the protection of s. 2(<em>a</em>), it is unnecessary for me
    to consider whether, under the <em>Doré/Loyola</em> framework, the application
    judge correctly concluded that the Board’s decision refusing E.T.’s request for
    accommodation was reasonable. However, for the sake of completeness, I add that
    even if there were an interference with E.T.’s s. 2(<em>a</em>) protections, I
    agree with the application judge that the Board’s decision to deny him the
    accommodation he requested was reasonable and proportionate in light of its
    statutory mandate to promote equity and inclusive education. The record
    supports the application judge’s finding that the Board <span style='line-height:
200%'>properly considered the appellant’s request and the conflicting interests
    involved. </span>The Board’s decision to deny the requested form of
    accommodation constrained the appellant’s <em>Charter</em>&nbsp;protections no
    more than was necessary given the statutory objectives the Board is required to
    pursue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The protection of religious freedom, like that of other any other <em>Charter</em> right, “must be measured in relation to other rights and with a view to the
    underlying context in which the apparent conflict arises” (<em>Amselem</em>, at
    para. 62; <em>S.L.</em>, at para. 25). The relevant context in this case is
    that E.T.’s children attend a non-denominational public school with a mandate
    to provide an open, accepting and inclusive educational experience for all
    children. E.T. did not ask to have his children exempted from certain specific
    and well-defined elements of the curriculum whose subject matter conflicts with
    his religious views. He declined the Board’s proposal that he withdraw his
    children from the sex education strand of the curriculum. Instead, he seeks to
    have advance notice and the ability to have his children leave the classroom at
    any time a “false teaching” will arise, an exercise that would undermine the
    message of diversity and inclusion which is woven throughout the integrated
    curriculum. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exempting some students on a regular basis from classroom discussions
    touching on diversity, inclusivity and acceptance, within a public school
    program designed to promote precisely those principles, would run a serious
    risk of endorsing the non-acceptance of students of other family backgrounds,
    sexual orientations, gender expressions and gender identities. One of the
    principles at the heart of Ontario’s EIES is ensuring that all students are
    able to “see themselves reflected in their curriculum, their physical
    surroundings, and the broader environment, in which diversity is honoured and
    all individuals are respected”. That principle would be contradicted and
    undermined if, every time certain students’ families and/or identities were
    discussed as being healthy and acceptable, they saw some other members of their
    class leave so that they would not be exposed to such statements of honour and
    respect. I do not accept E.T.’s submission that this proposition should be
    rejected as based upon pure speculation. The Board does not have to wait for
    harm to occur before it is permitted to act on its experience and judgment and
    govern itself accordingly in order to avoid what it perceives, on eminently
    reasonable grounds, to be a very real risk of harm. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the Board’s submission that E.T.’s list of objectionable topics
    set out in the standard PEACE form, which includes items such as “moral
    relativism” and “environmental worship”, is so broad and ill-defined that it
    would be impossible for the Board to determine in advance when a lesson or
    activity might result in exposure to a “false teaching”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The problem of providing advance notice to the appellant in accordance
    with his request is further compounded by the integrated nature of the Board’s
    curriculum. Discussion of topics such as, for example, same-sex parenting does
    not arise in a specific, discrete class or lesson. It is part of the daily lived
    experience of some schoolchildren and, as such, discussion of it might arise at
    any point in any class, in ways that could not be predicted in advance. As the
    application judge found, at para. 96, the list of objectionable subject matter
    identified by E.T. was extensive and “[i]t would be extremely difficult for
    teachers to be sufficiently familiar with the variety of concerns raised by
    parents for individual students so as to advise in advance of their mention in
    lessons.” As pointed out by the intervenor Elementary Teachers’ Federation of
    Ontario, it would be unrealistic to expect teachers to anticipate discussions of
    all such subjects in class and to vet all teaching materials in search of any
    endorsement of family structures, relationships or other matters that are
    contrary to E.T.’s subjective view of biblical teaching, particularly as E.T.’s
    list includes such nebulous topics as “moral relativism”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.T. cannot, by virtue of his religious beliefs, insist that a
    non-denominational public school board restructure its inclusive and integrated
    program, designed to meet its statutory objective of ensuring a respectful and
    accepting climate for all children, so that he can ensure that his own children
    are not exposed to any views that he does not accept. Nor do I accept E.T.’s
    suggestion that the Board could or should ensure that discussion of matters
    such as sexual orientation and gender identity are discussed purely as matters
    of fact rather than as matters of “value judgment”. The Board has a statutory
    mandate to provide an inclusive and tolerant educational environment, one that
    respects the principles of equality enshrined in s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em>.
    Equality, inclusivity and acceptance of difference are values, not facts, and
    it is unrealistic to expect teachers to provide a learning environment that is
    truly welcoming to all students in a value-free manner. </p>

    learning materials that are bias-free and that reflect the diversity of the
    school’s population, including diversity of sexual orientation and gender
    identity. A central feature of the Policy is that diversity,
    anti-discrimination and anti-homophobia are not taught in stand-alone lessons
    but rather are fully integrated into the curriculum so that acceptance of
    difference becomes routine. For example, teaching materials for a lesson in
    mathematics might feature children with two fathers or two mothers. In this
    way, all courses are infused with equity principles and teachers are directed
    to ensure that all students—including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
    transsexual, two spirited, intersex, queer and questioning people—will, in the
    words of the EIES, be “engaged, included, and respected, and … see themselves
    reflected in their learning environment”.</p>

    of the November 18, 2010 meeting with the principals, the appellant was
    especially concerned about issues of human sexuality. This would include the
    use of school books that depicted “two mommies in a book”. The appellant wanted
    his children to be excused from class when such discussions arose. </span></p>

    were resolute in stating that they would not permit the appellant’s children,
    then four years old and six years old, to be excused. They stated that doing so
    would discriminate against classmates who might happen to be living in the
    same-sex circumstances the appellant found to be unacceptable. In the course of
    the meeting, an interesting exchange occurred:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The appellant: If my son sees a
    picture of two mommies in a book and he says “Excuse me, I don’t think God
    wants two women to be married.” Will my son be disciplined for that? </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[School Board's Equity
    Principal]: No, absolutely not. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[Elementary School Principal]:
    No, but I think the teacher would probably say something like “You know [son’s
    name], that’s something you want to go home and speak to you…talk to your
    parents about.” And completely taken out of the classroom… it’s a parent issue
    to discuss that…” </p>

    dated February 3, 2011 from the Superintendent of Student Achievement, who
    refused his accommodation request. The letter explained that students were all
    expected to participate, “in learning activities that reflect the diversity of
    our community.” The reason given for refusing the accommodation was that
    allowing his children to be absent from activities where “various dimensions of
    diversity are addressed” would have a “negative impact […] on other students and
    the learning environment, as it fosters a climate of exclusion.”</span></p>

    factum fairly summarized the appellant’s cross-examination evidence:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The Appellant conceded on
    cross-examination that he is not opposed to the teaching of the topics listed
    on the Form as facts; rather, the Appellant is concerned with a teacher stating
    that something is “ok” or “alright”. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In addition, the Appellant
    clarified in his cross-examination that he does <u>not</u> seek advance
    notification of his children’s participation, or removal of his children from
    class, even if what is discussed conflicts with his religious, moral and
    beliefs if: </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>(i)It arises
    from student generated discussions; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>(ii)The
    teacher participates because of student generated discussions; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>(iii)The
    teacher provides factual information and not value judgments; </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>(iv)The
    discussion is limited to facts related to the proscribed topics identified on
    the Form he submitted as long as the discussion does not involve value

    appears that the appellant agrees to his children being told about the fact of
    same-sex families or to his children being told that they must accept the
    equality of children in same-sex households. He agrees this is necessary in a
    society where all need to get along. While the appellant accepts the equal
    dignity of each person, he does not want his children to be inculcated in the
    view that acceptance of other persons requires full endorsement of all of their
    choices, such as same-sex marriage, which the appellant does not endorse.</span></p>

    that the appellant fears that his children will be persuaded to abandon the
    insights of their religion if the moral positions taken in the policy materials
    receive the active endorsement of their teachers, which the appellant
    characterized as a “value judgment” on the sensitive topic. </span></p>

    The mores contained in the s.169.1 program can conflict with parental religious

    a parent’s freedom of religion for children to be exposed to ideas that
    contradict those of the parents. Some kinds of “cognitive dissonance” can be
    acceptable, as McLachlin C.J. explained in <i>Chamberlain</i> at paras. 64-67.
    See also LeBel J at paras. 211-12 and Gonthier J. in dissent but not on this
    point, at para. 184, <i>S.L.</i>, Deschamps J. at para. 40, LeBel J. at para.
    54, and see generally, <i>Loyola</i>. However, acceptability depends on the
    purpose and effect of the challenged educational program, and also the age of
    the children involved. </span></p>

    educational program is to undermine the religious beliefs of school children,
    then the program, and any decisions made to instantiate it, would limit the
    freedom of religion of the parents unacceptably and beyond the capacity to
    justify under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>: <i>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd</i>.,
    [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295 at para. 88. Sometimes, as the Supreme Court found in <i>Loyola</i>,
    the infringing purpose is easily found on the face of the policy. That is not
    this case. The appellant has put forward no expert evidence that the s.169.1
    program set by the Ministry of Education and implemented by the school board
    has such a purpose. </span></p>

    freedom rights of parents and engage their s. 2(a) <i>Charter</i> right to
    freedom of religion, subject to justification under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    The parents bear the burden proving this limiting effect objectively on the
    balance of probabilities: <i>S.L.</i> at paras. 2, 23-24. The burden of
    justifying the limit is on the state actor.</span></p>

    not put forward any objective evidence that the school board’s decision to
    refuse accommodation is functioning to undermine his ability to transmit the
    precepts of his religion, including teachings about human sexuality, to his
    children. There is no evidence that his children have experienced negative
    teacher “value judgments” of the sort he fears, over the many years this case
    has been pending. Nor has he put forward expert evidence detailing the way in
    which the s.169.1 program actually operates that would have this negative
    effect on his ability to transmit his religious faith to his children in the
    absence of the accommodation he seeks. The lack of such evidence is fatal to
    the appellant’s appeal, which must be dismissed on that basis.</span></p>

    repeat the words of La Forest J. in <i>Jones</i>, at para.&nbsp;63: “Those who

    hard to imagine that a tweak to the program would pose a problem, or to imagine
    a teacher actively using both the force of personality and approved curriculum

    decision under appeal raises some methodological problems. The <i>Doré/Loyola</i> framework cannot easily be applied to a line decision made by several educators

    as an example. In Ontario, school boards are corporations and have a board of
    trustees (sometimes confusingly referred to as the school board), composed of
    democratically elected citizens. Boards of trustees are occasionally required
    to exercise statutory powers in a natural justice hearing under the aegis of
    the <i>Statutory Powers Procedures Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;S.22. However,
    most school board decisions are made by its employees, such as teachers,
    principals, and supervisory officers, as in this case. Sometimes they proceed
    in a manner consistent with policy direction from the <i>Education Act</i>, the
    Ministry of Education, or the board of trustees, and sometimes they are left to
    respond to the exigencies of the circumstances without much policy guidance
    apart from common sense, and their training and experience. These individuals
    typically lack <i>Charter</i> expertise.</span></p>

    eminently reasonable to invoke “reasonableness” as the applicable standard of
    review of discretionary decisions, as the application judge and my colleague
    do. </span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:200%'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>But some questions emerge. I
    reflect on several difficulties with the application of the <i>Doré/Loyola</i> approach to a line decision maker. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, in the necessary
    constitutional analysis, who has decided that the underpinning statutory
    objectives are pressing and substantial? Is the line decision maker competent
    and qualified to make that constitutional assessment? As I see it, applying the <i>Doré/Loyola</i> approach to a line decision maker effectively imports a
    presumption that the statutory objective on which the decision rests is always
    “pressing and substantial”. But this is a contestable proposition. Not every
    legislative or policy objective implemented by a challenged line decision would
    have this character. But a presumption would effectively reverse the s. 1 <i>Charter</i> onus to the rights claimant’s disadvantage.</span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:200%'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, does such a presumption
    put the rights claimant in the position of having to challenge the legislative
    objective in order to defeat the presumption, when all she wants to do is
    challenge a specific decision? </span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:200%'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Third, who is called upon to
    exercise the “justificatory muscles” to which Abella J. refers in paragraph 5
    of<i> Doré</i>, when there is no adjudication at the moment of the challenged
    decision?</span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:200%'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Fourth, what sort of justification
    must the line decision maker offer for the challenged decision? Is it to be
    provided at the moment of decision, or is it in the hands of creative lawyers
    when the decision is challenged judicially? In my view, in order to justify a <i>Charter</i> limit, the record of evidence considered by the line decision maker should
    demonstrate the elements of accountability, intelligibility, adequacy and
    transparency courts expect from administrative tribunals. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Finally, what is the applicable
    standard of review? Is it to be “reasonableness” as the “deferential standard,”
    derived from <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick,</i> 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 1 at
    para.&nbsp;47? This is implied in <i>Doré</i> at para. 47, but that was in
    relation to a regulator functioning in an adjudicative setting, not to a line
    decision maker. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Can these decision makers be
    considered expert in the manner generally understood by administrative law to
    justify a deferential standard of review? Within a narrow professional compass,
    individual school board employees can have a measure of expertise in the
    education profession, acquired by qualifications and training, and by
    experience, but these vary among individuals. When they are confronted with the
    claim that their decision is not sufficiently respectful of <i>Charter</i> rights, will they understand how to reason from constitutional principles? </span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:200%'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Further, can we be sure that these
    line decision makers will inevitably be impartial and fair, even when their own
    decisions are challenged? Can we be sure that their supervisors, also being
    human, will be impartial and fair, and not defensive of the conduct of their
    subordinates? The administration of justice has developed numerous mechanisms
    to ensure impartiality and fairness on the part of decision makers, but none of
    them apply to discretionary line decision makers.</span></p>

    decision of a line official on the basis that it violates a <i>Charter</i> right, there is every prospect that the first impartial decision maker in the
    sequence will be a court or other adjudicative tribunal. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I would be reluctant to apply a
    robust concept of “reasonableness” burdened by a standing obligation of
    judicial deference to a line decision maker’s discretionary decision. There is
    a real risk that a claimant’s <i>Charter</i> rights will not be understood and
    will not be given effect by the line decision maker. I would prefer a more
    sensitive application of the nostrum that “reasonableness takes its colour from
    the context,” and &quot;must be assessed in the context of the particular type
    of decision-making involved and all relevant factors,&quot; as Stratas J.A.
    observed in <i>Re: Sound v. Canadian Association of Broadcasters</i> 2017 FCA
    138 at para. 34, 148 C.P.R. (4th) 91, citing several Supreme Court decisions.
    It is one thing to defer to an educator on educational matters, but something
    else to defer to an educator on constitutional matters. </span></p>
