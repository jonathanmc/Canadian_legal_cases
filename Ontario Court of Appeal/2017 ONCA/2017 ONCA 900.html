  <p class=Heard>Heard: August 29, 2017</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice Andrew J. Goodman of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 25, 2014, and from the convictions
    entered by Justice A. Duncan Grace of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    without a jury, on December 11, 2015.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Trotter J.A.</strong><strong><span style='font-weight:
normal'>:</span></strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jitender Sahdev, the appellant, was trained as a surgeon in India. Because
    he was not qualified as a doctor in Canada, he opened a massage and yoga studio
    with his wife. He was charged with sexually assaulting two female massage
    clients. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown wanted the charges tried together. The appellant wanted separate
    trials. Well before his trial date, the appellant applied for severance. The
    application judge, who was then assigned to be the trial judge, dismissed the application.
    He promised to deliver written reasons at a later date, but never did so. As it
    turned out, a different judge conducted the trial. The trial judge found the
    appellant guilty on both counts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges his convictions on several grounds. I am not
    persuaded that the trial judge committed any errors. However, in my view, the appeal
    must be allowed and a new trial ordered because the application judge’s failure
    to provide reasons for refusing severance frustrates meaningful appellate
    review.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the severance application</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offences for which the appellant was convicted occurred on June 11
    and 12, 2012. The appellant was originally charged in separate Informations. An
    Information containing both counts was subsequently sworn. Following committal
    to stand trial, an indictment was preferred that contained both counts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant originally elected to be tried by judge and jury. On
    February 21, 2014, more than a year and half before trial, he re-elected to be
    tried by a judge sitting alone. On the same day, he applied for severance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In materials filed before the application judge, defence counsel (not
    Mr. Halfyard or Ms. Vandebeek) contended that there was a “likelihood” that the
    appellant would testify in relation to one of the complainants (N.P.), but a
    “substantially lesser likelihood” that he would testify in relation to the
    other (A.W.). The trial Crown (not Ms. Farrell) argued that the appellant’s
    proposal to testify in relation to just one count was not realistic. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until this point in the proceedings, the Crown had considered bringing a
    cross-count, similar fact evidence application. During the severance
    application, the Crown advised that it might also call three other women as
    similar fact witnesses. Overall, the Crown was non-committal on the similar
    fact issue, and said it would make a firm decision at trial. Defence counsel
    conceded that, if the application judge determined that it was likely that the similar
    fact application should succeed, then “the application for severance would
    fall.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge adjourned the case to February 25, 2014, “for my
    oral decision on the severance application.” On that date, he said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As I mentioned, written reasons to follow during the course of
    the judgment in this case. Having reviewed the material, the submissions of
    counsel, and for written reasons to follow, the application for severance is
    dismissed.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>As previously noted, the application judge did not
    conduct the trial, nor did he release reasons on the severance application.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the proceedings at trial</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial commenced 20 months later before a different judge. Although
    reasons for refusing the severance application were still outstanding, defence
    counsel did not renew the application before the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    complainants testified, as did the appellant and his wife, along with a couple
    of other massage and yoga clients. The three additional similar fact witnesses
    mentioned by the Crown on the severance application did not testify. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    events took place at the premises of Savy International (“Savy”), the massage
    and yoga studio operated by the appellant and his wife in London, Ontario. The
    two complainants, A.W. and N.P., came to the studio in similar circumstances – both
    purchased discounted massage coupons on a website called “Dealfind”. A.W.
    received her massage on June 11, 2012; N.P. had hers on June 12, 2012.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Evidence Concerning N.P.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>N.P.
    was 25 years old at the time. During her massage, N.P. was naked, but under a
    draping sheet. She testified that, as the appellant massaged her thighs, his
    fingers lightly grazed her vagina. He also massaged her breasts and briefly put
    his thumbs on her nipples. The appellant then massaged her outer labia with
    both hands. N.P. complained that she was in pain because she had a clitoral
    abscess. The appellant told her she did not. He massaged her clitoris. N.P.
    verbalized her discomfort, but he applied pressure in the area for five to six
    minutes. He stopped because she continued to complain of pain. The appellant
    then kissed N.P. on the mouth three times until she turned her head away. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>N.P.
    testified that, after the massage was finished, she calmed herself and quickly
    left the premises. She got into her car, screamed loudly, and then called her
    boyfriend. Her boyfriend called the police, and N.P. spoke to them that same
    night.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified and denied touching N.P.’s breasts or vagina. As the
    massage progressed, N.P. told him that she experienced pain in her breast and
    from a clitoral abscess. The appellant said he was “offended” because N.P. had
    failed to note these issues on the intake form she completed upon her arrival
    at Savy. According to the appellant, having learned of his medical training
    from his website, N.P. asked him to examine her breast. The appellant declined
    and told her to consult a doctor. Later in the massage, and again because of
    the appellant’s training as a surgeon, N.P. asked him to examine the abscess on
    her clitoris. He refused, advising her that he did not have the necessary tools
    and was not qualified in Canada. The appellant encouraged N.P. to sign up for a
    trip that he was organizing to a yoga retreat in India. If she came along, the
    appellant said he would introduce her to doctors who could examine her clitoral
    abscess. N.P. denied asking the appellant to examine her breast or her
    clitoris. She said there was no discussion of yoga or treatment in India.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence called the appellant’s wife and another Savy client to suggest that
    nothing untoward happened during N.P.’s massage. Both witnesses saw N.P. leave
    the premises after the massage. She appeared to be fine. Ms. Sahdev said that N.P.
    smiled and said the massage was “lovely”. The client said that N.P. looked like
    a “normal person” and did not look angry or upset. The client did not hear any
    unusual sounds (i.e., screaming) coming from the parking lot.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted most of N.P.’s evidence, although he did not accept that
    the appellant massaged her vaginal area for as long as she claimed. The trial
    judge rejected the appellant’s evidence on this count. He variously described
    it in the following ways: “defies belief”; “makes no sense”; “not believable”;
    “nothing short of incredible and wholly unbelievable”; “unfathomable”; and “a
    figment of Mr. Sahdev’s imagination”.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Evidence Concerning A.W.</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.W.,
    who was 27 years old, came to Savy on June 11, 2012. She completed the intake
    form and indicated that she suffered from multiple sclerosis and had tension
    and soreness in her back and neck. She anticipated receiving a relaxing back,
    shoulder, and neck massage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.W.
    went into the massage room and removed her upper clothing and climbed under the
    sheet. When the appellant entered, he noticed that she was wearing pants and
    instructed her to remove them. He left the room while she did so. A.W. thought
    this request was “a little strange”, but she complied. She consented to a full
    body massage. When the appellant returned, A.W. was covered with a draping
    sheet. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    massage commenced with A.W. on her stomach. The draping sheet either fell or
    was pulled off of her at some point during the session. As the appellant was
    massaging her left side, he massaged A.W.’s buttocks for 10 to 15 seconds and
    spread her buttocks apart with his thumbs. A.W. clenched, indicating her discomfort.
    The appellant told her to relax and to let him do his job. While massaging her
    right side, the appellant did not massage her buttocks again. However, his
    fingers ventured into her inner thigh, near her vagina. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    A.W. was on her back, the appellant briefly massaged her breasts, without
    touching her nipples. He then worked his way down her body and applied pressure
    to the top of her pubic area, but did not touch her vagina. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the massage was over, A.W. dressed and left the premises quickly. She told the
    appellant that she would book her next appointment online. She had no intention
    of doing so. A.W. did not complain for a few days, and only after seeing a
    press release following N.P.’s complaint. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that, when A.W. arrived, he told her that he could not
    honour her coupon because it was issued in the name of her boyfriend. She was
    told that she would have to pay for her session but could use the coupon at
    another time. A.W. agreed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant took A.W. to the massage room and told her she could keep on all of
    her clothing. He said he reminded her of this again. The appellant helped her
    onto the table. He put a draping sheet over her, even though she was fully
    clothed. He said he did this as a matter of “courtesy”. The appellant testified
    that the massage proceeded normally and that he did not touch her breasts,
    buttocks, or her vaginal area. The appellant testified that A.W. said that the
    massage was the best she had ever received. However, when it was over, she said
    she could not pay at that time and promised to return the next day to pay. She
    never did.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s wife said that, as she was readying the room for A.W.’s massage,
    she heard her husband tell A.W. that she could remain fully clothed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 28, 2012, “Dealfind” advised the appellant that a refund had been
    requested for the voucher presented by A.W. On July 4, 2012, the appellant was
    arrested for sexually assaulting A.W.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge identified shortcomings in A.W.’s evidence that “troubled” him. He
    attributed them to her failure to review her videotaped police interview.
    Nevertheless, he accepted A.W.’s evidence in general.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence. He found that the appellant’s
    seemingly encyclopaedic memory of A.W’s massage session was contrived. He
    rejected Ms. Sahdev’s evidence about hearing her husband tell A.W. that she could
    remain fully clothed as “particularly improbable”. He rejected the appellant’s
    evidence about draping a fully clothed client as incredible. The trial judge
    said: “Bluntly, I do not believe either Mr. or Ms. Sahdev.”</p>

lang=EN-GB>I would decline to decide the case on this basis. It would involve
    deciding the severance issue afresh, without any foundation other than the bare
    conclusion of the application judge. This is a fundamentally different exercise
    than attempting to evince reasons from the record. We are essentially being
    asked to reverse-engineer the application judge’s bottom line conclusion to
    deny severance. This is not the role cast for an appellate court when reasons
    have not been provided. This limit is recognized in </span><em>R. v. Dinardo</em><span
lang=EN-GB>, 2008 SCC 24, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 788, in which Charron J. wrote the
    following, at para. 32:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>This exercise is not an invitation to
    appellate courts to engage in a reassessment of aspects of the case not

    not to substitute its own analysis for that of the trial judge (</span><em>Sheppard</em><span

    court said in </span><em>Frost</em><span lang=EN-GB>, at para. 2: “It is not
    for this court to make findings of fact that are necessary for the
    determination of the presenting legal issues.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acceding
    to the Crown’s request would involve overshooting the limits of <em>Dinardo</em> in not just one, but two respects. This is because, embedded in the severance
    decision, is a similar fact evidence application. Because the application judge
    failed to deliver written reasons, this court does not have the benefit of his
    appraisal of the potential merits of this application. In fairness to the
    application judge, the Crown was non-committal on this issue. In the
    circumstances, the application judge may have given this factor minimal weight.
    But without reasons, we are left to guess. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue is further complicated by what happened at trial. For perfectly
    legitimate reasons, the trial judge determined that he did not need to consider
    the similar fact application. He evaluated the evidence on each count
    separately.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This combination of circumstances, involving a decision without
    reasons on one issue (severance), coupled with no decision on the other
    (similar fact evidence), presents serious challenges for appellate review. Both
    are discretionary decisions attracting deference on appeal. In the case of
    severance decisions, see <em>R. v. Litchfield</em>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333, at p. 354;
    and <em>Savoury</em>, at para. 26. For similar fact rulings, see <em>R. v. B.

    all of the circumstances, I have concluded that this is not an appropriate case
    for this court to decide these two issues afresh. Regrettably, these issues
    must be resolved at a new trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    appreciate the repercussions of deciding the case on this basis. The
    appellant’s trial was a model of fairness. As I explain below, the trial judge
    made no errors in conducting the trial. However, severance is not a minor or
    technical matter; it is a critical procedural decision, governed by the
    “interests of justice”: <em>Litchfield</em>, pp. 349-350.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was entitled to know why it was not in “the interests of justice”
    (see s. 591(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>) to conduct two short trials
    instead of one slightly longer trial. In order to meaningfully review the
    application judge’s decision not to order severance, this court requires
    considered reasons for making this discretionary decision, reasons that would
    have included at least some preliminary assessment of the similar fact evidence
    issue. Without reasons on either issue, this court is required to start from
    scratch, contrary to the proscription in <em>Dinardo.</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown relies on the decision of this court in <em>Aalami</em>, in which the
    trial judge failed to provide reasons for dismissing an application under s.
    11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. This court determined that there was no need for
    a new trial because it was “able to explain the result to the parties”: at
    para. 18, citing <em>Sheppard</em>, at para. 55. The court applied the
    presumptive guidelines established in <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27,
    [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631 and dismissed the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for severance is not so straightforward or self-applying. It is highly
    discretionary and requires a balancing of numerous factors. In <em>Last</em>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada articulated the factors to be considered. As
    Deschamps J. wrote, at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The factors identified by the courts are not
    exhaustive. They simply help capture how the interests of justice may be served

    desire to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings. Moreover, and while not
    mentioned in </span><em>Last</em><span lang=EN-GB>, the fact that the appellant
    ultimately elected trial by judge alone may have gone some way to ameliorating
    any prejudice involved in a joint trial.</span></p>

    evidence and the appellant’s stated desire to testify only in relation to the

    properly decide the severance issue. </span></p>

    defence, while the burden to admit similar fact evidence is on the Crown. The
    exercise must be approached with great care: see </span><em>Last</em><span

    This shift in position was not necessarily fatal to the correctness of the
    decision to refuse severance. However,</span><em><span lang=EN-GB> </span></em><span

    circumstances, the appellant would not benefit from separate trials; he would
    be required to confront the testimony of both complainants in either scenario. Without
    an indication as to the viability of the similar fact application, it is
    difficult to evaluate the reasonableness of the appellant’s stated intention to
    testify in relation to just one of the counts.</span></p>

    used in </span><em>Last</em><span lang=EN-GB>, which the trial judge in that
    case found to be too vague to be taken seriously, at para. 22. However, an
    accused person is not required to commit to a course of action in advancing a
    defence. As Deschamps J. stated, at para. 26:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>However, while a formulaic expression of a

    and determine that the accused should testify or not. Rather, the trial judge
    must simply satisfy him- or herself that the circumstances objectively
    establish a rationale for testifying on some counts but not others</span><span
lang=EN-GB>. The burden on the accused is to provide the trial judge with
    sufficient information to convey that, objectively, there is substance to his

    different tactical approach. To succeed on the N.P. count, especially given
    that she testified the appellant kissed her, the appellant may have been
    required to testify in order to effectively challenge N.P.’s version. With

    including the viability of the similar fact application. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Crown argues that, if s. 686(1)(b)(iii) is
    not applied to the A.W. count (on which the appellant said he was reluctant to
    testify), it should be applied to the N.P. count (on which the appellant said
    there was a likelihood that he would testify). I would decline to apply the
    proviso in this manner. To do so would suggest that the trial was only half
    fair. Preserving the conviction on one count, but not the other, is an
    inadequate half measure that fails to properly vindicate the duty to give
    reasons for a fundamental decision, which is at the heart of this appeal. </span></p>

    a new trial. However, for the sake of completeness, I briefly consider the
    appellant’s other grounds of appeal.  </span></p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Uneven Scrutiny</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not approach the evidence unfairly by applying differential
    standards of scrutiny to the Crown and defence evidence. He carefully reviewed
    the evidence of each witness for honesty, plausibility, as well as internal and
    external consistency. This was undertaken through the lens of the presumption
    of innocence and the proper burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has considered the complaint of uneven scrutiny on many occasions. The
    argument usually fails. In <em>R. v. Aird</em>, 2013 ONCA 447, 307 O.A.C. 183,
    Laskin J.A. explains why. At para. 39, he said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The &quot;different standards of
    scrutiny&quot; argument is a difficult argument to succeed on in an appellate
    court. It is difficult for two related reasons: credibility findings are the
    province of the trial judge and attract a very high degree of deference on
    appeal; and appellate courts invariably view this argument with skepticism,
    seeing it as a veiled invitation to reassess the trial judge's credibility
    determinations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Gravesande</em>, 2015 ONCA 774, 128 O.R. (3d) 111, Pardu J.A.
    elaborated on what is required to succeed, at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>For an appellant to successfully advance this
    ground of appeal, she must identify something clear in the trial judge's
    reasons or the record indicating that a different standard of scrutiny was
    applied and something sufficiently significant to displace the deference due to
    a trial judge's credibility assessments. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has been unable to identify anything in the trial judge’s reasons
    that would substantiate his claim. The passages he points to are minor and
    unimportant, holding the trial judge’s reasons to an impossible standard.
    Moreover, the trial judge was aware of this body of law. He said the following
    in his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In assessing the evidence of witnesses, the same level of
    scrutiny must be applied to all of the evidence provided at trial, whether
    given or introduced by a complainant, the defendant or some other witness. I
    believe I have done so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s detailed reasons confirm that he observed the standard he
    correctly identified. There is no merit to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediate Reporting to the Police</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    what appears to be a reverse recent complaint argument, the appellant argues
    that the trial judge erred in relying on the fact that N.P. reported the
    incident to the police almost immediately. The trial judge referred to this
    evidence when recounting defence evidence concerning N.P.’s seemingly normal
    demeanour when she left the premises. N.P. said that she went into her car,
    screamed, and then called her boyfriend, who told her to go talk to the police
    immediately. She did. As the trial judge said in his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[N.P.] complained to the police within hours, if not minutes.
    Mr. Sahdev was arrested about six hours later. The fact [N.P.] made an almost
    immediate complaint to the police is not proof of Mr. Sahdev’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge did not err in dealing with this evidence. At
    trial, the appellant’s counsel argued that N.P.’s credibility was in doubt
    because she failed to complain earlier, inside the Savy premises. The defence
    also suggested collusion on the part of the complainants. In these
    circumstances, the trial judge did not err in using this evidence in the way
    that he did: see <em>R. v. D.B.</em>, 2013 ONCA 578, <span lang=EN-GB>310
    O.A.C. 294, at paras. 30-38. He cautioned himself appropriately.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
