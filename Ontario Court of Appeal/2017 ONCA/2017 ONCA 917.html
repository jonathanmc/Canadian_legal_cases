  <p class=Judge>Epstein J.A.:</p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal addresses financial issues arising from marital breakdown.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 12, 2010, the appellant Tammy Emmerson entered into a
    separation agreement with her then-husband, the respondent Troy Emmerson.  Five
    years later, the appellant commenced an action to set aside the separation
    agreement, on the basis of the respondent’s material non-disclosure.  She also
    sought orders awarding her spousal support, increased child support, and
    equalization of the respondent’s undisclosed assets. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The trial judge set aside the separation agreement through an order
    dated March 31, 2016.  Upon setting aside the agreement, the trial judge made a
    number of orders pertaining to division of assets and child and spousal
    support.  The respondent’s book of business (the “Book”) was valued at $120,000
    and determined to be his only asset for equalization purposes.  The trial judge
    also increased the amount of the respondent’s monthly child support
    obligations, finding his income to be greater than the amount he had claimed in
    his evidence at trial.  The appellant’s claim for spousal support was denied.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, the appellant challenges three aspects of the trial
    judge’s decision: 1) the valuation of the Book; 2) the finding that she is not
    entitled to spousal support; and 3) the quantification of the respondent’s
    income for the purposes of child support (and spousal support, should her
    argument on that front succeed). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of her second and third grounds of appeal, the appellant has
    brought a motion asking this court to admit fresh evidence.  The proposed
    evidence falls into two categories – an update of the respondent’s commission
    earnings for 2014 and 2015, and photographs that the appellant says demonstrate
    the disparity in the parties’ lifestyles, post-separation.  For reasons
    provided below, I would admit only the fresh evidence of the respondent’s updated
    income.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the main grounds of appeal, I have concluded that the trial judge
    erred in his assessment of the respondent’s income for child support purposes,
    and in dismissing the appellant’s claim for spousal support.  I would increase
    the amount of child support arrears, adjust ongoing child support and award
    ongoing spousal support for a period of ten years from the date of separation. 
    In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A brief summary of the facts is set out here.  I provide additional
    facts where necessary when discussing the decision below and the parties'
    submissions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties began cohabiting on February 1, 1992, and were married on
    October 1, 1999.  They have one child, Nathan, born March 5, 2001.  The parties
    separated on September 1, 2009, but, for a time, continued to reside together
    in the former matrimonial home.  The parties entered into a separation
    agreement on January 12, 2010. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When negotiations over the agreement began in September 2009, the
    respondent was employed by Money Concepts as a financial planner.  By early
    November 2009, he decided to leave Money Concepts<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and move to Investment Planning Council (“IPC”).  About a year later, the
    respondent moved from IPC to World Source Financial Management
    (&quot;WSFM&quot;).  He worked in financial planning at these various
    companies, and was paid commissions through numbered companies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    January 12, 2010, when the separation agreement was signed, the respondent had
    moved out of the matrimonial home.  The appellant remained in the home pending
    the completion of its sale in March, 2010.  She then stayed in rental
    accommodations until the respondent purchased, in his own name, a residence at
    172 Churchland Drive for her and Nathan to live in.  The respondent advanced
    the $30,000 down payment for the property and made most of the mortgage
    payments.  When he sold this home, the respondent received net proceeds of sale
    in excess of $83,000.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nathan
    primarily resided with his mother following separation, except for a 13 month
    period between March, 2013 and April, 2014 when the parties shared joint
    custody.  In May 2012, the respondent was ordered to start making monthly child
    support payments of $546 based on presumed annual income of $60,000.  The
    respondent was also ordered to pay retroactive child support for the months of
    March and April, 2012. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 26, 2011, the appellant initiated these proceedings in which she applied to
    have the separation agreement set aside pursuant to s. 56(4) of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (the “<em>FLA</em>&quot;).  The appellant
    claimed that the respondent had failed to disclose the existence of a
    significant asset – the Book – and sought an equalization payment based on her
    valuation of this asset.  The appellant also alleged that the respondent had
    materially misrepresented his income.  She sought retroactive and ongoing child
    and spousal support, based on adjusted income figures. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent sought an order upholding the validity of the separation agreement.  He
    argued that he did not own the Book at the time he signed the separation
    agreement and that he had not misrepresented his income.  He opposed the
    appellant’s request for spousal support and increased child support. </p>
  <h1>DECISION BELOW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span style='line-height:200%'>The
    following is a summary only of the relevant portions of the trial judge’s
    reasons for setting aside the separation agreement.  I discuss the balance of
    the trial judge’s reasons within my analysis of each ground of appeal raised
    before this court. </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the question of whether the separation agreement should be set aside, the trial
    judge applied the two-part test from <em>Levan v. Levan</em>, 2008 ONCA 388, 90
    O.R. (3d) 1.  In the circumstances of this case, the trial judge had to
    determine whether there was non-disclosure of a significant asset, and if so, whether
    it was appropriate to set aside the domestic contract. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge first considered whether there had been non-disclosure of a
    significant asset.  It was not disputed that the separation agreement was negotiated
    on the assumption that the respondent did not own the Book.  At trial, the
    appellant submitted the respondent did, in fact, own the Book at the relevant
    time and had failed to disclose that fact. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge agreed.  He based this conclusion on the respondent’s having
    received a $120,000 transition allowance when he moved from Money Concepts to
    IPC.  The trial judge reasoned that IPC would not have been willing to pay a
    transition allowance if the respondent was not planning to bring clients with
    him.  The respondent had not disclosed this transition allowance while
    negotiating the separation agreement.  In fact, he took steps to hide it by
    directing mail to his parents' address and having IPC deposit the initial
    installment of the allowance into his parents' bank account. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on a review of the parties’ financial information and the respondent’s conduct
    during negotiations, the trial judge concluded that the nondisclosure of the
    Book constituted nondisclosure of a significant asset, sufficiently serious to
    justify setting aside the separation agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made further orders relating to equalization payments and child and
    spousal support obligations.  As each of those orders is the subject of a
    discrete ground of appeal, I will discuss the balance of the trial judge’s
    reasons within my analysis of the submissions advanced by the parties before
    this court. </p>

    orders and the importance of finality in family law litigation.  An appeal
    court should only intervene where there is a material error, a serious
    misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law.  It is not entitled to
    overturn a support order simply because it would have made a different decision
    or balanced the factors differently:  </span><em>Hickey v. Hickey</em><span

  <h3><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in valuing the Book?</h3>
  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> The trial judge’s
    reasons</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge determined the equalization payments owed to the appellant based solely
    on his appraisal of the Book’s value.  He found that the respondent had no
    other assets affecting his net family property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The appellant called an expert who had been retained to value
    the Book.  The expert testified that he had not obtained sufficient disclosure
    from the respondent to value the Book.  The appellant therefore sought to
    tender material from the internet to provide the court with a method for
    assessing the Book’s value. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s independent internet research indicated three methods for valuing a
    financial practice.  She advocated for the “recurring revenue” approach.  Under
    this approach, the Book’s value would be equal to the gross commissions paid to
    the respondent from the businesses in the Book, multiplied by a factor of 2-3.5.
     This approach was also employed in a share purchase agreement that assessed
    the value of a buyout of the respondent’s shares in a numbered company.  The
    share purchase agreement referred to that methodology as “standard industry
    practice”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not accept appellant’s proposed method.  Instead, he held that
    the $120,000 transition allowance from IPC was the best evidence of the value
    of the Book at the date of separation.  While acknowledging that it would have
    been open to him to accept an alternate approach to valuing the Book, the trial
    judge was persuaded that IPC’s willingness to pay $120,000 for the respondent
    to transfer his assets under management to them provided probative,
    contemporaneous evidence of the Book’s value.  Given that the respondent did
    not declare the transition allowance as income on his tax returns, the trial
    judge valued the Book at $120,000 at the time of separation, without any
    deduction for income taxes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Book was the only asset that affected the respondent’s net family property,
    the trial judge ordered the respondent to make an equalization payment of
    $60,000 with pre-judgment interest from September 1, 2009.</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> The parties’
    submissions </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in determining that the $120,000
    transition allowance was the best evidence of the value of the Book.  She
    argues that the transition allowance has no relation to the Book’s value as the
    respondent received the transition allowance while continuing to own the Book.  Moreover,
    given that the respondent’s lack of disclosure prevented her expert from
    valuing the Book, the appellant submits the trial judge’s approach effectively rewards

lang=EN-US>The appellant contends that the internet research she proffered at
    trial provides an alternate approach to determining the Book’s value.  She </span>asks
    for an order that the Book be valued at between $408,666.66 and $715,166.66
    (being 2 to 3.5 times the average gross dealer commission listed in the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span

    respondent argues that the trial judge was correct to reject the internet

    and only available evidence the of Book’s value, particularly as the payment
    was made contemporaneously with the negotiation of the separation agreement. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span

    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave fair consideration to the appellant’s proposed alternative
    valuation approach.  At paras. 255-256 of his reasons, he acknowledged that a
    share purchase agreement to which the appellant was a party employed the
    “commission earnings” approach outlined in the appellant’s internet research.  Based
    on that evidence, the trial judge acknowledged that “it certainly would have
    been open to this court to find that the value of the [Book] at the date of
    separation was far higher than the $120,000 transition allowance that [the
    respondent] received.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, however, chose to rely on the transition allowance as the fairest
    available assessment of value.  In my view, this was a reasonable choice.  The
    trial judge received no independent evidence as to the reliability of the
    appellant’s internet research or the assumptions on which it was based.  While
    the share purchase agreement provided some corroboration for the appellant’s
    suggested valuation, the trial judge determined it did not provide sufficient<i> </i>support to establish the commission multiplier approach as the best marker
    of value.  This conclusion is entitled to deference.   </p>

  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> The trial judge’s reasons</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    assess the appellant’s claims for increased retroactive and prospective child
    support, the trial judge had to first determine the respondent’s income from
    2009-2014. </p>
  <h5>The Respondent’s Income (2009-2014)</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    negotiating the separation agreement in the fall of 2009, the respondent
    informed the appellant that his income was $48,000.  However, the respondent’s
    income tax returns and notices of assessment/reassessment showed that he had
    represented the following incomes to the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) from
    2006 to 2009: 2006 - $161,548. 53, 2007 - $154,683, 2008 - $90,153, 2009 -
    $86,141.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant’s representation of income to the CRA was
    the best evidence of his 2009 income.  In his view, it defied logic that the
    respondent would have overstated his income to the CRA.  Accordingly, the
    respondent’s statements to the appellant as to his 2009 income amounted to
    material misrepresentations.  When the respondent filed his 2009 income tax return,
    he would have known that his income was far higher than what he represented to
    the appellant in January 2010. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the respondent’s
    representations to the appellant and to the court about his income level from
    2010 to 2014 were similarly unhelpful. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the respondent disclosed
    post-separation income from his notices of assessment/reassessment, as follows:
    2010 - $42,310, 2011 - $46,048, 2012 - $36,568, 2013 - $62,968, and 2014 - $59,695.
     The trial judge found, however, that the respondent’s income tax returns and
    notices of assessment/reassessment for these years did not “in any way”
    disclose his real income.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Instead, the trial judge concluded that the
    commissions paid to the respondent by IPC – and later, WSFM – provided the best
    indication of his post-separation income.  Those commissions were deposited in
    the bank accounts of two numbered companies incorporated by the respondent and
    his partners Michael Kidman and Greg Merkley: 1793803 Ontario Ltd. (“179”) and 1862065
    Ontario Inc. (“186”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent incorporated 179 when he joined
    IPC with Kidman and Merkley. Commissions owing to three parties would be paid
    by IPC into 179’s bank accounts.  The respondent had his own account into which
    his commissions were deposited (the “179 Individual Account”).  There was also
    an operating account out of which joint overhead expenses were paid (the “179
    Joint Account”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    respondent transitioned to WSFM.  He received a further transition allowance.  WSFM
    deposited commissions into the 179 bank accounts in the same manner as IPC. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2012, Kidman and Merkley incorporated 186.  The
    respondent directed WSFM to pay his commissions into his 186 accounts.  After
    incorporating 186, Kidman and Merkley entered into an agreement to purchase the
    respondent’s shares of 179.  The alleged purchase price was $187,000, to be
    paid in equal instalments of $37,400 commencing on May 8, 2012.  At trial, the
    respondent took the position that he was merely an employee of 186, receiving a
    salary of $40,000 a year, plus 25% of the commissions realized on any
    &quot;new&quot; business.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that 186 had been
    incorporated for no reason other than the litigation and that the respondent was
    not merely an employee of the company.  He concluded that the commissions paid
    by WSFM to the respondent that were deposited into his 179 Individual Account
    (or later, his 186 account), were the best evidence of his real income.  Other
    &quot;joint&quot; commissions the respondent earned were deposited by WSFM into
    the 179 Joint Account (and in all likelihood, the trial judge found, into a
    similar type of account with 186).  The trial judge concluded that these “joint”
    deposits were the respondent’s contributions to the joint operating expenses or
    overhead of 179 and 186.  The trial judge therefore excluded these deposits
    from the respondent’s imputed income. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Disclosure obtained by the appellant prior to

    $165,239, 2012 - $163,166, 2013 - $173,274, 2014 (January to August) - $156,315.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge, however made two further

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the trial judge deducted 15% from the
    respondent’s commission earnings from 2010-2014, on the basis that the
    respondent was essentially a commission salesman and entitled to deduct some business
    expenses from his earned commissions.  In round numbers, the respondent was
    found to have the following income in the years 2010 to 2014: 2010 - $145,000, 2011
    -$140,500, 2012 - $138,700, 2013 - $147,000, 2014 - $132,800. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the trial judge calculated the
    respondent’s child support obligations for any given year using an <i>average</i> of 85% of his last three years of imputed income.  In the trial judge’s view, to
    simply base child support obligations on the respondent’s previous year’s
    income would invite the respondent to continue to thwart the appellant’s
    attempts to obtain disclosure and reasonable child support based on that
    disclosure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Relying on this approach, the trial judge turned

  <h5 style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US>The Respondent’s Child
    Support Obligations (2010-2015)</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge determined no child support was owing for 2010 and 2011, as a
    result of financial assistance the respondent provided to the appellant during
    those years.  Following separation, the respondent provided money to the
    appellant on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  As previously indicated, he purchased a
    home for the appellant and Nathan and made mortgage payments on that property. 
    On the basis of these payments, the trial judge concluded that any retroactive
    claim for support should date back only to May 1, 2012.  That date roughly coincided
    with the commencement of the temporary monthly child support order of $546,
    pursuant to the 2009 separation agreement.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the court did not have evidence of the respondent’s total commission income for
    2009, his 2012 income for child support purposes was the average of his 2009
    income of $86,141 (as stated in his tax return) and 85% of commission earned in
    2010 and 2011.  This gave rise to an obligation to pay monthly child support of
    $1,060 for the eight months in which child support was due in 2012 (May to
    December). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    2013, the respondent’s income for child support purposes was 85% of the average
    of his 2010, 2011 and 2012 commissions, resulting in $1200 a month in child
    support.  However, for 10 months during this period, Nathan was sharing time
    between his parents, equally.  Accordingly, the trial judge set-off child
    support payable by the appellant, based on her 2012 income of $56,120. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    2014, the respondent’s income for child support purposes was 85% of the average
    of his 2011, 2012 and 2013 commissions, resulting in $1,203 per month in child
    support.  However, four months of joint custody had to be set-off, based on the
    appellant’s 2013 income of $58,575. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    2015, the respondent’s income for child support purposes was 85% of the average
    of his 2012, 2013 and 2014 commissions, resulting in $1,188 per month in child
    support.  The trial judge’s assessment of the respondent’s 2014 commission
    earnings was based on figures from January to August. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the court did not yet have evidence of 2015 commissions, child support
    obligations for 2016 were ordered to continue based on the 2015 figure, at
    $1,188 per month, until further disclosure was provided in accordance with the
    trial judge’s decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties do not contest the trial judge’s decision to award retroactive child
    support, or his decision to use the respondent’s commission earnings from IPC
    and WSFM as the best evidence of his income for child support purposes from
    2010 to 2014. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, however, raises several other issues about how the trial judge
    calculated the respondent’s income for support purposes from 2010-2015.  Two of
    those objections apply to all six of those years.  I will address those at the
    outset. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant submits the trial judge erred in applying a 15% “business
    expenses” reduction to the respondent’s commission earnings.  The trial judge
    had already excluded from the respondent’s income commissions deposited into
    the 179 and 186 Joint Accounts, on the basis that such funds were used primarily
    for business expenses and overhead costs.  Yet the trial judge further reduced
    the respondent’s income for support purposes by a further 15%, on the basis
    that he was a commission salesperson who &quot;may&quot; have incurred other,
    undisclosed business expenses. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent urges deference to the trial judge’s finding that some expenses
    should be legitimately deducted from the commissions earned. </p>
  <h4>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Analysis</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the appellant’s position.  <span
class=MsoCommentReference><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the trial
    judge erred in deducting business expenses given the lack of evidence from the
    respondent on this point, coupled with the trial judge’s finding that the
    “lion’s share</span></span><span class=MsoCommentReference><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>of </span>the
    [respondent’s]’s business expenses were paid through [179]”.  The burden of
    proof for the deductions rested with the respondent.  The trial judge accounted
    for the respondent’s business expenses by declining to impute income based on
    the commission earnings deposited into the Joint Accounts.  Any further
    deductions, in my view, needed to be supported by evidence.  They were not. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second, broad objection to the trial judge’s income calculations
    relates to his decision to average the respondent’s income for the three
    previous years in relation to the year in which support was owing.  The trial
    judge’s stated purpose for doing so was to protect the appellant from
    non-disclosure.  However, given the steady increase in the respondent's income,
    the appellant submits this averaging in fact reduced the respondent’s support
    obligations and rewarded him for non-disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellant on this issue as
    well.  The trial judge provides no explanation of the averaging approach and
    instead simply states at para. 276 that “it is reasonable to base the
    respondent’s child support obligations on the average of 85% of his last three
    years commission income.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    ordering support, but determining support arrears.  In this context, the trial
    judge’s averaging approach was not logically connected to his stated objective:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits the trial judge erred in determining that no child support
    was owing for 2010.  She points to two errors in his reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant argues the trial judge failed to consider the evidence that, in
    exchange for the respondent’s “financial assistance” in 2010, the appellant
    transferred to him her locked-in RRSP, worth approximately $45,000.  The
    appellant claims this transfer occurred because of the respondent’s misrepresentations,
    as he provided assistance under the guise of &quot;loans&quot; rather than
    paying the equalization and support to which the appellant was entitled.  The
    reality, the appellant claims, is that the respondent paid no child support for
    2010, and also fraudulently obtained a significant income-producing asset. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant submits the trial judge erred by failing to calculate what the
    respondent’s child support obligations should have been for 2010.  Accordingly,
    he was unable to determine if the respondent’s support obligations would have
    exceeded the financial assistance he provided that year.  Relatedly, the trial
    judge failed to consider whether the 2009 transition payment from IPC of
    $120,000 should be added to the respondent’s 2009 income.  Had that transition
    allowance been added, the respondent’s child support obligations may well have
    exceeded any financial assistance he provided.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits the trial judge’s determination of income is entitled to
    deference.  The respondent also contends that the 2009 IPC transition payments
    should not be added to the respondent’s income.  The respondent points out that
    the IPC transition allowance was found to be an asset as of the date of
    separation, and ordered equalized between the parties.  Accordingly, adding
    this sum into his income would be double recovery. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Except
    on the issue of the IPC transition allowance, I am in substantial agreement

    the appellant’s position.  The appellant points to an email from the respondent
    that refers to the RRSP transfer as a “swap”, a CRA form confirming the RRSP
    transfer, evidence of the transfer from the appellant’s 2010 financial
    statements, evidence of the RRSP in the respondent’s accounts, as of December
    31, 2012, valued at $48,999.01, and evidence of the RRSP’s value from the

lang=EN-US>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the appellant submitted she was

    reasons: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>a) during
    the marriage the parties were both gainfully employed outside the house; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>b) during

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>c) even if

    to fund her education, this did not create entitlement to spousal support; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>d) the
    fact that during cohabitation the respondent’s income may have been
    significantly higher than the appellant’s did not create entitlement either.</span></p>

    parties’ submissions</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge, in dismissing her claim for spousal
    support, failed to consider any of the objectives found in s. 15.2(6) of the <em>Divorce
    Act</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.).  Further, the trial judge failed to
    make any findings of fact in relation to the evidence of the &quot;conditions,
    means, needs and other circumstances&quot; of the parties, as required by s.
    15.2(4).  Accordingly, there are no findings upon which deference is due. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant further submits that the failure to pay proper
    equalization and support upon separation is a relevant circumstance for
    consideration in relation to spousal support.  The consequences of that misconduct
    are also relevant.  <span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The appellant
    submits that, in reliance on the respondent’s serial misrepresentations, she put
    her career aspirations on hold with the result that her standard of living post-separation
    has been significantly depressed.  </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also
    claims that the respondent’s failure to disclose his actual income after
    separation prevented her from staying in the matrimonial home, resulting in
    significant financial hardship for several years post-separation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits that the standard of review on all matters relating to
    support is highly deferential.  In determining that the appellant had failed to
    surpass the threshold of entitlement to spousal support, the trial judge
    specifically cited s. 15 of the <em>Divorce Act</em>, as well as this court’s
    seminal decision in <em>Fisher v. Fisher</em>, 2008 ONCA 11, 2008 ONCA 11, 88
    O.R. (3d) 241.  The record fully supported all his findings. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    terms of compensatory support, the respondent submits that Ontario
    jurisprudence clearly demonstrates that all long-term marriages do not give
    rise to such an entitlement.  The purpose of compensatory support is to share
    the economic advantages and disadvantages that accrued on account of the
    marriage and its subsequent breakdown.  The evidence at trial, and recent case
    law, fully supports the trial judge’s finding that the appellant had no
    entitlement to compensatory support (i.e. both parties were employed, and the
    appellant’s marital responsibilities did not adversely affect her employment). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    non-compensatory spousal support, the Supreme Court has been clear that
    marriage <em>per se</em> does not entitle a spouse to support.  Based on the
    evidence, the trial judge concluded that this was the kind of marriage alluded
    to in <em>Moge v. Moge</em>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813, in which no support would be
    called for following the breakdown of the marriage.  He also correctly noted
    that disparity of income does not by itself create an entitlement to spousal
    support. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent
    also notes that the appellant continues to enjoy a standard of living commensurate
    to that which she was accustomed to during the marriage.  The fact that child
    support was awarded retroactively addresses any need the appellant alleges to
    have experienced following the separation.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    trial judge erred in failing to consider in his analysis of spousal support the
    respondent’s misrepresentations concerning his income and the impact they had
    on the appellant during the marriage and after it came to an end. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent’s
    deceit of the appellant in relation to his income was a significant feature
    that adversely affected the appellant’s economic prospects post-separation.  The
    economic disadvantage arising out of this deception shows itself in the
    evidence at trial that demonstrated the economic hardship experienced by the
    appellant and the disparity in the parties’ standard of living after this
    lengthy relationship had come to an end. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    made no findings of fact concerning the respondent’s misrepresentations in
    relation to the parties’ economic interdependence, the marital and post-marital
    standards of living and, most significantly, the financial impact on the
    appellant of the respondent’s chronic misrepresentations as to his income.  In
    the result, contrary to the edict in <em>Moge</em>, at pp. 866-867, the economic
    impact of the marriage and its termination were not equitably shared between
    the parties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During their
    lengthy relationship, the appellant took a full-time salaried position as a
    court reporter, allowing the respondent to focus on building his network of
    contacts.  As his income increased, and as the trial judge’s reasons indicate,
    he deceived and withheld information from the appellant.  The respondent had to
    forgo any educational upgrading, as she believed her continued employment
    income was essential to the family. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    found that the possibility of lost employment opportunities did not, by itself,
    create an entitlement to spousal support.  However, the trial judge was bound
    to consider this evidence in combination with the other impacts of the
    respondent’s misrepresentations to the appellant.  The evidence supports the
    finding that had the respondent not misrepresented his income and assets, and instead,
    as of separation, provided the support and equalization ultimately found owing,
    the appellant would have had the funds to purchase and remain in the
    matrimonial home, or to provide a down payment on another suitable home.  As a
    consequence of the respondent’s behaviour, her financial circumstances have
    been significantly impacted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The economic
    disadvantage to the appellant was further exacerbated by the respondent’s
    conduct when, rather than providing full disclosure post-separation, he
    provided financial assistance in the guise of &quot;loans&quot;, and later sought
    repayment through a transfer of the entire amount of the appellant’s locked-in
    RRSP.  At the time of the &quot;loans&quot; and subsequent RRSP transfer, the
    appellant had no knowledge that equalization and more generous support was
    owing her.  The transaction would not have been necessary if full disclosure had
    been made.  As a result, the appellant’s financial security upon retirement has
    been comprised.  The respondent, by contrast, was in a position to contribute
    $22,000 to his own RRSP less than five months after separation, as well as
    purchase two homes with significant down payments.  During litigation, he sold
    both of these properties for a significant profit. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, an
    award of spousal support would be appropriate in the circumstances. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note, however,
    that in my analysis of spousal support I have not relied on the photographs of
    the parties’ homes tendered by the appellant as proposed fresh evidence of
    disparity in their standards of living.  In my view, the photographs should not
    be admitted.  No evidence has been offered to give the photographs any context
    to support an assessment of their credibility and relevance.  They do not meet
    the requirements for admission of fresh evidence set out in <em>R. v. Palmer</em>,
    [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775; <em>Virc. v. Blair</em>, 2017 ONCA 394, at
