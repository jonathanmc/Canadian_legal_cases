  <p class=Judge><strong>Benotto J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal involves a 10-year-old girl. It is
    the second appeal from the trial decision. Following a 17-day trial, she was
    made a Crown ward with no access for the purpose of adoption. The biological
    parents appealed the no access order. The first appeal judge found no error
    with the trial judge’s determination of access, but nonetheless ordered access followed
    by an openness hearing before him. In a wide-ranging analysis, he said trial
    counsel was incompetent; ordered her to pay costs personally; declared the
    trial unfair; and said there had been a miscarriage of justice. In oral
    reasons, he apologized to the parents “on behalf of the …system”. As a result,
    there are several secondary issues on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Children’s Aid Society, supported by the
    Children’s Lawyer, appeals the appeal judge’s orders as to access. The
    biological parents cross-appeal seeking declarations that there has been a
    miscarriage of justice. The impugned trial counsel cross-appeals the findings
    of ineffective assistance and the costs award against her. Legal Aid Ontario
    obtained intervener status on the costs award.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal by the Children’s Aid Society and restore the trial judge’s
    determination of no access. I would dismiss the parents’ cross-appeal. I would
    allow counsel’s appeal as to ineffective assistance and costs. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>THE FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>C.T. (“the mother”) and J.B. (“the father”) are
    the biological parents of a child born January 12, 2007. This child was not the
    mother’s first. Another child, who is an adult and not part of these
    proceedings, had been previously removed from her care after the child was
    found in need of protection largely as a result of the effects of the mother’s substance
    and alcohol abuse. That child was successfully placed for adoption. In this way,
    the mother was known to the child welfare authorities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2006 the </span>Children’s Aid Society of the
    Regional Municipally of Waterloo (“the Society”)<span lang=EN-US> received a
    referral from a public health nurse who learned that the mother was pregnant
    again. Shortly after the child’s birth, the mother tested positive for
    marijuana. A nurse observed the mother’s speech to be slurred. Although the
    child remained in her mother’s care, there were incidents of police involvement
    as a result of domestic violence reports. There were also ongoing reports to
    the Society about the mother’s alleged use of drugs in the presence of the
    child. A series of hair screens completed on the child in 2010 and 2011 showed
    positive results for cocaine and marijuana. In January 2012 the father told the
    Society that the mother was “prostituting herself.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In May 2012 the parents and the Society agreed
    that the child should be found in need of protection. The parents signed a
    Statement of Agreed Facts. The Statement outlined and summarized the background
    including the following: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>i<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From 2002 to 2012 there were ongoing issues regarding the parents’ drug
    usage;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>ii<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother was involved in the sex trade industry;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>iii<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were incidents of domestic violence between the parents;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>iv<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother had mental health issues including bipolar disorder and
    personality disorder; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>v<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The father was diagnosed with chronic pain, dysrhythmias, and panic
    disorder;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>vi<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since February 2012, the father has had only supervised visits with the
    child and further access would be at the discretion of the Society; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet>vii<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The child is not an Indian or native person. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Upon the finding that the child was in need of
    protection, she remained in the mother’s care subject to a supervision order.
    One of the conditions of the order required the mother to abstain from illegal
    drug use. In September 2012 the mother tested positive for cocaine and the
    child was apprehended.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Society commenced a status review
    application seeking 8 months’ Society wardship. In July 2013 the Society
    amended its status review application to seek Crown wardship, no access,
    following another Motherisk test showing that both the mother and the child
    tested positive for cocaine.</span></p>
  <h2>The Trial </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The amended status review application proceeded
    to trial before Hardman J. for 15 days in 2014 and 2015. During the trial, the
    Motherisk drug testing came under scrutiny and the Ontario government
    commissioned an independent review of the drug testing program. In June 2015,
    after the trial ended, but before the trial judge released her decision, the
    child was placed with a proposed adoptive parent. On December 15, 2015 the
    trial judge released her reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made an order of Crown wardship,
    no access, for the purpose of adoption. She concluded that the child was still
    in need of protection. She detailed the reasons for her conclusion that the
    mother was not able to parent the child, including:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>i<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her failure to address her issues of mental health and emotional instability;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>ii<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her continued use of drugs and involvement with others in the drug
    lifestyle; </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>iii<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her inability to properly look after the child while in her care;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>iv<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her inability to recognize her responsibilities as a parent;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>v<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her inability to learn or gain any insight into her parenting problems
    or possible solutions;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>vi<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her inability to follow through with commitments made or expectations,
    including those of a court order;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>vii<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her complete inability to focus unselfishly on the child and the child’s
    needs;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>viii<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her
    inability to maintain a stable home and safe surroundings for the child; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>ix<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her inability to ensure that the child is not exposed to harmful
    activity or inappropriate people.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also set out concerns about the
    father’s inability to protect the child or meet her best interests. She found
    that he had issues with transience, physical and mental health, and drug use.
    He had not addressed his finances, his homelessness and his own health. He was
    unable to care for himself, let alone the child.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was aware of the fact that the
    Motherisk test results were the subject of scrutiny, controversy and complaint.
    She ignored the test results and placed no weight on them. She concluded that
    the evidence – apart from the Motherisk results – supported her conclusion that
    the best interests of the child were not served by placing the child with the
    mother or the father. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge considered access. She concluded
    that neither parent’s access was beneficial for the child. She found at para.
    211 that “[g]iven the parents’ difficulty in recognizing rules and boundaries,
    I would have concern about them undermining any placement with direct contact
    with the child.”</span></p>
  <p class=StyleHeading2NotItalic>After Trial</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bridgette Gratl represented the mother
    throughout the trial. She (together with father’s counsel) appealed the trial
    judge’s order. In June 2016 the mother terminated the solicitor-client
    relationship with Gratl.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In July 2016 the parents received an affidavit by
    Todd Perrault, a clinical investigator with the Office of the Children’s
    Lawyer. He outlined the views and preferences of the child and the adoptive parent’s
    position on access and openness. Following receipt of Perrault’s affidavit, the
    parents amended their appeal to address only the issue of access. The child’s
    status as a Crown ward was thus conceded.</span></p>

  <h2>The Appeal</h2>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal was heard in the Superior Court in
    Kitchener for three days in early 2017. The appeal judge delivered oral reasons
    for his decision. The first 16 paragraphs of his reasons are a scathing review
    of Ontario’s child welfare system and an apology to the parents for the manner
    in which they were “treated, ignored, demeaned and disbelieved.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He considered fresh evidence including the
    affidavit of Perrault, which indicated that the child loves her parents, wants
    to see her parents, and also wants to be adopted by the proposed adoptive
    parent. By this time, the child had been with the proposed adoptive parent for
    almost two years and was flourishing. </span></p>

    stayed the execution of the order save for one visit to be followed by an
    openness hearing before him. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal judge outlined what he considered to
    be: a miscarriage of justice; the trial judge’s interference, bias and abuse of
    the trial process; procedural delay; and the incompetence of trial counsel. He
    invited costs submissions against trial counsel personally. </span></p>

    stay of the openness hearing, pending appeal. On April 28, 2017, Strathy C.J.O.
    determined that there was a serious issue to be tried, granted the stay and
    made the following endorsement at paras. 7 and 9:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[7]      In my view, there is also as serious issue to be
    resolved of whether the judge had jurisdiction to order an openness hearing
    before him in a region in which the Family Court does not have jurisdiction. At
    paras. 94 and 95 of his reasons, he found that he had that jurisdiction, but
    did not elaborate beyond stating that he had a family patent. He did not
    address the fact that Kitchener-Waterloo is not a “part of Ontario where the
    Family Court has jurisdiction” within s. 21.8(1) of the <em>Courts of Justice
    Act</em>. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[9]      If the appellant is correct in its interpretation of
    the law, any openness hearing would be a nullity. The same result would follow
    if the judge has no jurisdiction to conduct the openness hearing. </p>

    judge to deal with allegations against trial counsel and the costs that might
    follow. Gratl together with Jane McKenzie, trial counsel for the father, asked
    the appeal judge to set aside his findings about their conduct. The appeal
    judge set aside his findings against McKenzie and ordered that all references
    to her ineffective assistance be expunged from his original reasons. His
    decision concerning Gratl was different. He resiled somewhat from his view that
    she had been “solely” responsible for a miscarriage of justice at trial, but he
    concluded that she was responsible for the mother not having access to her
    child for 14 months because she had not applied for access pending appeal. He
    ordered her to personally pay costs totaling $100,000: $50,000 to Legal Aid
    Ontario and $50,000 to new counsel for the mother.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made extensive factual and
    credibility findings relating to access. The appeal judge found no error with the
    trial judge’s determination of access. At para. 81 he said: “the trial judge
    may well have been correct”. And at para. 73, he found no overriding and
    palpable error by the trial judge. </span></p>

    review, the appeal judge changed the no access order after having found no
    error by the trial judge. The trial judge had made extensive findings of
    credibility and her conclusions on the best interests of the child were
    supported by the evidence. In <em>Woodhouse v. Woodhouse </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(1996)</span></em>, 29 O.R. (3d) 417 this court quoted
    with approval the concurring reasons of Cory and Iacobucci JJ. in<em> P.(D.) v.
    S.(C.)</em>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 141, at p.192:<em> </em> </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>On issues of credibility, a trial
    judge is uniquely well placed to make the necessary findings. An appellate
    court should, apart from exceptional situations, refrain from interfering with
    those findings.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Similarly, the trial judge is in the best position to assess
    evidence pertaining to the best interests of the child. It is the trial judge
    who not only hears the evidence but also has the great advantage of watching
    the demeanour of all who testify. It is the trial judge who can take into
    account the significant pauses in the responses, the changes in facial expression,
    the looks of anger, confusion, and concern. In the vast majority of cases as a
    result of hearing and seeing all of the witnesses, it is the trial judge who is
    in the most advantageous position to determine the best interests of the child.</p>

    errors should have ended the appellate inquiry. Instead, the appeal judge went
    on to consider the fresh evidence about access. As I will explain, the fresh
    evidence did not support overturning the trial judge’s decision. Nor did it
    satisfy the mandatory requirements of the <em>Act. </em></span></p>

    protection matter is undoubtedly more flexible than in other types of cases
    where the <em>R. v. Palmer</em>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 test requires the

    adduced at trial; (ii) the evidence must be relevant in that it bears on a
    decisive or potentially decisive issue; (iii) the evidence must be reasonably
    capable of belief; and (iv) the evidence must be such that, if believed, it

    L’Heureux-Dubé J. invoked the child-centered focus of the <em>Act</em>&nbsp;to
    conclude that the admission of fresh evidence in child welfare matters requires
    a “sufficiently flexible rule, where an accurate assessment of the present
    situation of the parties and the children, in particular, is of crucial
    importance”. Likewise, this court has said that it is important to have the
    most current information possible when determining the child’s best interests
    “[g]iven the inevitable fluidity in a child’s development”: <em>Children’s Aid
    Society of Owen Sound v. R.D.</em> (2003), 44 R.F.L. (5th) 43, at para. 21, per

    accurate assessment of the present situation” because the parents had not seen
    the child since the trial. In any event, once the appeal judge found no error
    with respect to access, the fresh evidence was of marginal value. As this court
    stated in <em>CAS Waterloo v. V.L.</em>, 2007 ONCA 113, [2007] O.J. 613, at
    paras. 13 and 14:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The mother submitted additional fresh evidence on this appeal.
    She has turned her life around in commendable fashion. However, at this stage,
    such evidence cannot change the result reached by both lower courts.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…. Time is an important consideration in the [<em>Act</em>] and

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition, there was nothing in the fresh
    evidence about access that was not before the trial judge. For example, the
    appeal judge said that he relied heavily on the fresh evidence, especially that
    of Perrault who said: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[the child] would like to see her mother weekly but would
    want the visits supervised at the Children’s Aid Society’s visiting centre. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[O]verall, [the child] was very clear that she wanted to be

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The same evidence was before the trial judge. It
    was not new. The appeal judge also exaggerated Perrault’s evidence by reframing
    the above extract. At para. 82 the appeal judge said: “I have evidence that
    [the child] <em>desires, expects, hopes and prays</em> for contact with her (both)
    parents.” [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal judge appears to have ignored the
    fresh evidence that spoke against access. The child’s therapist (Angela Harvey)
    and the adoption worker (Tecla Jenniskens) spoke of the negative effects that
    parental contact has had on the child. In their view, the negative effects

    eligible for adoption. In 2011, s.141.1 of the <em>Act </em>was amended to allow

    establishes a high threshold for ordering access. Section 59(2.1) sets out a conjunctive
    test:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b>Access: Crown ward</b></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2.1) A court shall not make or vary an access order
    made under section 58 with respect to a Crown ward unless the court is

  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) the relationship between the person and the

    access must not impair the child’s opportunities for adoption. Courts have
    interpreted the words “will not impair” to require that access not diminish,
    reduce, jeopardize or interfere with the child’s opportunities for adoption: See

    history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower
    incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and
    of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples. These matters,

    second is that the evidence of the parents’ conduct <em>apart from the test

    that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he threshold for a finding of real or perceived bias is
    high. It is a finding that must be carefully considered since it calls into
    question an element of judicial integrity. Indeed an allegation of reasonable
    apprehension of bias calls into question not simply the personal integrity of
    the judge, but the integrity of the entire administration of justice.</p>

    reasonableness: the person considering the alleged bias must be reasonable and
    the apprehension of bias itself must also be reasonable. The reasonable person
    must be informed and know the relevant circumstances, including the traditions
    of integrity and impartiality on which the judicial system is based. A mere
    suspicion is not enough.</span></p>

    essential components of a court’s determination when – as here – the
    impartiality of a judicial officer is under review. Instead he accepted appeal counsel’s
    submissions about the trial judge’s “tone” when that counsel was not present
    during the trial, looked at comments by the trial judge in the absence of

    against the mother’s counsel Brigitte Gratl. He cited complaints by the parents

    trial judge, was unwilling to explain, and did not have proper theory

    five-day hearing resulted. On May 30, 2017 the appeal judge varied his decision.
    I quote his reasons at para 53:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Having conceded that the “incompetent counsel” finding should
    be set aside for the reasons set out earlier, I have concluded that even though
    I cannot find that Mr. Gratl’s (<em>sic) </em>level of advocacy preceding and
    during the trial itself (including the period after March 17, 2015 until
    December 15, 2015) was of such a scandalous quality as to <span
class=Underline>solely</span> cause a miscarriage of justice, Ms. Gratl’s
    continuing involvement as [mother’s] counsel after December 15, 2015 until June
    23, 2016 <span class=Underline>did indeed </span>cause a miscarriage of justice
    and undermined any appearance of fairness or of justice. Had Ms. Gratl been
    attentive to her then-client’s interests, there is no doubt in my mind that a
    motion for access pending appeal would have succeeded and the parent-child
    relationship would have been continued (such as it had pre-December 15, 2015).
    It is solely and directly a result of Ms. Gratl that the relationship may never
    be successfully re-established. [Emphasis in original.]</p>

lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are several errors in this conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, having found no error on the part of the
    trial judge, the issue of ineffective assistance was moot. Ineffective
    assistance of counsel as a ground of appeal has a very narrow application. It
    is a ground of appeal. It is not a springboard from which an appellate court
    engages in a retrospective analysis of every aspect of a lawyer’s conduct. The
    far-reaching analysis in which the appeal judge engaged is more properly done
    in the context of a civil negligence action, with all of its procedural
    safeguards, or a disciplinary investigation by the Law Society of Upper Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-US>Since the trial judge did not err, there
    was no ground of appeal left to explore. There was no prejudice to the parents
    and thus no miscarriage of justice. In <em>R. v. B. (G.D.)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520,</span></em><em> </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>at </span></em></span>para. 29:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In those cases where it is apparent that no prejudice has
    occurred, it will usually be undesirable for appellate courts to consider the
    performance component of the analysis. The object of an ineffectiveness claim
    is not to grade counsel’s performance or professional conduct. The letter is
    left to the professional’s self-governing body.  </p>

lang=EN-US>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, it was not open to the appeal judge to
    consider counsel’s failure to apply for an access order after the trial
    judgment. The issue before him was the no access order at trial. In any event,
    I do not share the appeal judge’s view that the motion “would have succeeded”
    in the face of the reasons of the trial judge, and the opposition of the
    Society and the OCL.</span></p>

    it should also be reversed.  </span></p>
