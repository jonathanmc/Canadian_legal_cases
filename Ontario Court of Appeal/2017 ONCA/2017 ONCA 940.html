    Harrison S. Arrell of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury, on September
    22, 2015.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Fairburn J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 22, 2015, a jury found the
    appellant guilty of three counts of possession for the purpose of trafficking
    in oxycodone, percocet, and clonazepam. He appeals his convictions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The charges arose from evidence seized during
    the execution of a search warrant at the appellant’s home. The police located
    numerous prescription drugs. A search incident to the appellant’s arrest
    produced a cell phone. The police later extracted text messages said to be
    related to drug trafficking from the phone. The trial judge admitted the
    messages and instructed the jury that they could be used for the truth of their
    contents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal turns on two questions: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Were the text messages properly admitted into
    evidence?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Was the jury properly instructed regarding the
    use of the text messages?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The answer to both of these questions is yes. I
    would dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police watched the appellant’s home over a
    number of days. They saw people coming and going from his residence. A car
    would arrive, someone would quickly enter the residence, then leave, get back
    into the vehicle, and the car would drive away. The police believed this
    recurring activity to be consistent with drug trafficking. They obtained a
    search warrant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was home when the police executed
    the warrant. The police located oxycodone, percocet, and clonazepam pills
    throughout the residence. Some of the pills were in the wrong pill bottles and
    some were in bottles that did not correspond to the appellant’s name. The
    police also located drug paraphernalia. The appellant took responsibility for
    possession of the drugs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was arrested at home during the
    execution of the warrant. A search incident to the appellant’s arrest uncovered
    more pills, $5,000 cash, and a cell phone that was located in his pocket.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=FR-CA>THE TEXT MESSAGES <i>VOIR DIRE</i></span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police obtained a warrant to search the
    contents of the seized phone. The lawfulness of the actual search was conceded. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police located multiple text messages that
    had been sent and received over a three-day period, totaling 30 incoming and 10
    outgoing messages. For purposes of this judgment, the term “outgoing message”
    refers to those messages sent from the phone. The term “incoming message”
    refers to those messages sent to and received by the phone. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The admissibility of the outgoing messages was
    not in issue at trial. This was a reasonable position given that there was
    ample evidence that the outgoing messages constituted admissions by the
    accused: </span><em>R. v. Evans</em><span lang=EN-US>,</span><em><span
lang=EN-US> </span></em><span lang=EN-US>[1993] 3 S.C.R. 653, at pp. 668-69. Although
    the appellant testified before the jury that he did not use the text message
    function on his phone, denying any knowledge of the text messages that had been
    extracted, he accepted that the phone was his and it was on his person when he
    was arrested. There was also one incoming message addressed to “Art”,
    constituting further circumstantial evidence connecting the appellant to the
    phone and the text messages. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The outgoing messages in this case were classic
    admissions and, assuming relevance, would have been admissible as a party
    admission exception to the hearsay rule: </span><em>R. v. Foreman </em><span
lang=EN-US>(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 204 (C.A.), at para. 37, leave to appeal
    refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 199; </span><em>R. v. Osmar</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    2007 ONCA 50, 84 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 53, leave to appeal refused, [2007]
    S.C.C.A. No. 157; and </span><em>Evans</em><span lang=EN-US>,</span><em><span
lang=EN-US> </span></em><span lang=EN-US>at pp. 664-69. Standing on their own, though,
    the outgoing messages had no probative value. Their relevance rested entirely
    on their relationship to the incoming messages. As such, the incoming messages became
    the focus of the admissibility </span><em>voir dire. </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The incoming text messages originated from nine different
    phones. They included messages like: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>“Can I come by at lunch for a few p’s?” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>“[C]an i buy a few sleeping pills off you
    tomorrow? if u cant teext call moms cell love n miss u”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown elicited evidence during the trial
    proper that “p” is a common street term for percocet and that “oxy” is a common
    street term for oxycontin.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During the second day of trial, in the absence
    of the jury, Crown counsel expressed his intention to produce the text messages
    the following morning and then close his case. The next morning, defence
    counsel voiced his objection to the admissibility of the text messages for the first
    time, maintaining that they were implied assertions, the same as those at issue
    in </span><em>R. v. Baldree</em><span lang=EN-US>,</span><em><span lang=EN-US> </span></em><span
lang=EN-US>2013 SCC 35, [2013] 2 SCR 520. Defence counsel took the position
    that they were presumptively inadmissible hearsay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the trial judge expressed understandable
    concern about the timing of the defence objection, defence counsel said that he
    made a tactical decision not to raise the matter earlier out of concern that
    the Crown could take steps to remedy perceived deficiencies in establishing why
    the text messages should be admitted. As defence counsel put it: “it was my job
    to remain silent for fear that things could have been rectified”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge excused the jury for the day and
    embarked upon an admissibility </span><em>voir dire </em><span lang=EN-US>the following
    morning. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown called two witnesses. Sgt. Vuyk, the
    officer who had performed the work on the cell phone, was qualified on consent
    as an expert in the area of extracting text messages. Sgt. Vuyk’s evidence was largely
    directed at the question of threshold reliability. He testified that he had
    used two tools in the extraction exercise, one for outgoing and one for
    incoming messages. He then took the extracted messages and merged them into a
    single document in chronological order. He testified that the document
    contained every text message located on the phone. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Det. Bell, the officer-in-charge of the
    investigation, also testified. Det. Bell’s evidence was largely directed at the
    question of necessity. He testified that he did not take any steps to locate
    the individuals associated to the phone numbers for the incoming messages. He acknowledged
    that once the text messages had been located, he did not think it was necessary
    to follow-up with those who had sent the messages to the appellant’s phone. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Det. Bell had been involved in hundreds of drug
    investigations over the course of his career. While he acknowledged that a
    subscriber check could have been done on the numbers for the incoming messages,
    he stated that, in his experience, people operating in the drug subculture
    often have fake names assigned to their phones. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Det. Bell testified that at most he could think
    of three times when he had successfully convinced someone to provide a
    statement to the police and could think of no situation where a person had come
    to court to testify that they had purchased drugs from an accused. He explained
    that for those living in the drug subculture, “it’s almost the worst thing that
    you can be identified as, as a snitch or informant, so they stay well clear of
    that.” </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The Admissibility Ruling </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Defence counsel maintained that, because the
    Crown was seeking the admission of presumptively inadmissible hearsay evidence,
    it was for the Crown to bring an application for admission. The trial judge rejected
    this position, construing the application as one brought by the defence to
    exclude evidence. Accordingly, the application was “dismissed” with written
    reasons to follow before the end of the trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The written reasons were delivered two days following
    the conclusion of the trial. The admissibility analysis largely focused on the
    principled exception to the hearsay rule. Relying heavily on the number of text
    messages involved, and the unlikelihood that the declarants would testify about
    their desire to purchase drugs, the trial judge concluded that the twin
    criteria of threshold reliability and necessity had been met. He also found
    that the text messages were highly probative and had no prejudicial effect. The
    text messages were admitted as hearsay statements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The written ruling also appears to hold that the
    text messages were admissible as original circumstantial evidence, constituting
    “evidence of trafficking” under the “rule relating to documents in possession of
    the accused”. It should be noted, however, that the parties agree that the jury
    was only charged on a hearsay purpose for the messages. </span></p>

    messages contain implied assertions, akin to the implied assertion in </span><em>Baldree</em><span
lang=EN-US>, the only route to admissibility was the principled approach to the
    hearsay rule. According to the appellant, the trial judge erred in respect to
    both threshold reliability and necessity when he applied the rule. The
    appellant also claims that he was prejudiced by not learning the purpose for
    which the text messages were admitted until receiving the draft jury charge. </span></p>

    messages were used for a hearsay purpose, there was no need to consider
    admissibility under the principled approach to the hearsay rule. He encourages
    this court to find that text messages found on an electronic device located in
    the possession of an accused are </span><em>prima facie </em><span lang=EN-US>admissible
    for the truth of their contents under the documents in possession rule. If he
    is found to be wrong in this submission, then the Crown maintains that the
    trial judge committed no error in his analysis of threshold reliability and
    necessity. </span></p>

    that the lack of clarity about the purpose for which the text messages were
    admitted created unfairness and, essentially, resulted in a miscarriage of
    justice. Second, I will consider whether the incoming texts were admissible
    under the principled exception to the hearsay rule. This analysis leans heavily
    on <em>Baldree. </em>The analysis is of particular importance on appeal given
    that the texts were left with the jury as admissible for the truth of their
    contents. Third, I will consider whether the texts were admissible as documents
    found in the possession of the appellant. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel at trial advanced two alternative arguments for the
    admission of the incoming text messages at the <em>voir dire</em>:<em> </em>(a)
    admissibility for a hearsay purpose under the principled approach; or (b)
    admissibility under the documents in possession rule for a hearsay purpose and
    as original circumstantial evidence. </p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the trial judge ruled the messages
    admissible, with written reasons to follow, </span>defence counsel asked for
    clarification on the purpose for which the evidence could be used. He
    specifically noted that the Crown had advanced a dual purpose for admission.
    The trial judge replied that it would be for “whatever purpose the Crown is
    going to allege it’s going to be called for”, ruling that the evidence would be
    heard first. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On a few occasions over the next few days, defence counsel
    renewed his request for an articulation of the use to which the text messages
    could be put. The trial judge said that it would depend on submissions after
    all of the evidence had been heard. <span lang=EN-US>It was only after the
    draft jury charge had been distributed, at the end of trial, that it became
    clear that the jury would be permitted to use the text messages for a hearsay
    purpose. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As with all </span>admissibility<span
lang=EN-US> questions, the first issue to be addressed is the purpose for which
    the evidence is sought to be tendered. The answer to this question will necessarily
    inform the relevance of the evidence, the admissibility analysis to be
    conducted, and the legal conclusion reached: S. Casey Hill, David M. Tanovich
    &amp; Louis P. Strezos, </span><em>McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence</em><span
lang=EN-US>, loose-leaf,</span><em><span lang=EN-US> </span></em><span

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I </span>agree<span lang=EN-US> with the
    appellant that the answer to this question remained elusive until the end of
    trial, when the draft charge made it clear that the evidence was admissible for
    a hearsay purpose. Even so, I see no prejudice arising from the after-the-fact articulation
    of the purpose for which the evidence could be used. The record reveals that
    everyone proceeded on the assumption that the text messages were being elicited
    for a hearsay purpose. Moreover, the appellant has not suggested that he would
    have done anything differently had the trial judge earlier stated that the jury
    would be permitted to use the text messages for a hearsay purpose. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Whether the messages were admitted for a hearsay
    purpose or as original circumstantial evidence, the appellant’s position would
    have been the same. He testified that he did not use the text messaging
    function on his phone. He denied any involvement in the text messages,
    suggesting someone else must have been using his phone for this purpose.
    Regardless of whether the text messages were admitted for a hearsay purpose or
    as original circumstantial evidence, it is hard to imagine that the appellant’s
    evidence would have been any different or that the defence would have unfolded
    any differently. No suggestion to the contrary has been advanced. Quite simply,
    no prejudice resulted from the lack of clarity on this point. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is not to say, however, that this manner of
    proceeding should be encouraged. Although it is understandable and even
    laudable that the trial judge was concerned about moving this jury trial
    forward, and that defence counsel’s late-in-the-day objection to the admission
    of the text messages threatened its efficient progress, the purpose for admission
    should have been addressed at the outset and guided the approach to
    admissibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One can well imagine situations where a lack of
    precision on the purpose for admissibility might well cause prejudice. For
    instance, prejudice might result where a party takes a step that would not have
    been taken had the party known the purpose for admission in the first place. While
    the purpose for admission of evidence may evolve with the fluidity of a trial,
    it is open to the parties to raise these evolving issues as they arise. Although
    prejudice did not result in this case, this finding should not be construed as supporting
    a free-floating approach to admissibility. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defining feature of hearsay evidence is that it constitutes an
    out-of-court statement by a non-testifying declarant that is tendered to prove the
    truth of its contents: <em>R. v. Bradshaw</em>,<em> </em>2017 SCC 35, 349
    C.C.C. (3d) 429, at para. 1; <em>R. v. Khelawon</em>,<em> </em>2006 SCC 57, [2006]
    2 S.C.R. 787, at para. 56; and <em>Baldree</em>,<em> </em>at para. 30. The
    unknown people sending the text messages are the out-of-court declarants in
    this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Hearsay is presumptively inadmissible because of the accepted
    dangers arising from this type of evidence. Declarants may have misperceived or
    wrongly remembered facts, been unintentionally misleading in the account given,
    or knowingly made a false statement. Eliciting statements in the absence of
    declarants deprives the trier of fact of the opportunity to observe their demeanour
    and see the potential concerns over reliability fully explored: <em>Baldree</em>,<em> </em>at paras. 31-32; <em>Khelawon</em>,<em> </em>at paras. 2, 35; and <em>Bradshaw</em>,
    at paras. 20, 26.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The presumptive rule against the admission of hearsay evidence applies
    equally to express and implied assertions tendered for the truth of the
    assertion. The truth of an implied assertion “hinges on the truth of the
    declarant’s underlying belief”: <em>Baldree, </em>at para. 39. Both implied and
    express assertions elicited to prove the truth of “what the person not called
    as a witness is alleged to have asserted” trigger the application of the hearsay
    rule: <em>Baldree</em>, at para. 4. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For example, in <em>Baldree </em>the Supreme Court concludes that
    no meaningful distinction can be drawn between a declarant who says that an accused
    is a drug trafficker and a declarant who asks to buy drugs from the accused. The
    express and implied assertions of fact are the same: the accused is a drug dealer.
    When elicited for the truth of the assertion, they both constitute hearsay
    evidence and they are both presumptively inadmissible. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The presumption can be displaced only where the evidence fits
    within a categorical exception to the rule or satisfies the principled exception: <em>Khelawon</em>,<em> </em>at para. 42; and <em>R. v. Mapara</em>,<em> </em>2005
    SCC 23, [2005] 1 SCR 358, at para. 15. The principled exception focuses on the well-known
    criteria of threshold reliability and necessity: <em>Khelawon</em>,<em> </em>at
    para. 47. Even where these twin criteria are met, judges retain a residual
    discretion to exclude an out-of-court statement where its probative value is
    outweighed by its prejudicial effect: <em>Khelawon</em>,<em> </em>at para. 49. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the trial judge concluded that the text messages were

    that the trial judge also erred by failing to consider that the text messages
    were incomplete, I do not agree. During the trial proper, the Crown’s expert
    acknowledged that there may have been missing messages. Although he said that
    he had retrieved every message stored on the phone, he was unable to say
    whether there were messages that may not have been saved on the phone. Nor

    Crown had not, by that point, called evidence regarding the meaning of the

    little effort by way of interpretation. When considered in context, others also
    take on clarity. For example: “Cmon bud reply the ol lady is bugging she doesnt

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The documents in possession rule is one of long-standing: see <em>Rex
    v. Smart &amp; Young </em>(1931), 55 C.C.C. 310 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 313; <em>R.

    Securities Comm. v. Branch</em>,<em> </em>[1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, at p. 33. The rule
    applies to paper and electronic documents alike: <em>Ansari</em>,<em> </em>at
    para. 154; and <em>R. v. An</em>,<em> </em>2015 ONCA 799, at paras. 15, 17. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The rule is designed to permit the admission of documents in two
    different circumstances for two different purposes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the rule allows for the admission of documents found in personal,
    constructive or joint possession of an accused as original circumstantial
    evidence of their contents to establish the accused’s connection to or
    complicity in the matter to which the documents relate: <em>Ansari</em>,<em> </em>at
    para. 116. Second, where evidence exists that the accused has recognized, adopted
    or acted upon the documents found in possession, the documents may be admitted
    as an exception to the hearsay rule, allowing the trier of fact to consider
    them for the truth of their contents. As noted in <em>B.C. Securities Comm.</em>,<em> </em>at p. 33, “if the party in possession has recognized, adopted or acted on
    the document an admission of acceptance of its contents as true may be
    inferred.” </p>

    doctrine in <em>Turlon</em>. The court adopted as correct the following passage
    from Hodge M. Malek &amp; Sidney L. Phipson, <em>Phipson on Evidence, </em>18th
    ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2013), at 37-10, pp. 1326-27, which remains
    substantively unchanged today: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Documents which are, or have been, in the possession of a party
    will …  generally be admissible against him as <em>original (circumstantial)</em> evidence to show his knowledge of their contents, his connection with or
    complicity in, the transactions to which they relate, or his state of mind with
    reference thereto. They will further be receivable against him as <em>admissions </em>(<em>i.e.</em> exceptions to the hearsay rule) to prove the <em>truth</em> of their contents if he has in any way <em>recognised, adopted or acted </em>upon
    them.<em> </em>[Emphasis in original.] </p>

    on its face.… its admissibility depends on the </span><em>purpose </em><span
lang=EN-US>for which it is sought to be admitted” (emphasis in original). The
    key to the hearsay finding in </span><em>Baldree </em><span lang=EN-US>is that
    the court was satisfied that the declarant’s statement was elicited for the
    truth of the implied assertion, that Mr. Baldree was a drug dealer: see </span><em>Baldree, </em><span lang=EN-US>at para. 37. The majority specifically observed that the evidence
    was not tendered as “circumstantial evidence that the respondent was engaged in
    drug trafficking”: </span><em>Baldree</em><span lang=EN-US>,</span><em><span

lang=EN-US>does not stand for the proposition that anything that can be
    construed as an implied assertion is necessarily hearsay. This becomes even
    more clear when one considers that </span><em>R. v. Ly, </em><span lang=EN-US>[1997]
    3 S.C.R. 698, aff’g (1996), 193 A.R. 149 (C.A.), remains good law: </span><em>Baldree, </em><span lang=EN-US>at paras. 52-53.</span><em><span lang=EN-US> </span></em><span
lang=EN-US>In </span><em>Ly, </em><span lang=EN-US>the court commented upon the
    admissibility of an unknown declarant’s out-of-court statement, setting up a
    time and place for a drug drop. The statement was referred to as one of “intention,
    or a statement tendered to establish the alleged drug transaction, and hence
    not tendered for the truth of its contents”: </span><em>Ly, </em><span
lang=EN-US>at para. 3. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Baldree </em><span lang=EN-US>does not disentitle a party
    from seeking the admission of a document found in possession as original
    circumstantial evidence. This includes text messages. The critical question is
    the purpose for which the document is tendered. It is up to the party seeking
    to admit the text messages to clearly articulate the non-hearsay purpose for
    which they are admissible.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Of course, resort to this doctrine cannot
    constitute an end-run-around the hearsay rule. If the circumstantial value of
    the evidence turns on the truth of the assertion made by the non-testifying
    texter, then the traditional hearsay concerns will be present. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If, though, the relevance of the evidence does
    not depend on the truth of the assertion, the text messages may be admitted on
    the basis that they constitute original circumstantial evidence relevant to an
    issue at trial. By way of example only, text messages may constitute original
    circumstantial evidence connecting the accused to a location, transactions, or
    people, or demonstrating knowledge, state of mind and so on. I emphasize that
    these are only examples and should not be considered a complete or aspirational
    list. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The fact is, though, that at the end of trial in
    this case, the messages were used for a hearsay purpose. Reasoning backwards
    from how the text messages were used, the alternative basis for admission endorsed
    in the trial judge’s written reasons – original circumstantial evidence – does
    not accord with the purpose to which the text messages were ultimately put. As
    such, this basis for admission requires no further comment. </span></p>

    possession rule, which constitutes an exception to the hearsay rule, the Crown also
    argues that all of the incoming text messages constitute admissions that were
    “adopted”. He argues that the adoption crystalized in two specific situations where
    the appellant is said to have responded to incoming messages. </span></p>

    important to recall that the documents in possession rule speaks in terms of
    documents being “recognised, adopted or acted upon” (emphasis omitted), these
    reasons focus on the Crown’s argument of adoption: <em>Turlon</em>,<em> </em>at

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As above, documents can become admissions for the proof of their

    restatement of the adopted admissions rule, with the added requirement that the

    this case, the rule cannot justify admissibility on appeal. Despite this fact,
    as discussed previously, the text messages were properly admissible under the
    principled exception to the hearsay rule and the jury charge accorded with this
    purpose. I will now discuss the charge. </p>

    matters respecting the charge. He argues that: (a) given that by the end of
    trial the Crown had conceded that he could not prove that the appellant had
    read or sent the text messages, the trial judge was wrong to leave the text
    messages for a hearsay purpose; and (b) the charge was inadequate as it related
    to the dangers associated to the text messages. </span></em></p>

    position, the appellant latches onto Crown counsel’s acknowledgement in the
    pre-charge conference that he was “very clear” with the jury in his closing
    that he “did not prove absolutely that Mr. Bridgman read those texts that were
    incoming and we couldn’t say that he’s the one that sent them”. The relevant
    passage in the Crown’s closing argument is as follows: </span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>[S]omebody must have been
    comfortable enough to send that type of explicit message to Mr. Bridgman when
    they know that there is going to be receptiveness to it. Who randomly just
    sends out to the world a text message that – where that person wishes to engage
    in criminal activity. So, does that mean that Mr. Bridgman read it? No, I can’t
    prove that. Does this prove that Mr. Bridgman sent those reply messages? I
    can’t prove that, when you look at it in isolation, but when you look at the
    totality of it, the $5,000.00 of cash in the pocket, the oxycodone 80s in his
    pocket. … In my submission when you look at it as a whole, again … there is an
    inescapable and irresistible inference of one thing, that Mr. Bridgman is a
    drug trafficker. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The appellant maintains
    that this passage demonstrates that the Crown moved away from a hearsay purpose
    for the messages. I disagree. </span></em></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>In the context of the
    closing as a whole, the Crown’s position is clear. Although Crown counsel noted
    the obvious, that he could not prove that, standing on their own, the text
    messages were sent or received by the appellant, considering the evidence as a
    whole, the jury was well positioned to come to this conclusion. Crown counsel threaded
    this idea throughout his closing submissions, including posing the following
    rhetorical question for the jury’s consideration in response to the appellant’s
    evidence that someone else must have been using his phone for text messaging: </span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>But I have to ask you, is
    it reasonable to think that somebody is going to be a drug trafficker of prescription
    pills and use somebody else’s phone to engage in that business, hoping that
    they have possession of the phone when people reply or that they’ll have access
    to the phone when somebody might text them and say, hey, I need some pills now,
    at lunch? That defies common sense. </span></em></p>

lang=EN-US>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The Crown clearly advanced
    the position that it was the appellant’s phone and that he was the one using
    the text messaging function. </span></em><span lang=EN-US>The Crown did not
    resile from his position that the text messages came back to the appellant. Nor
    did he resile from his position that they could be used for a hearsay purpose.  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The Content of the Charge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant takes the position that there is a fundamental flaw in the trial
    judge’s charge. He argues that the trial judge erred by leaving the impression
    that the text messages were reliable hearsay, and that the jury should have
    been notified of the hearsay dangers affecting the ultimate reliability of the
    messages. I do not accept this submission. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    question of ultimate reliability is for the jury: <em>Khelawon</em>,<em> </em>at
    para. 3. Ultimate reliability is determined by the trier of fact, assessing
    whether and to what degree the statement should be believed and relied upon to
    determine the issues in the case: <em>Bradshaw</em>,<em> </em>at para. 39. This
    determination is made against the backdrop of all of the evidence: <em>Khelawon</em>,<em> </em>at para. 3. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    charge brought home to the jury their need to carefully consider the text
    messages. The trial judge commenced by explaining that hearsay evidence “occurs
    when one person tells you what another person says and that person is not here
    to tell you directly”. He explained that hearsay evidence is generally excluded
    because “it is not considered reliable” for the following reasons: “The person
    is not under oath, is not cross-examined and you cannot watch the person give
    their testimony in person.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    explained the dangers of hearsay evidence, the trial judge went on to explain
    that there “was an exception” in this case <span lang=EN-US>–</span> the text
    messages. The appellant maintains that by referring to the text messages as an
    “exception”, the jury would have understood this to mean an “exception” to the hearsay
    dangers. I disagree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Read
    in context, the jury would have understood the trial judge to be referring to
    an “exception” to what he had just described as the typical rule that hearsay is
    not admissible. His comment was immediately followed by reference to the same
    hearsay dangers he had just reviewed: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>There was an exception that you heard in this trial being the
    text messages to Mr. Bridgman’s cell phone. The people who made these texts are
    unknown and they were not here to tell you the context in which these texts
    were sent, what they meant, <em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>or even if
    they were meant for Mr. Bridgman</span></u></em>.<em> </em>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then reviewed for the jury the Crown and defence positions
    respecting the messages, positions that were repeated later in the charge when
    summarizing the global positions of counsel. The trial judge specifically
    adverted to the defence position regarding the absence of reliability attaching
    to the record of text messages later in his charge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    hearsay portion of the charge was completed with the following observation: “It
    is for you to decide how much or how little you rely on this evidence but I
    emphasize it is only one part of all the evidence you heard and you must
    consider all of the evidence in reaching your decision.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    the end of the charge on hearsay, the jury knew to treat the text messages with
    caution, knew the dangers associated to them, and knew that they had to
    consider whether they were even meant for the appellant. The jury charge was
    adequate to the task. </p>
  <p class=Heading>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
