    with a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his conviction on a charge of sexual assault. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant, the appellant and the appellant’s girlfriend went out
    for the evening. Everyone was drinking. They returned to the residence shared
    by the appellant and his girlfriend late that evening. The complainant and the
    appellant had both had a lot to drink. The complainant eventually went to bed
    by herself in the spare bedroom. She had her pants on when she fell asleep. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant awoke early the next morning. She did not have her pants
    on and she felt wetness underneath her. The complainant spoke to her mother who
    recommended that she call the rape crisis centre. The complainant did so and,
    at the suggestion of the people at the crisis centre, she went to the hospital.
    The complainant underwent a complete sexual assault examination. The test
    results confirmed sexual activity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several months later, at the request of the police, the appellant voluntarily
    provided a DNA sample. A DNA comparison confirmed that the appellant had
    engaged in sexual activity with the complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that she was asleep after she went to bed and
    had no recollection of having sex with the appellant. She was adamant that she
    would never have consented to having sex with her friend’s boyfriend. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant accepted, in light of the forensic evidence, that he had
    sex with the complainant. He also had no recollection of the activity. He was
    equally adamant that he would not have had non-consensual intercourse with
    anybody. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are three grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>1.       Did the Trial Judge Misdirect the Jury on the Requirement
    that the Appellant Had to “Know” that the Complainant was not Consenting to Sexual
    Intercourse?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to adequately define
    knowledge and failed to tell the jury that the Crown had to prove knowledge
    beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge’s instructions are found at pages
    555 and 556 of the transcript. He told the jury in plain, clear language that
    knowledge of the absence of consent was an essential element of the offence. He
    equated knowledge of the absence of consent with the awareness on the part of
    the appellant that the complainant was not consenting. He also specifically
    told the jury that the reasonable doubt obligation on the Crown applied to the
    question of knowledge of the absence of consent. In our view, the charge was accurate. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber>2.       Did the Trial Judge Err
    in his Instruction on Circumstantial Evidence?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the evidence that the complainant did not
    consent to the sexual activity was circumstantial and that the instructions did
    not make it clear to the jury that the jury could convict only if satisfied
    that the inference that the complainant did not consent was the only available
    reasonable inference. Counsel also submits that the trial judge mischaracterized
    the evidence on the question of non-consent as “mostly” direct evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in the instructions on circumstantial evidence. Nor in our view
    was the evidence that the complainant did not consent circumstantial. She
    testified that she was asleep when the sexual activity occurred. If the jury
    believed that evidence, the jury would, without drawing any further inference
    from that evidence, conclude that she had not consented to the sexual activity.
    A person who is asleep cannot consent to sexual activity: <em>R. v. J.A.</em>,
    2011 SCC 28. If the jury believed the complainant and concluded that she was
    asleep at the relevant time, it followed without the need to draw any inference
    that the complainant did not consent to the sexual activities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
    cross-examination of the complainant, and in the appellant’s evidence, the
    defence put forward a different version of the events. The defence claimed that
    the complainant was awake and consented to the sexual activity, but could not
    recall the events in the morning because of alcohol induced memory loss. That
    position was open on the evidence, and was put to the jury by the trial judge. However,
    the defence contention that the complainant did consent but did not recall
    consenting, did not turn the complainant’s direct evidence that she was asleep into
    circumstantial evidence that she did not consent. The defence position simply
    presented its version of the relevant events for the jury to consider. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s case on the issue of the absence of consent rested largely on the
    complainant’s direct evidence that she was asleep and therefore incapable of
    consenting to the sexual activity. The jury instructions were adequate and in
    our view reveal no error in respect of the instruction on circumstantial
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=Heading>3.       Was the Verdict Unreasonable?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence in this case was certainly unusual. Both the appellant and the
    complainant professed to have no recollection of the sexual encounter. The
    complainant denied that she would have agreed to sex with the appellant. The
    appellant denied he would have had non-consensual sex with anyone. The case
    turned very much on the credibility of these two witnesses and the application
    of the burden of proof to the credibility assessments made by the jury. If the
    jury believed the complainant that she was asleep when the sexual activity
    occurred, it could reasonably convict the appellant. In our view it was not unreasonable
    to believe the evidence of the complainant. The verdict is therefore not
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed. </p>
