style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On September 12, 2013, the appellant, Jordan McPhee,
    threw a single punch at Kevin Dhillon, his cellmate at the Maplehurst
    Correctional Facility. The punch landed on Dhillon’s face, beside his left eye,
    and broke his orbital bone. Dhillon required surgery as a result. </span></p>

    Canada</span></i><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46</span><span

  <p style='

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that his conviction should
    be vacated and a new trial ordered in accordance with s. 686(5) of the </span><i>Criminal </i><i>Code</i><span lang=EN-US>, or, in the alternative, that a conviction for
    the included offence of assault causing bodily harm under s. 267(b) of the </span><i>Criminal </i><i>Code</i><span lang=EN-US> should be substituted. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant made home-made alcohol in potato chip bags or garbage bags
    that he kept in his bunk in the cell. The fermenting process attracted fruit
    flies and produced an odour. Dhillon found this disturbing.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the day of the incident, around lunchtime, the appellant and Dhillon
    returned to their cell. The appellant and Dhillon recounted different versions
    of what happened after that. </p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>without warning, the appellant climbed down the ladder from the

  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that: </p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>upon their return to the cell, Dhillon invited him to fight; </p>
  <p style='

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant came down the ladder from the upper bunk, facing
    inward towards the bunks; </p>
  <p style='

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dhillon, who was standing about a foot to a foot and a half away,
    threw the first punch with his right arm and a second with his left; </p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dhillon’s punches either did not land or grazed the appellant’s
    shoulder; and</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant then came out of a crouch and hit Dhillon, with all
    of his strength, “with a right”, like a roundhouse punch, where Dhillon’s left
    eye met his cheekbone, knowing that the bones in that area were very fragile
    and vulnerable.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was common ground at trial that the appellant punched Dhillon in the
    face, thereby breaking his orbital bone. The issues at trial were whether the
    defence of self-defence or consent precluded a conviction, and whether what
    occurred constituted “maiming” as referred to in s. 268 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the defence of consent was not available. This
    conclusion is not challenged on this appeal. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also concluded that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    none of the three elements of self-defence were present. Thus, the defence of
    self-defence was not available. The appellant challenges this conclusion in
    several respects, which I will discuss further below. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge concluded that what had occurred constituted “maiming” on each
    of what he described as the two possible definitions of that word established
    by the jurisprudence. First, the extent of the damage to Dhillon rendered him
    unable to fight back; and, second, Dhillon lost, to some extent, the ability to
    focus his eyes as a result of his injury.</p>
  <p style='
line-height:100%;page-break-after:avoid'><b><span
style='line-height:100%'>II. THE ISSUES ON APPEAL </span></b></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    erred in his assessment of whether the single punch the appellant threw at
    Dhillon was “reasonable in the circumstances” (the third element of
    self-defence) pursuant to s. 34(1)(c) of the <i>Criminal Cod</i><i>e</i>. </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge

  <span style='line-height:100%'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span

  </p>
  <pCxSpMiddle style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%'>
  <span style='line-height:100%'>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:100%'>failing to consider and weigh the specific and
  inherent frailties in Dhillon’s evidence, contrary to <i>R. v. McGown</i>, 2016
  ONCA 575, 341 C.C.C. (3d) 53; and</span>
  </p>
  <pCxSpLast style='text-align:justify;
line-height:100%'>
  <span style='line-height:100%'>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='line-height:100%'>relying on factors that were not capable of
  corroborating the material aspects of Dhillon’s evidence.</span>
  </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, a conviction for the included offence of assault
    causing bodily harm should be substituted. The first definition of “maiming”
    adopted by the trial judge – whether the bodily harm to Dhillon was to such an
    extent that it rendered him less able to fight back or defend himself – was
    wrong in law. As to the second definition, there was no evidence that Dhillon
    lost the use of some part of his body on a permanent basis.  </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue – whether the trial judge erred in his credibility assessment in
    any of the ways alleged by the appellant – only arises if I conclude that the
    trial judge erred <span style='line-height:100%'>in his assessment of whether
    the single punch the appellant threw at Dhillon was “reasonable in the
    circumstances”. This is so for two reasons. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    an accused person cannot rely on the defence of self-defence if the Crown
    disproves <u>any one</u> of the three elements of self-defence beyond a
    reasonable doubt: <i>R. v. Cormier</i>, 2017 NBCA 10, 348 C.C.C. (3d) 97, at
    para. 40.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> The three elements of self-defence are set out in s. 34(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>34 (1) A person is not guilty of an offence if</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) they believe on reasonable grounds that force
    is being used against them or another person or that a threat of force is being
    made against them or another person;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) the act that constitutes the offence is
    committed for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other
    person from that use or threat of force; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(c) the act committed is reasonable in the
    circumstances.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>If I conclude that the trial
    judge did not err in his assessment of the third element of self-defence – <i>i.e.</i><i> </i>whether the act committed was reasonable in the circumstances – then the
    defence of self-defence fails. It is not necessary to consider the trial
    judge’s assessment of any other element. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in contrast with his analysis of the other elements of self-defence, the trial
    judge considered the third element (whether the act committed was reasonable in
    the circumstances), and the factors set out under s. 34(2), <u>assuming the
    facts as related by the appellant in his testimony were accurate</u>.
    Therefore, any of the errors that may have occurred in the trial judge’s
    credibility assessment do not affect his analysis of the third element of
    self-defence. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these reasons, I ultimately conclude that the trial judge did not err in
    determining, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the punch administered by the
    appellant was not reasonable in the circumstances and therefore that the third
    element of self-defence was absent. Accordingly, the defence of self-defence
    fails. Given this conclusion, it will not be necessary to go on to consider
    whether the trial judge erred in his credibility assessment in the course of
    his analysis of the other two elements of self-defence – <i>i.e.</i><i> </i>(1)
    that the appellant believed on reasonable grounds that there was a threat of
    force being made against him, and (2) that the punch delivered by the appellant
    was for the purpose of defending or protecting himself from the use or threat
    of force. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below,
    I first address the trial judge’s analysis of the third element of self-defence
    – whether the act committed by the appellant was reasonable in the
    circumstances – and then turn to the “maiming” issue.</p>

  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) the nature of the force or threat;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    portion of the trial judge’s reasons in which he analyses the question of
    whether the act committed by the appellant was reasonable in the circumstances
    is at paras. 170 to 176:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[170] In any event, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the act committed was not reasonable in the circumstances.  In coming to
    that conclusion, I have considered the factors set out in section 34(2) of the <em>Code</em>. 
    I have considered those factors assuming the facts as related by Mr. McPhee are
    accurate. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[171] It would not have been reasonable to administer the punch
    delivered by Mr. McPhee having regard to the nature of the threat by Mr.
    Dhillon.  According to Mr. McPhee, Mr. Dhillon had invited conflict, by saying
    “do you want to take it to the back?” and “do you want me to come up there?” 
    Mr. McPhee responded, he says, by descending from his bunk.  If there was a threat
    at that stage, he could have simply stayed where he was.  Even after he
    descended, according to him, there was an attempted punch, or two punches, by
    Mr. Dhillon that missed the mark.  It was totally unnecessary in the
    circumstances to deliver a blow that disabled Mr. Dhillon.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[172] There were ample other means available to respond to the
    potential use of force.  As noted, Mr. McPhee could have simply stayed in his
    bunk.  He could have called for help.  He could have just ignored Mr. Dhillon. 
    Even after he descended from his bunk, once Mr. Dhillon missed the mark, he
    could still have called for help or grabbed Mr. Dhillon without punching him. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[173] As noted earlier, Mr. McPhee is taller and heavier than
    Mr. Dhillon.  He would have an advantage in any physical confrontation. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[174] There had been no prior use or threat of force.  While
    there had been some conflict between them, there had been no suggestion of any
    physical confrontation. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[175] The response by Mr. McPhee, if that is what it was, was
    totally out of proportion to Mr. Dhillon’s ineffectual punches that did not
    land.  As noted earlier, other options were clearly available. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[176] For these reasons, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the Crown has shown that the defence of self-defence is not
    available.</p>
  <p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by effectively

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by losing sight

  <p style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    determining whether the act committed was reasonable in the circumstances, s.
    34(2)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> required the trial judge to consider
    “whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of
    force”. In my view, this is exactly what the trial judge did at para. 172 of
    his reasons. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    s. 34(2)(g) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> required the trial judge to consider
    “the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat
    of force”. In doing so, the trial judge did not impose upon the appellant a
    requirement that he weigh “the exact measure of necessary defensive action” to
    a nicety or hold him “to a standard of perfection”, contrary to this court’s
    decisions in <i>R. v. Baxter</i> (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), at p.
    111, and <i>R. v. Cunha</i>, 2016 ONCA 491, 337 C.C.C. (3d) 7, at para. 24. Nor
    did the trial judge reason backwards from the injury Dhillon sustained to a
    finding of excessive force. </p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>As the trial judge recounted, on the appellant’s version of events,
    the appellant chose to descend from his bunk and engage with Dhillon and then punched
    Dhillon in the left eye area in response to two ineffectual punches that did
    not land. This was not a situation where, in the heat of the moment, an accused
    fails to “weigh to a nicety” the force he uses in response to the perceived use
    or threat of force. Here, the appellant, who testified he was not afraid of
    Dhillon, chose to engage with Dhillon and then weighed the force that he
    decided to apply in response to Dhillon’s ineffectual punches. Specifically,
    the appellant testified that he used all his strength to administer the blow,
    and he directed it to where Dhillon’s left eye met his cheekbone, knowing that
    the bones in that area were very fragile and vulnerable. The trial judge
    assessed proportionality on this basis. In this context, I read the trial
    judge’s description of the blow at para. 171 as one “that disabled [Dhillon]”
    as an attempt to reflect the amount of force used, and, therefore, the nature
    of the blow generally, and not as an indication that the trial judge reasoned
    backwards from the consequences of the blow in assessing proportionality. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion on this first issue, I am of the view that the trial judge did not
    err in his assessment of whether the punch thrown by the appellant was
    reasonable in the circumstances. Thus, the defence of self-defence fails, and it
    is not necessary to go on to consider whether the trial judge erred in his
    credibility assessment. </p>

    concluded that there were two possible definitions of the word “maim”. He
    wrote, at para. 155:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>One contemplates that a </span>complainant<span
lang=EN-US> has lost the use of some part of the body or bodily function, and
    the other is where the assailant causes bodily harm to the victim to such an
    extent that it renders the victim less able to fight back or to defend himself
    or herself. The latter meaning has clearly been established here. The extent of
    damage to [Dhillon] clearly rendered him unable to fight back. However, it has
    also been established that [Dhillon] has lost, to some extent, the ability to
    focus his eyes as result of his injury. That is sufficient to constitute
    maiming; see </span><em>R. v. Stehniy</em><span lang=EN-US>, [2010 ONCA 269].</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To recap, the trial judge applied two
    definitions of “maim” to the facts in this case. The first definition of “maim”
    applied by the trial judge requires “bodily harm to the victim to such an
    extent that it renders the victim less able to fight back or to defend himself
    or herself.” The second definition applied by the trial judge requires the loss
    of “the use of some part of the body or bodily function”. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that </span><em><span

    the first definition of “maim” applied by the trial judge – </span><em><span
style='line-height:100%'>i.e. </span></em><span lang=EN-US>“bodily harm to the
    victim to such an extent that it renders the victim less able to fight back or
    to defend himself or herself.” The appellant submits that </span><em><span
style='line-height:100%'>Schultz</span></em><span lang=EN-US> was wrongly
    decided, and therefore the first definition of “maim” applied by the trial
    judge was wrong in law. He argues that if this were the standard for maiming,
    most cases of assault causing bodily harm would be artificially elevated to
    aggravated assault. He submits that the correct standard requires that the
    person lose the use of some part of his or her body, coupled with proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt that the person’s loss of the body part or function is, or
    will be, permanent. He argues that the evidence in this case falls well short
    of that standard.</span></p>

    correctly found that there are two possible definitions of the word “maim”, and
    it was open to him to find that the evidence met both definitions in this case.
    The first definition is satisfied because Dhillon testified that he could not
    do anything physical after the appellant struck him. With respect to the second
    definition, the respondent acknowledges that Dhillon regained his eyesight and
    did not lose the ability to focus his eyes as a result of his injury, and the
    trial judge therefore erred in finding otherwise. However, the respondent
    submits that the second definition applied by the trial judge is satisfied by
    Dhillon’s testimony that his eye twitches and cannot adjust to sunlight, and
    that, as a consequence of the surgery on his eye, he feels numbness, “like some
    sort of pain”, on top of his gums, all the time. </span></p>

    be lost – specifically, the ability to fight back or defend oneself. I agree
    with the appellant that whether or not a victim has been maimed should not turn
    on whether the bodily harm inflicted upon the victim rendered the victim less
    able to fight back or to defend himself or herself. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>The distinction between wound and mayhem was of procedural
    importance. The man who had been maimed, that is, who had been deprived of the
    use of a member which would be serviceable in a fight, was not bound to offer
    or accept battle. In such case one or other of the parties was sent to the
    ordeal, until the Lateran Council of 1215 abolished that mode of trial; in
    later days the appellee had to submit to the verdict of a jury. [Footnotes

  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-US>We are long past the days of trial by

    that the loss of the use or function of some part of the victim’s body affect
    the victim’s ability to fight back or defend himself or herself in order to
    constitute “maiming”. In my view, the second definition applied by the trial
    judge, with its focus on the loss of the use of some body part or some bodily
    function without further qualification on the type of body part or function
    lost, recognizes this. In essence, the second definition is the natural evolution

  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-US>This subsection’s inclusion of

    that it recognizes that the loss of the use or function of some part of the

    the fight in which the injury was sustained, rather than the victim’s ability
    to do so in future fights. This acknowledgement that permanence is not always required

    nature of the injury suffered by Dhillon. The appellant’s punch to the left
    side of Dhillon’s face broke Dhillon’s orbital bone. The nurse at the
    correctional facility who saw Dhillon before he was taken to hospital by
    ambulance described his face as “caved in”. The doctor who examined Dhillon
    before surgery described the fracture as significantly displaced and
    comminuted. The injury was not transitory. Corrective surgery was required.
    Following surgery to repair the damage, it took about one week before Dhillon
    could eat properly again and about two weeks before he could open his left eye
    and speak normally again. Moreover, even now, Dhillon’s eye twitches and he
    cannot adjust his eye to the sun. The latter issue affects Dhillon when he is
    driving, because he has to keep his eye down and cannot focus on the road. Even
    when driving at night, when lights are coming right at Dhillon, he has to look
    somewhere else because he cannot visually focus on the light. Dhillon also
    continues to experience pain in his gum area.</span></p>

style='font-style:normal'> I note here that the trial judge erred when he set
    out the elements of self-defence, because it appears that he required the Crown
    to disprove all three elements beyond a reasonable doubt in order to render the
    defence unavailable to the appellant. This error does not affect my analysis of
    the issues on this appeal. The error inured to the appellant’s benefit at trial
    because it held the Crown to an even higher standard than necessary.
    Nevertheless, the law is clear that the Crown need only disprove beyond a
    reasonable doubt one of the elements of self-defence for this defence to fail.</span><span

    para. 74, the preliminary inquiry judge cited <i>Schultz</i> to support the
    idea that “‘[m]aim’ means to injure a person to the extent that they are less
    able to fight”. Although the preliminary inquiry judge commented that assault
    causing bodily harm might be the more appropriate charge on the evidence given
    that the complainant’s injuries “involved some degree of bodily harm and not
    much more”, he ultimately concluded that there was some evidence that would
    meet the definition of aggravated assault by maiming because, after the
    complainant was hit on the head with a baseball bat during a fight, “he was out
    of commission in terms of further involvement”. Similarly, in </span><em>R. v.
    Armstrong</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2002 BCSC 1824, at para. 22, the trial judge was
    satisfied that the accused had maimed the first complainant because her
    injuries (a broken arm, two broken ribs and seriously bruised legs and arm)
    “resulted in [the complainant] being less able to resist the continued assault
    upon her and less able to defend herself.” The trial judge was also satisfied
    that the accused had maimed the second complainant because, although his
    injuries were less severe and did not affect him for as long as those suffered
    by the first complainant, the broken wrist suffered by the second complainant
    “rendered [him] less capable of defending himself”: at para. 26.  </span></p>
