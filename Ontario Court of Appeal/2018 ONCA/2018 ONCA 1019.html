  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is an appeal from conviction for sexual
    assault. The appellant maintains that his trial counsel provided ineffective
    assistance and that this resulted in a miscarriage of justice. We dismissed the
    appeal with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To succeed on an ineffective assistance claim,
    the appellant must establish the material facts upon which he relies, that the assistance
    was ineffective and that the ineffective assistance resulted in a miscarriage
    of justice, either by virtue of an unreliable verdict or an unfair trial. Deference
    is owed to counsel’s performance at trial and there is a “strong presumption
    that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional
    assistance”:&nbsp;</span><em>R. v. G.D.B.</em><span lang=EN-US>,&nbsp;2000 SCC
    22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 27;&nbsp;</span><em>R. v. L.H.E.</em><span
lang=EN-US>,&nbsp;2018 ONCA 362, at paras. 6-7. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are not persuaded that any of the alleged
    failings on the part of trial counsel amounted to ineffective assistance and,
    in any event, are satisfied that there was no miscarriage of justice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that his trial counsel
    failed to give him disclosure and failed to prepare him to testify. Trial
    counsel responds that the appellant was given disclosure and that any lack of
    preparation arose from the appellant’s own conduct. Trial counsel describes the
    appellant as having been very difficult to deal with and somewhat “cocky”. That
    description of the appellant is consistent with the trial judge’s observation
    that the appellant displayed a “swaggering pompous attitude” in court. It is
    also consistent with the appellant’s attitude during cross-examination on his
    fresh evidence affidavit, where he affirmed that counsel had him attend at
    counsel’s office to discuss his testimony. The appellant asked rhetorically,
    “what is there to discuss”? He said that he was intent on testifying in a way
    that was consistent with what he had told the police and others.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, if there was any lack of
    preparation, it arose from the appellant’s attitude (as reflected in the
    cross-examination on his affidavit in this court) and not a lack of effort on trial
    counsel’s part. Moreover, trial counsel cannot be blamed for the fact that the
    appellant’s version of events, as first told to the police, simply made “no
    sense” to the trial judge. Counsel cannot be blamed for evidence that is “inherently
    difficult to believe in several important respects”: </span><em>R. v. Dunbar</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2007 ONCA 840,</span><em><span lang=EN-US> </span></em><span
lang=EN-US>at para. 27. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also claims that trial counsel was
    incompetent by failing to obtain his medical and phone records. We disagree. As
    for the medical records, the appellant contends that he had a shoulder injury
    that would have made it impossible for him to have committed the offence,
    including ripping the complainant’s bra at the front and tearing a hole in the
    crotch of her tights. The appellant says that the purpose of the medical
    records would have been to substantiate his claim that his shoulder had been
    injured, making him incapable of tearing the complainant’s clothes. Notably, we
    see no support in the fresh evidence to sustain the proposition that the shoulder
    injury made it impossible for the appellant to have committed the offence.
    Moreover, the trial judge effectively accepted the fact of the injury and
    simply found as a fact that it would not take much strength or dexterity in the
    injured shoulder to tear the complainant’s clothing. There is nothing in the
    fresh evidence that belies that finding of fact. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for the phone records, the appellant says
    that they would have supported the fact that the complainant called him after
    he had left her apartment. In the cross-examination on his affidavit on appeal,
    the appellant acknowledged that he had a burner phone registered under a false
    name. Leaving aside the fact that it could have been difficult to obtain those
    records, there is nothing in the evidentiary record on appeal to suggest that
    the absence of the records gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. Indeed, the
    fact of communication between the appellant and complainant was clear and had
    been memorialized in text message communications, including the appellant’s
    response to the complainant’s suggestion of rape, that she had a good memory
    for an “uncomphous [unconscious] bitch.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also complains that his trial
    counsel should have confronted the complainant with a DNA report showing male
    DNA on her neck and left breast. The appellant contends that the DNA analysis
    would have undermined the complainant’s denial that the appellant had
    consensually touched and kissed her in that location of her body.  However, in
    light of the complainant’s evidence that when she awoke from a state of
    unconsciousness, her breasts were exposed and the appellant was naked beside
    her and penetrating her vagina with his penis, it is difficult to see how the
    DNA report showing male DNA in her breast area could have undermined her
    credibility or assisted his. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having regard to the suggestion that trial
    counsel failed to confront the complainant with inconsistent statements, the
    allegedly contradictory statements came from the notes of police officers and paramedics
    who attended the scene. It is not clear that the authors of those notes were
    recording what the complainant had told them firsthand. In any event, the
    alleged inconsistencies were on peripheral matters that could not have shaken
    the complainant’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial counsel’s conduct fell within the range of
    reasonable professional assistance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant acknowledges that this case turned
    on credibility. At the core of the trial judge’s reasons for rejecting the
    appellant’s evidence was her finding that his evidence made “no sense.” She
    concluded her judgment with the following observations:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>As I have stated, I do not believe [M.M.], nor
    do I find his explanation for these events to be remotely plausible. I fully
    accept that [M.M.] went to Toronto, to Ms. A.’s apartment, expecting to get
    sex. He knew she was drunk and messed up on drugs and that she wanted company.
    He added that together and concluded he would get sex; that was his
    expectation. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>However, I also accept Ms. A.’s evidence that
    she was vulnerable, intoxicated, and afraid to be alone. She thought [M.M.] was
    coming as a friend to help her. She was not expecting to have sex with him. I
    accept Ms. A.’s evidence that she passed out, and that she woke up to find
    [M.M.] naked in her bed, engaging in sexual intercourse with her.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt,
    based on all of the evidence that [M.M.] ripped Ms. A.’s bra and tore a hole in
    her leggings. I do not believe his evidence that he was physically incapable of
    doing so. It does not take enormous strength or dexterity to accomplish such a
    task, and all he had to do with his left arm was hold on, while his right hand
    and arm could do all the tearing.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I do not believe for a second that Ms. A. tore
    her own clothing after the fact, to frame [M.M.]. [M.M.] did that after she was
    unconscious, and he did so for the purpose of carrying out the sexual acts that
    were the only reason he drove to Toronto in the first place. Further, he did so
    without regard to the fact that Ms. A., completely unconscious, was not
    consenting. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    [M.M.] engaged in sexual acts with Ms. A., including penetrating her vagina
    with his penis, while she was unconscious, and knowing she was not consenting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This was a fair trial and there was no
