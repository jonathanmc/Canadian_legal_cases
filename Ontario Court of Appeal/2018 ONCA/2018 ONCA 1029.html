  <p class=Heard>Heard: December 7, 2018</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Kelly A.
    Gorman of the Superior Court of Justice on July 18, 2016.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Pardu J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant seeks leave to appeal from a
    global sentence of six years, before credit for presentence custody. He submits
    that the sentencing judge erred in her application of the sentencing principles
    mandated for aboriginal offenders by s. 718.2(e) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>. I agree and would reduce the sentence to a four-year global
    sentence before credit for presentence custody, as suggested by the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The nature of the offences</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 10, 2014, the appellant was driving a
    stolen Silverado in an erratic manner in a mall parking lot. After a short
    pursuit by police at a speed of 60-70 kmph he went through a red light and
    collided with another vehicle (dangerous driving, possession of a stolen
    vehicle). The Silverado was now inoperable. He went to another vehicle, a black
    Jetta, stopped at the intersection. The occupant of that vehicle tried to roll
    up the window. The appellant ordered him to get out of the car, tried to reach
    in to unlock the door and, according to the account of one witness, grabbed the
    driver by the shirt to try to get him out of the driver’s seat (attempted
    robbery). The occupant slapped the appellant, applied the parking brake and
    removed the keys from the ignition. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant went to another vehicle in the
    intersection, a Ford Explorer. He tried to open the driver’s side door for
    about 30 seconds (attempted theft).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After arrest, bolt cutters, pliers, a
    screwdriver, a hammer and a socket set were found in the stolen Silverado. These
    formed the basis for the conviction for possession of an instrument suitable
    for the purpose of breaking into some place.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The licence plate on the Silverado, a driver’s
    licence hanging from the rear view mirror and a GPS device and screwdriver
    found inside the vehicle were all stolen, and led to convictions on four counts
    of possession of stolen property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally the appellant was convicted of driving
    while disqualified.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge’s reasons</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The sentencing judge referred to the
    appellant’s aboriginal background, but ultimately concluded that because of the
    seriousness of the offences and the appellant’s criminal record, his history of
    intergenerational trauma and abuse would have no impact on the sentence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In every case
    there are both mitigating and aggravating factors. In this case, the mitigating
    factors are the fact that Mr. Martin is a man of First Nations and the survivor
    of intergenerational suffering. As the Pre-sentence Report records, Mr. Martin
    was the victim of sexual abuse, a witness to extensive domestic violence and
    longstanding substance abuse, personally and within his family. To say his
    upbringing was unfortunate is an understatement.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The aggravating factors, however, are
    numerous. Mr. Martin drove a stolen truck in a dangerous manner through a busy
    commercial intersection of St. Thomas, jeopardizing the safety of the public.
    He violently attempted to extract a citizen from his car in order to commandeer
    it to effect his flight. At the time of the offences, Mr. Martin was the
    subject of five separate driving prohibition orders. Additionally, his criminal
    record comprises 123 convictions, including 71 property offences, 11
    convictions for driving while disqualified and 10 convictions for violent
    offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge cited para. 79 of </span><em>R.
    v. Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688: “Generally, the more
    violent and serious the offence the more likely it is as a practical reality
    that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals and non-aboriginals will be
    close to each other or the same, even taking into account their different
    concepts of sentencing.” She then referred to </span><em>R. v. Ipeelee</em><span
lang=EN-US>,          2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433,</span><em><span
lang=EN-US> </span></em><span lang=EN-US>at para. 75, to note that “[s]ection
    718.2(e) does not create a race-based discount on sentencing. [It] does not ask
    courts to remedy the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in prisons by
    artificially reducing incarceration rates.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span lang=EN-US>Gladue</span></i><span lang=EN-US> factors</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant is a Mohawk, registered with the
    Six Nations of the Grand River. All four of his grandparents and two of his
    great-grandparents attended residential schools. Without going into detail, the
    appellant’s family and relationship history is fraught with alcoholism, drug
    abuse, cultural dislocation, familial dysfunction, poverty and physical and
    sexual abuse. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The author of a 2015 </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> report indicated,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>There is little question that Cameron Martin’s
    life path has been shaped and informed not only by the larger historic traumas
    impacting Six Nations, but also by the constellation of intergenerational
    effects linked with Indian residential schools.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The appellant</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant has a grade 12 education and
    several college credits. The sentencing judge noted that he presented as an “articulate,
    thoughtful man” who was exceptionally competent in the presentation of his
    case, and capable of higher education. He stopped consuming alcohol in 2004,
    and his spouse reports that there are no issues of violence towards her or
    their children. He has had seasonal employment but never full-time employment
    on a continuous basis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant has a lengthy record dating back
    to 1991 consisting mostly of property offences, and breach-type offences
    related to probation orders or conditions of bail. The most significant
    previous convictions consist of the following:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Some 11 previous convictions for driving while
    disqualified.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Convictions in 1999 for assault and uttering a
    threat for which he received two sentences of 30 days, consecutive to each other.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A global sentence in 2006 of ten months, in
    addition to five months of pretrial custody, for three counts of assault with a
    weapon and a count of uttering a threat and forcible confinement.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A previous conviction in 2012 for dangerous
    driving and flight while pursued by police.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 26, 2015 the appellant was sentenced to
    two years less a day, followed by probation, for assault and two counts of
    assault with a weapon. He had served just over one year on this sentence at the
    time of the sentencing now the subject of this appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The failure to give adequate weight to </span><em>Gladue </em><span
lang=EN-US>factors is an error of law: </span><em>R. v. Kakekagamick </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(2006),</span></em> <span lang=EN-US>81 O.R. (3d) 664
    (C.A.), at para. 31, leave to appeal refused, </span>[2007] S.C.C.A. No. 34<span
lang=EN-US>. In this case the error had an impact on the sentence imposed and
    appellate intervention is required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In my view the
    sentencing judge erred by failing to give tangible weight to the systemic and
    background factors present here which played a substantial part in bringing the
    appellant to court and which attenuate his moral blameworthiness. In </span><em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Ipeelee</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:
200%'>, the court noted at para. 84 the problems caused by unwarranted emphasis
    to paragraph 79 in </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:
200%'>: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The second and perhaps most significant issue
    in the post-</span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> jurisprudence is the irregular
    and uncertain application of the </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> principles to sentencing decisions for serious or violent offences. As
    Professor Roach has indicated, “appellate courts have attended
    disproportionately to just a few paragraphs in these two Supreme Court judgments
    — paragraphs that discuss the relevance of </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> in serious cases and compare the sentencing of Aboriginal and
    non-Aboriginal offenders” (K. Roach, “One Step Forward, Two Steps Back: </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> at Ten and in the Courts of Appeal” (2009), 54 </span><em>Crim.
    L.Q.</em><span lang=EN-US> 470, at p. 472). The passage in </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> that has received this unwarranted emphasis is the observation that
    “[g]enerally, the more violent and serious the offence the more likely it is as
    a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals and non-aboriginals
    will be close to each other or the same, even taking into account their
    different concepts of sentencing” (para. 79; see also </span><em>Wells</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 42-44). Numerous courts have erroneously interpreted
    this generalization as an indication that the </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> principles do not apply to serious offences (see, e.g., </span><em>R.
    v. Carrière</em><span lang=EN-US> (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 569 (Ont. C.A.)).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, consideration of </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> principles is not equivalent to a race-based discount, but rather
    recognizes the reduced moral blameworthiness resulting from the effects of
    intergenerational dislocation and trauma, and recognizes that aboriginal
    persons are disproportionately represented in the prison population. As the
    court stated at para. 75 of </span><em>Ipeelee</em><span lang=EN-US>,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Section 718.2(e) does not create a race-based
    discount on sentencing. The provision does not ask courts to remedy the
    overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in prisons by artificially reducing
    incarceration rates. Rather, sentencing judges are required to pay particular
    attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders in order to endeavour to
    achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in any particular case. This has been,
    and continues to be, the fundamental duty of a sentencing judge. </span><em>Gladue </em><span lang=EN-US>is entirely consistent with the requirement that
    sentencing judges engage in an individualized assessment of all of the relevant
    factors and circumstances, including the status and life experiences, of the
    person standing before them. </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> affirms
    this requirement and recognizes that, up to this point, Canadian courts have
    failed to take into account the unique circumstances of Aboriginal offenders
    that bear on the sentencing process. Section 718.2(e) is intended to remedy
    this failure by directing judges to craft sentences in a manner that is
    meaningful to Aboriginal peoples. Neglecting this duty would not be faithful to
    the core requirement of the sentencing process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here the offences were not of such gravity as to
    justify disregard of the systemic and background factors affecting the appellant.
    No one was physically hurt. The brief evasion of police at 60-70 kmph was far
    from the most dangerous driving this court has seen. The attempted theft and
    attempted robbery of two other vehicles in the intersection were brief,
    impulsive acts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This case is far from </span><em>R. v. Fraser</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2016 ONCA 745, 33 C.R. (7th) 205, where this court upheld a seven-year
    global sentence for an aboriginal offender who had sadistically tortured his
    domestic partner.  In  </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> the court upheld
    a three-year sentence for manslaughter. The sentence imposed here approaches
    the range imposed for manslaughter.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Trying to carve out an exception from </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> for serious offences would inevitably lead to inconsistency in the
    jurisprudence due to “the relative ease with which a sentencing judge could
    deem any number of offences to be ‘serious’” (</span><em><span

lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is common ground that a penitentiary sentence
    is required here, but consideration of the </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> factors can also have a bearing on the effectiveness of the
    proposed sentence. Here there is no reason to believe that a six-year sentence
    would have a greater deterrent effect for the appellant specifically or for
    other offenders than a four-year sentence. Section 718.2(e) emphasizes the
    importance of restraint in resort to imprisonment:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>A
    court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following
    principles:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(e) all available
    sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances
    and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be
    considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of
    Aboriginal offenders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The longest prison term previously imposed on
    the appellant was for two years less a day. A “jump” to six years is too much,
    having regard to the nature of the offences and the </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> factors. Section 718.1 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-US> mandates that a sentence must be proportionate both to the gravity
    of the offence and the degree of blameworthiness of the offender. In other
    words, a sentence must not “exceed what is appropriate, given the moral
    blameworthiness of the offender”: </span><em>Ipeelee</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para.
