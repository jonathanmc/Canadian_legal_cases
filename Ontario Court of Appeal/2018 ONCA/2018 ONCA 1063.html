  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice David Price of the
    Superior Court of Justice, dated November 10, 2017, with reasons reported at
    2017 ONSC 6762.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Pepall J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal addresses the recurring issue of striking out pleadings in
    family law proceedings in the face of incomplete disclosure. The appellant,
    John Sherlock, appeals from an order striking his pleadings and ordering him to
    pay the costs of the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal but would vary the
    order to augment the husband’s trial participation rights.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, John Sherlock, and the respondent, Katherine Ann Mullin,
    cohabited for approximately 13 years commencing in November 2000. They married
    in September 2012 and separated less than one year later on June 28, 2013.
    There are no children of the marriage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The husband is the sole officer, director and shareholder of GS Medical
    Packaging Inc. (“GS Medical”), a company that sells medical supplies to doctors
    and dentists. He owned and operated the company before the parties met. The
    wife was employed by GS Medical during the parties’ relationship and received a
    salary in an amount up to $78,000 per year. Her employment was terminated
    following the parties’ separation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As of the date of their separation, the parties jointly owned real
    property consisting of a matrimonial home in Mississauga and a condominium in
    Florida. They also jointly owned a boat.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Wife’s Application </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 13, 2013, the wife commenced an application against the
    husband. Amongst other things, she claimed spousal support and equalization of
    net family property, asserting a joint family venture and an entitlement to the
    value of 50% of GS Medical Packaging and other businesses that the husband had
    operated during their relationship. On October 11, 2013, the husband was
    ordered by Herold J. to pay spousal support of $3,000 per month.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 29, 2013, the wife served a detailed Request for Information
    on the husband, seeking extensive personal and corporate disclosure.  </p>
  <p class=Heading>November 25, 2013 Order </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 25, 2013, the parties agreed to the terms of a consent order
    which was granted by Sproat J. The order incorporated the requests made in the
    wife’s Request for Information. The husband was to provide the disclosure
    requested by the wife on or before January 9, 2014, or explain why it was
    either unavailable or arguably not producible. The very extensive disclosure
    ordered is described in Schedule A, attached to these reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the parties were to list for sale both the matrimonial home
    and the Florida condominium “as soon as practicable with agents and on terms to
    be agreed”. The wife continued to live in the matrimonial home in the meantime. </p>
  <p class=Heading>June 12 and August 11, 2014 Orders </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 14, 2014, the wife served another Request for Information based on
    information now sought by her forensic accountant, Jeffrey Feldman. On May 23,
    2014, the wife brought a motion to strike the husband’s pleadings for failure
    to provide that information. She subsequently amended the motion to seek
    additional disclosure. Further extensive corporate and personal disclosure was
    ordered by Trimble J. on June 12, 2014 and August 11, 2014, both on consent. The
    June 12, 2014 order required the husband to deliver responses to Mr. Feldman's March
    2014 Request for Information by June 24, 2014. The August 11, 2014 order required
    additional disclosure to be provided within 60 days. The details of both Orders
    are described in Schedule B. </p>
  <p class=Heading>September 1, 2015 Order</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 1, 2015, Emery J. made another order on consent. The husband was to
    allow the wife’s forensic accountant to re-attend at the offices of GS Medical
    at a date and time of his choosing and to provide him with certain disclosure
    by October 1, 2015. The details of this disclosure are described in Schedule C. </p>
  <p class=Heading>January 26, 2017 Questioning of Husband</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband attended for questioning by the wife’s lawyer on January 26, 2017.</p>
  <p class=Heading>April 3, 2017 Order </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    parties brought motions returnable April 3, 2017. The husband asked that the
    matrimonial home be sold pursuant to the November 25, 2013 order of Sproat J.
    The wife sought an order compelling the husband to provide answers to his
    undertakings given at his questioning of January 26, 2017 within 15 days, and
    directing him to return to questioning within 30 days to answer the questions that
    he had refused to answer at that questioning, including those that were taken
    under advisement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his April 3, 2017 order, the motion judge ordered the husband to answer all
    questions asked at his questioning of January 26, 2017 by April 26, 2017,
    including undertakings and refusals. There were 32 outstanding undertakings and
    12 refusals. The husband was also ordered to re-attend at his own expense on
    May 23, 2017 to answer questions arising from the answers that were to be
    provided by April 26, 2017. The April 3, 2017 order provided that if the
    husband did not fully comply with the answers to the undertakings and refusals,
    his pleadings would be struck. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    their significance to this appeal, paragraphs 5 and 7 of the motion judge’s
    April 3, 2017 order are reproduced below:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[5] The Respondent shall answer all questions asked at his
    examination of January 26, 2017, by April 26, 2017, including undertakings and
    refusals. With regard to the request for journal entries and petty cash
    vouchers, he shall provide an explicit and detailed statement in an Affidavit
    by that date setting out the following:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether the
    documents ever existed and whether they were in his possession, power or
    control;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>if they were but
    no longer are in existence or in his possession, power or control, when they
    ceased to be and under what circumstances;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>if they are in the possession of a non-party, who that is, including
    contact information.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[7] In the event the Respondent does not comply fully with item
    #5 above, his pleadings shall be struck.</p>
  <p class=Heading>July 5, 2017 Motion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 15, 2017, the wife brought a motion returnable June 15, 2017 asking that
    the husband’s pleadings be struck for non-compliance pursuant to para. 7 of the
    motion judge’s order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the motion was heard by the motion judge on July 5, 2017. The motion judge
    characterized the outstanding issue on the return of the motion as whether the
    husband had failed to provide necessary disclosure and to answer the questions
    he undertook or refused to answer on January 26, 2017, and if so, what remedy
    the court should impose. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Motion Judge’s Reasons</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons dated November 10, 2017, the motion judge itemized the documents
    that the husband had failed to provide, and noted that there continued to be certain
    refusals and undertakings that had not been answered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two outstanding refusals asked the husband to: a) provide a list of all travel
    done for business and pleasure since the date of separation, and b) provide
    documents confirming the purchase or sale of the jointly owned boat.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the first refusal, the husband’s response was: “All business trips: Dubai,
    China, Taiwan, Korea, Germany, England, and numerous cities within the United
    States.” In his reasons, the motion judge concluded that the husband had failed
    to respond to the refusal because he was obliged to provide particulars of the
    trips’ dates and purposes. He also found that the husband had not responded to
    the second refusal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the undertakings, the motion judge noted that: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband undertook to provide copies of the requests he made
    to three law firms to obtain a copy of any wills prepared on his behalf and to
    also provide the firms’ responses. He had provided a copy of a will and
    indicated that it was the “only will” but failed to provide copies of the requests
    made and the responses received.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The husband was to ask Ms. Fan, the accountant for the husband
    and GS Medical, about the source of the estimates for the balances of the loans
    from GS Medical in his first three financial statements as at the date of
    marriage and the date of separation, and to ask her how the loans to him from
    GS Medical were reflected in the company’s financial statements. The motion
    judge found that the husband had failed to ask about the source of the
    estimates and had responded that there were no further loans. The husband was
    also to ask Ms. Fan about the purpose and her knowledge of a letter bearing her
    signature and on her letterhead, describing the husband’s income from GS
    Medical in 2011 as being $454,500. The husband responded that Ms. Fan had not
    prepared or signed the letter. The husband was also to ask Mr. Peter Jarvis, another
    accountant, about the purpose and his knowledge of a comparable letter. The
    husband responded that Mr. Jarvis had no recollection of ever signing or
    preparing it. The motion judge found that the husband had failed to elicit
    either of the individuals’ knowledge of the letter. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the motion judge noted the husband had undertaken to provide any documents within
    his possession, power, or control that supported the values contained in his
    Financial Statements. He had failed to produce:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>bank statements supporting the value of his Capital Bank, U.S.
    chequing account as of the date of marriage and the date of separation;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>bank statements showing the balances of two additional U.S.
    chequing accounts at Capital Bank on the date of separation, as identified in
    his November 4, 2014 Financial Statement; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>bank statements supporting the value of his Scotiabank RRSP
    account as of the date of marriage; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>proof of the personal loan of $200,000 that he claimed to owe third-parties
    as of the date of marriage; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>documentation showing the amounts he claimed GS Medical paid for
    the advance for the purchase of the boat and for the purchase of the parties’
    Florida condominium, and which the husband claimed he owed GS Medical as of the
    date of separation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge struck out the husband’s pleadings on terms. He concluded that it
    would be highly unfair to require the wife to proceed to trial without
    information that served to reconcile the differing amounts shown for the loans
    from GS Medical as of the date of marriage and the date of separation found on
    the husband’s various financial statements. In his view the wife required this
    information to quantify the husband’s income and net family property and to
    establish her claims to spousal support and an equalization payment. Moreover,
    he found at para. 69 that the husband “sought to frustrate the court’s process
    by providing deliberately ambiguous and misleading answers to the questions he

  <p class=Heading>Positions of Parties </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband appeals from the motion judge’s November 10, 2017 order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His
    position is that striking a pleading is an order of last resort that should
    occur only in the most exceptional and egregious of circumstances, and that
    this was not such a case. He relies on this court’s analysis in <em>Kovachis v.
    Kovachis</em>, 2013 ONCA 663, at para. 34. He argues that, as in that case,
    before striking pleadings, “consideration ought to have been given to the
    importance or materiality of the items of disclosure…not produced”, and to the
    principle of proportionality. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband argues that the motion judge failed to consider appropriate alternative
    remedies to striking pleadings and failed to give effect to the objective of a
    sanction under subrule 1(8) of the <em>Family Law Rules</em><i>, </i>O. Reg.
    114/99. Moreover, the order made impedes the just determination of the case
    which requires a factual inquiry that necessarily involves the appellant’s
    participation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    he submits that the motion judge either mischaracterized or misapprehended the
    evidence:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in characterizing the husband as “not answering” outstanding
    undertakings and refusals;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in failing to consider that the wife did not give the husband an
    opportunity to clarify his answers in advance of serving her motion to strike;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in failing to consider that of the 32 answers to undertakings
    provided, only 8 were claimed to be unsatisfactory by the wife, and of the 12
    answers to refusals provided, only 2 were considered unsatisfactory; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in finding that the husband had “repeatedly breached the orders
    of this court for disclosure” including that relating to the boat proceeds and
    that he had done so “willfully, in a deliberate attempt to frustrate [the wife’s]
    efforts to establish her claims”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the wife’s position that the husband has breached every order made by the
    court in these proceedings. She argues that the motion judge properly
    considered other available alternatives and made an appropriate order in the
    circumstances. </p>

    at </span></em>paras. 11 and 12, Benotto J. A. wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The most basic obligation in family law is the duty to disclose
    financial information. This requirement is immediate and ongoing. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Failure to abide by this fundamental principle impedes the
    progress of the action, causes delay and generally acts to the disadvantage of
    the opposite party. It also impacts the administration of justice. Unnecessary

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Traditionally,
    striking pleadings has been considered to be a remedy of last resort. In <em>Purcaru
    v. Purcaru</em>, 2010 ONCA 92, Lang J.A. stated at para. 47 that in family law
    cases, pleadings should only be struck and trial participation denied in
    exceptional circumstances and where no other remedy would suffice. The same
    principle was reiterated in <em>Chiaramente v. Chiaramente</em>, 2013 ONCA 641,
    at paras. 31-33. Laskin J.A. described the relevant considerations in <em>Kovachis</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Before striking Kovachis’ pleadings, <u>consideration ought to
    have been given to the importance or materiality of the items of disclosure
    Kovachis has not produced</u>. Although full and frank disclosure is a
    necessary component of family law litigation, exhaustive disclosure may not
    always be appropriate. The courts and parties should consider the burden that
    disclosure requests bring on the disclosing party, the relevance of the request
    of disclosure to the issues at hand, and the cost and time to obtain the
    disclosure compared to its importance. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a family law case, as the resulting judgment may provide for continuing
    obligations that can only be varied on proof of a change in circumstances, the
    striking of pleadings has added significance. If pleadings are struck, a “change
    in circumstances may be difficult to establish if the initial judgment is based
    on incorrect assumptions, thus perpetuating injustice.” <em>Purcaru</em><em><span

    motion judge had complied with the requirements of <em>Kovachis</em> in
    striking the appellant’s pleadings, stating that he had properly assessed the willful
    non-compliance to be egregious and exceptional, and it was not a situation of
    overreaching by the wife. The motion judge had expressly considered proportionality
    by examining the disclosure made in comparison with the disclosure still
    outstanding. The motion judge scrutinized both the quantity of disclosure, which
    had been significant, and the quality, which was deficient in that it omitted basic
    documents such as income tax returns, financial statements, and credit card
    statements. </p>

    2015, Rule 13 of the <em>Family Law Rules</em> was amended to emphasize a
    party’s financial disclosure requirements. So, for instance, specified
    disclosure is required for a claim for support (Rule 13 (3.1)) or a claim under
    Part 1 of the <em>Family Law Act</em> (Rule 13 (3.3)). Under Rule 13(11), if a
    party believes that the financial disclosure is insufficient, the party shall
    first ask for the additional information and, if it is not provided within
    seven days, the court may order its production. Rule 19(1) addresses the need
    to provide an affidavit of documents 10 days after being requested to do so by
    the other party.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judges
    presiding over family law disputes are frequently faced with mounds of
    material, a busy court docket and pressure to process files expeditiously.
    Repeated and frequent motions for disclosure are often necessary, though they
    should not be. As stated by Benotto J.A. in <em>Roberts</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><i> </i>at para. 12, delinquencies add
    significant expense to proceedings and consume substantial judicial time and
    resources. Counsel and their clients should not expect that repeated
    adjournments and indulgences will be given to instances of non-disclosure. Furthermore,
    an effective remedy for inadequate or non-disclosure should be available.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, a litigation strategy that involves repetitive motions for disclosure
    untethered from the disclosure already made may give a false impression of the extent
    of the non-disclosure. It must be recognized that given the size and complexity
    of some estates, it may be easier to ask the question than to give the answer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the ongoing challenges presented by inadequate disclosure in family law
    proceedings and the need to provide a workable remedy while ensuring that the
    procedure is fair to all parties, a decision-making framework for the
    application of Rule 1(8) is required. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decision-making Framework </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    when faced with an allegation of failure to obey a disclosure order, before
    granting a remedy, the judge must be satisfied that there has been
    non-compliance with the court order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    once satisfied, a judge may have recourse to the alternatives described in Rule
    1(8). In assessing the most appropriate remedy, a judge should consider the
    following factors: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the relevance of the non-disclosure, including its significance
    in hindering the resolution of issues in dispute; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the context and complexity of the issues in dispute, understanding
    that an uncomplicated case should have little tolerance for non-disclosure,
    whereas a case involving extensive valuation of assets may permit some
    reasonable delay in responsiveness;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the extensiveness of existing disclosure; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the seriousness of efforts made to disclose, and the explanations
    offered by a defaulting party for the inadequate or non-disclosure; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>any other relevant factors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    considered these factors, the judge will then determine the best remedy. The
    orders identified in Rule 1(8) are not exclusive. Other approaches may be
    appropriate. For example, one option might be to invite the moving party to
    seek at trial an adverse inference from the failure to disclose and for the
    motion judge to memorialize this invitation in reasons for decision.  Parties
    frequently rely on another option, namely a request for an adjournment to allow
    for more time to effect disclosure.  Occasionally this may be appropriate
    especially in a complex case, but an adjournment should not be considered to be
    automatic. Fully compliant disclosure is the expectation, not the exception.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the judge decides to strike, as in the case under appeal, Rule 1(8.4) becomes
    applicable. As mentioned, this subsection provides that certain consequences
    apply unless a court orders otherwise.  Accordingly, a party is not entitled to
    participate in a case in any way unless the court orders otherwise.  This
    provision gives the judge the ability to frame the procedural consequences to a
    party in default. In making this determination, consideration should be given
    to whether the consequence is responsive to the breach and whether it achieves a
    just outcome.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the judge decides to strike, Rule 1(8)(c) does not refer to striking
    “pleadings”. Instead, it specifically distinguishes amongst striking out an
    application, answer, notice of motion, motion to change, response to motion to
    change, financial statement, affidavit, or any other document filed by a party.
    Rule 1(8.4) addresses the consequences if an order is made striking an application,
    answer, motion to change or response to a motion to change.  Ideally, when
    making an order under this subsection, the judge should specify what is being
    struck.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decisions to strike a document and to determine the parameters of trial
    participation are discretionary in nature, and as stated by Lang J.A. in <em>Purcaru</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 50, are “entitled to deference
    on appeal when exercised on proper principles. The exercise of discretion will
    be upheld where the motion or trial judge fashions a remedy that is appropriate
    for the conduct at issue.”</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Application of Legal Framework to this Appeal </h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to this case, the motion judge did not strike the pleadings based on paragraph 7
    of the April 3, 2017 order. Rather, he identified the issues on the motion as
    being whether the husband had failed to provide necessary disclosure and had answered
    the questions he undertook or refused to answer on January 26, 2017, and if so,
    whether the court should strike his pleadings, order him to comply with his
    undertakings, order him to attend for further questioning, or adjourn the
    motion until he had complied and finished being questioned. Contrary to the
    husband’s contention, the motion judge did consider other possible remedies. In
    addition, although he did not use the words ‘exceptional’ or ‘egregious’, he
    expressly stated that a remedy striking a pleading is a serious one that was
    available for unusual cases. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge properly concluded that the husband had failed to
    comply with his April 3, 2017 order. Although the husband provided the
    affidavit required by paragraph five of that order, he did not answer all of
    the undertakings and refusals ordered to be answered and, although the
    opportunity for further questioning of the appellant was available, the wife
    was not required to resort to further questioning of the husband to obtain
    those answers.  In having recourse to Rule 1(8), the motion judge assessed
    whether the non-disclosure was relevant and determined that it was. The
    information ordered was required to assist in establishing spousal support and
    the wife’s equalization of net family property claim. The motion judge was
    familiar with the complexity of the case and the disclosure made, but found that
    the husband had repeatedly breached court orders for disclosure and had done so
    willfully in a deliberate attempt to frustrate the wife’s efforts to establish
    her claims.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband submits that the evidence did not support an inference of intentional
    breach.  The motion judge was obviously not satisfied with the explanations
    offered by the husband for the failure to comply with his disclosure
    obligations.  The repeated orders and the repeated non-compliance readily
    permitted such a conclusion. The motion judge did not err in resorting to the
    strike out provision found in Rule 1(8)(c).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, in his reasons, the motion judge did not advert to what he was
    striking out. I would therefore vary the order to specify that the husband’s
    Answer is struck out, pleadings not being a defined term in the <em>Family Law
    Rules</em>. In addition, all other documents filed by the husband are struck
    subject to the discretion of the trial judge as to whether any are relevant and
    ought to be admitted, for example possibly Form 13 and Form 13.1 financial
    statements.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    the motion judge did decide that the husband would be entitled to participate
    in the case and thus invoked the “unless a court orders otherwise” language of
    Rule 1(8.4). However, the motion judge erred in his determination of the
    parameters of trial participation given the husband’s breach. As stated in <em>Purcaru</em> at paras. 49 and 50, the exercise of discretion required the motion judge to
    fashion a remedy that was “appropriate for the conduct at issue”. Here, there
    had been extensive disclosure and the outstanding undertakings and refusals
    were few. In the interests of achieving a proportionate and just outcome, I
    would vary the order to delete paragraph two which provides for an uncontested
    hearing.  I would augment the husband’s trial participation rights described in
    paragraph 3 to permit him to make an opening statement, cross-examine the wife
    and the wife’s witnesses at trial and make closing submissions without the need
    for leave of the trial judge. Any additional participation would only be as
    permitted by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband’s Answer contains his claims against the wife.  Striking out his Answer
    appropriately deprives him of the ability to pursue his claims.  My proposed
    variation of the order permits the husband to test the wife’s claims and also
    operates to provide the court with a richer record on which to base its decision. 
    In the face of the extensive disclosure on the one hand, and the willful
    non-compliance on the other, such an order serves to discourage non-compliant
    behaviour but is also proportionate to the husband’s actual non-disclosure and
    allows for a fair adjudication of the issues. Lastly, while the husband is at
    liberty to now comply with the provisions of the April 3, 2017 order, this would
    not operate to reinstate his Answer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, I would dismiss the appeal but would vary the terms of the order as
    described in Schedule D attached hereto. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Costs</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge ordered the husband to pay costs to the wife in the amount of
    $55,365.73 on a substantial indemnity scale for the motions heard May 29, and
    September 1, 2015, December 22, 2016, and March 1 and April 3, 2017. The wife
    had claimed $90,763.41. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband argues that the cost award was unreasonable given the divided success
    of the parties and his offers to settle.  I disagree. An appellate court will
    only set aside a costs award if it is plainly wrong or there is an error in
    principle: <em>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</em>, 2004 1 S.C.R. 303 at
    para. 27. The motion judge considered the degree of success achieved by the
    parties and the offers to settle.  I see no basis on which to interfere. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal but vary the November 10, 2017 order
    as reflected in Schedule D attached hereto.  I would order the husband to pay
    the wife $13,500 in costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity scale inclusive
    of disbursements and applicable tax.</p>
