  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction
    entered by Justice Irving W. André of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with
    a jury, on October 4, 2016. </p>
  <p><span class=StyleBold>By the Court:</span></p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:100%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Facts and issues</span></h1>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The appellant was
    found guilty of second-degree murder by a jury. The events giving rise to the
    conviction occurred at and near a backyard house party.  The appellant was 19
    years old at the time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>It may be unclear
    whether the appellant and his friends were invited to the party by a guest.
    What is clear is that they did not know the host and were asked to leave. As
    they were leaving, one of the partygoers (the “instigator”) “sucker-punched” one
    of the appellant’s friends (the “initial victim”). When another of the
    appellant’s friends attempted to intervene, the instigator punched him as well.
    The intervening friend pushed the instigator to the ground and the appellant
    and his friends left the backyard. As they were making their way to the street,
    one member of the appellant’s group damaged a car mirror. A group of the partygoers,
    estimated at between 20 and 70 people, left the house party to confront the
    appellant’s group on the street. The confrontation resulted in violence. Among
    other things, the instigator struck the initial victim with a 2x2 tree stake.
    Soon after, the appellant produced a pocket knife and stabbed one of the
    partygoers (the “victim”), causing his death.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The appellant was
    arrested later the same day, spoke to a lawyer and was then interviewed by the
    police. The interview lasted several hours. During this police interview, the
    appellant admitted that he stabbed the victim. The appellant’s statement was
    ruled voluntary and was used to cross-examine him at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    appeals his conviction and submits that the trial judge erred: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(i) in finding that his statement to the police was voluntary;  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(ii) by refusing to charge the jury on the defence of others; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(iii) by giving an unbalanced review of the evidence in his
    instructions on self-defence; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(iv) by effectively taking away the defence of provocation from
    the jury.</p>

    appellant’s statement voluntary, the trial judge noted that the appellant
    provided an inculpatory statement hours after repeatedly asserting his right to
    silence. The trial judge concluded the appellant did so as the result of seeing
    a video of his girlfriend disclosing to the police inculpatory admissions he
    allegedly made to her following the stabbing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The trial judge held
    that the interviewing police officer had a right to continue questioning the
    appellant, despite the appellant’s assertions of his right to silence, so long
    as the officer did not offer the appellant a <span class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span
style='color:windowtext'>quid pro quo</span></span> and so long as the
    appellant’s will was not overborne by the officer such that an atmosphere of
    oppression resulted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The trial judge found
    there was no evidence that the interviewing officer or any other officer made
    any threats or offered any inducements to the appellant in exchange for a
    statement. The trial judge concluded that the appellant’s will was not
    overborne and that no<i> <span class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span style='color:windowtext'>quid
    pro quo</span></span></i> was offered; rather, “there was merely [the
    appellant’s] despair on seeing his girlfriend disclose what [the appellant]
    allegedly said to her concerning the fatal stabbing”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The trial judge
    also rejected a defence argument that attempts by the interviewing officer to
    undermine the legal advice given to the appellant and suggestions that the
    appellant might not get an opportunity to testify vitiated the voluntariness of
    the statement. In the trial judge’s view, the appellant made it clear during
    the interview why he decided to give a statement despite his earlier assertions
    of his right to silence. The appellant’s attitude changed dramatically after he
    saw his girlfriend’s statement. On seeing the video, he said, “I can’t believe
    she just did that.” He later told the interviewing officer, “[t]he minute you
    showed the video, I cracked.” Thus, in the trial judge’s view, there was no
    evidence of threats or inducements and the sole trigger for the appellant’s
    inculpatory statement was seeing his girlfriend’s incriminating video statement. </span></p>

    Crown submits that, in determining voluntariness, the trial judge applied the
    correct legal principles and properly considered the entire context of the
    interview. The interviewing officer’s statement, for example, that the
    appellant’s trial strategy might be that he would not testify, was a fair and
    accurate characterization of what could happen at trial. The Crown asserts that
    the trial judge’s factual finding that the appellant chose to speak as a result
    of being confronted, entirely properly, with the truth as conveyed to the
    police by his girlfriend, is entitled to deference.</span></p>

    confession is voluntary is a question of mixed fact and law. If the trial judge
    considered all the relevant circumstances, a finding of voluntariness is
    essentially a factual one that should only be interfered with if there is some
    palpable and overriding error which impacted the trial judge’s assessment of

    in <span class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span style='color:windowtext'>R. v. Wabason</span></span>,
    in our view, the trial judge “confine[d] too narrowly the notion of inducements

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Based on our
    review of the record, the interviewing officer’s statements to the appellant
    during the interview went well beyond saying the appellant might adopt a trial
    strategy of not testifying and crossed the line into undermining the legal
    advice the appellant had received to remain silent. In particular, at least one
    of the officer’s statements asserted more generally that the appellant may
    never get an opportunity to tell his side of the story. More significantly, the
    officer’s statements suggested the appellant would not be believed if he did
    not tell his side of the story to the police and further, that a trial court
    would see him, on video, refusing to comment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    interviewing officer made the following statements to the appellant prior to
    his inculpatory statement:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>19:07</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Officer: If your mom says, this is what you should do, your
    lawyer says this is what you should do, I say, this is what you should do. <u>You
    gotta take what everybody says and decide for yourself, right? You’re a 19 year

  <p class=CQuote>Officer: …<u>people will judge you on how you are in here</u>,

  <p class=CQuote>Officer: <u>So when that goes and gets played in court and you
    don’t get a-, say, you don’t get an opportunity to ever say your side of the

    the judge gets to watch…</u></p>
  <p class=CQuote>19:53</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Following an assertion by the appellant that he did not stab
    anyone and “had nothing to do with this.”]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Officer: <u>If you didn’t do any of that stuff, right? … Then
    you should feel free in telling me what you did last night</u>, where you were,
    who you were with.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Appellant: I’d rather not comment on all that though.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Officer: Well, there you go. <u>So then no one’s gonna believe you,

  <p class=CQuote>19:57 – 58</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Officer: So if you, <u>if you can tell me how you cut your

  <p class=CQuote>Appellant: I’ve been advised not to, sir.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>

    [1999] O.J. No. 3515 (S.C.), at paras. 160-68, police assertions to the effect
    that an accused’s credibility is at its highest during a police interview and
    that a trial court will see and take a negative view of a refusal to speak are
    legally incorrect and undermine the accused’s right to silence. </span></p>

    suggestion that, despite legal advice, the 19-year-old appellant should make
    his own decision about whether to speak and that he would not be believed if he
    did not speak during the police interview, improperly undermined the advice the
    appellant received from his lawyer.   </span></p>

    statement, the interviewing officer’s prior assertion that the trial court
    would see the appellant refusing to comment became an implicit <span
class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span style='color:windowtext'>quid pro quo</span></span> – the appellant would suffer negative legal consequences if he maintained his
    position that he had done nothing wrong and did not want to comment and he would
    be viewed in a better light by the judge and jury if he accepted
    responsibility. </span></p>

    circumstances, the trial judge should have considered whether the officer’s
    threats and inducements “standing alone or in combination with other factors, [were]
    strong enough to raise a reasonable doubt about whether the will of the subject
    [was] overborne”: <span class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span style='color:windowtext'>Wabason</span></span><i>,</i> at para. 19, citing <span class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span style='color:windowtext'>Oickle</span></span>,
    at para. 57. Further, the appellant’s age and the overall context of the
    interview are relevant considerations to this inquiry: <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    appellant was a 19-year-old young man at the time of his police interview and
    had little prior experience in dealing with the police. Before providing an
    inculpatory statement at 22:56 on October 18, 2014, he had been in a police
    interview room since 17:16 and the formal interview had begun four hours
    earlier, at 18:54. During the course of the interview, which continued with
    some interruptions while the interviewing officer obtained additional information
    including the fact of the appellant’s girlfriend’s statement to the police, the
    appellant said “no comment” in response to the officer’s questions on more than
    100 occasions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>In the context of
    this case, we agree that the appellant’s statements “no comment” did not
    require the police to cease questioning. Although the appellant repeatedly said
    “no comment”, he never asked to terminate the interview or to return to his
    cell. Part way through the interview, in addition to saying “no comment”, he
    also began to claim he had nothing to do with the incident. Considered in
    context, his assertions that he did not wish to comment were somewhat equivocal,
    as he seemed content to learn what information the police had, which the
    officer disclosed piecemeal as the interview continued.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    have said, in our view, various statements by the interviewing officer amounted
    to improper threats and inducements. Although we acknowledge that the immediate
    trigger for the appellant’s inculpatory statement may have been the appellant’s
    despair at seeing his girlfriend’s incriminating video statement, to render a
    statement involuntary, threats and inducements need not be the sole
    contributing factor: <span class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span style='color:windowtext'>Oickle</span></span>,
    at para 57. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    and inducements constituted an improper attempt to undermine the legal advice
    the appellant had received and amounted to an implicit <span
class=MsoSubtleEmphasis><span style='color:windowtext'>quid pro quo</span></span>.
    In all the circumstances, we are not satisfied that the Crown has satisfied its
    burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the interviewing officer’s
    threats and inducements did not have a coercive effect on the appellant and did
    not contribute to his will to remain silent being overborne. In our view, the
    Crown failed to prove that the appellant’s statement was voluntary beyond a
    reasonable doubt, accordingly it should have been excluded from the evidence at
    trial.</span></p>

    a basis for the defence to be left with the jury. Although aspects of the
    appellant’s cross-examination may have undermined the basis for that defence,
    it was for the jury to determine what aspects of the evidence they would rely
    on, not the trial judge. The fact that the trial judge referred to the assault
    on the initial victim as part of the context for his instructions on self-defence
    did not obviate the requirement to charge on defence of others. </span></p>

    the trial judge also failed to refer to evidence that supported the appellant’s

    trial judge invited the jury to examine a photograph of the appellant to
    observe whether they could see the facial bruises the appellant claimed to have
    suffered. The photograph was taken less than 24 hours after the incident. The
    trial judge did not draw the jury’s attention to the testimony of the police
    photographer who had agreed that bruises often do not show up immediately after
    an event, and added it was his preference to have individuals return a few days
    later for photographs (which was not done with the appellant). </span></p>

    trial judge instructed the jury “it is a matter of common sense that if
    repeatedly punched with moderate to great force, [the appellant] would have
    suffered visible facial injury.” Read in context, this statement telegraphed
    the trial judge’s view that the appellant’s evidence of being punched and
    suffering facial injuries was not credible. </span></p>

    to refer the jury to evidence pointing the other way, the trial judge may well have
    undermined the jury’s ability to evaluate the appellant’s evidence fairly. Nor
    did the trial judge remind the jury, in reviewing the photographic evidence, to
    keep in mind that the appellant is dark-skinned.</span></p>

    trial judge stated: “there is no specific evidence that the [victim] and/or his
    companions engaged in a wrongful act or insult that was sudden”. On our review
    of the record, there was evidence capable of supporting a finding of suddenness.
    Further, we read this instruction as the trial judge offering his view that
    suddenness could not be made out. In doing so, he usurped the function of the
