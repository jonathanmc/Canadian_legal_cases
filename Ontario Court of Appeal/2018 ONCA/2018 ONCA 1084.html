    2001, c. 27. One of the respondents, Mr. Albinowski, was also charged with the

    sworn November 13, 2014, and the respondents’ five-week joint trial was
    expected to conclude March 8, 2018. The total delay that the trial judge
    considered on the respondents’ s. 11(b) application was 39.75 months.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>The trial judge
    determined that almost a third of the delay arose from delay in scheduling the
    judicial pre-trial conferences and preliminary inquiry. He characterized most
    of this delay as institutional delay and held it was not justified by any
    exceptional circumstance or transitional exceptional circumstance under the
    framework set out in <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    follow, I would allow the appeal. In my view, the trial judge erred in his
    application of the <i>Jordan</i> framework. In particular, he mischaracterized
    the delays due to defence counsel unavailability as institutional delay.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:200%'>Basic <i>Jordan</i> </span>Analytical
    Framework</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:windowtext'> <span lang=EN-US>This case was in
    the system some 20 months before <em>Jordan</em> ushered in the new framework
    for s. 11(b) applications. As <em>Jordan</em> instructs, and as the trial judge
    acknowledged, the new framework applies to any case in the justice system when <em>Jordan</em> was released. This court must apply the <em>Jordan</em> framework to determine
    whether the application was wrongly decided, as the Crown alleges. It is therefore
    useful at the beginning of these reasons to set out a summary of the now
    well-known <em>Jordan</em> framework that governs the s. 11(b) analysis in this
    case. As this court compendiously stated in <em>R. v. Picard</em>, 2017 ONCA
    692, 137 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 26, leave to appeal refused, [2018] S.C.C.A.
    No. 135:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In brief, under <i>Jordan</i> a
    delay from the date of the charge to the actual or anticipated end of trial in
    Superior Court (minus defence delay) is presumptively unreasonable if it
    exceeds 30 months. To rebut this presumption, the Crown must establish
    “exceptional circumstances”. Exceptional circumstances generally fall into two
    categories: (1) discrete events, and (2) particular complexity arising from the
    evidence or the issues. The Crown may also rely on a “transitional exceptional circumstance”
    for cases that were already in the system pre-<em>Jordan</em>. A transitional
    exceptional circumstance will apply if the Crown can establish that the time
    the case has taken is justified based on the parties’ reasonable reliance on
    the law as it previously existed.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Trial Judge’s Reasons on the s. 11(b) Application</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>Applying the <em>Jordan</em> framework in this case, the trial judge began his analysis by noting that the delay
    from the swearing of the information to the anticipated end of the trial was
    39.75 months. He then turned to consider two specific periods of delay, which the
    Crown sought to characterize as defence-caused delay because they arose from
    the inability to coordinate the schedules of three defence counsel: (a) the
    2.75-month delay in scheduling three judicial pre-trials prior to the
    preliminary inquiry; and (b) the approximate 8-month delay in scheduling the
    three-week preliminary inquiry.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    the defence from the first date the Crown and court are ready to proceed, but
    the defence is not. In the alternative, the Crown submits that the <em>Godin</em> principles, which arose in the particular circumstances of that case, do not

    the earlier date.&nbsp;Indeed, his prior conduct in seeking earlier dates for
    the preliminary inquiry — efforts which were ignored —&nbsp;suggests that he
    wished to proceed expeditiously. I respectfully agree with Glithero R.S.J.,
    dissenting in the Court of Appeal, at para. 53, that:&nbsp;“<u>To hold that the

    recall the circumstances under which Cromwell J. for the Supreme Court made these
    statements. The determination in <em>Godin</em>,<i> </i>that defence counsel

    available on the earliest date offered for the rescheduled preliminary inquiry,

    of the judicial pre-trials and the preliminary inquiry.  The reason for their
    unavailability was clear: they were engaged with previously scheduled
    professional commitments. Their unavailability was not related to “defence
    actions legitimately taken to respond to the charges”, such as “preparation
    time” and “defence applications and requests that are not frivolous”: <em>Jordan</em>,
    at para. 65. Thus, as <em>Jordan</em> further directs, at para. 64, their
    unavailability, when the Crown and court were available, fell squarely within
    the category of delay that counts against the defence:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>As another example, the defence

    unavailability on any of the dates offered in a five-month period:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>Furthermore,
    the situation in&nbsp;</span><em>Godin</em><span style='background:white'>&nbsp;is
    not comparable to what occurred in this case and does not stand for the

    delay to the defence as soon as a single available date is offered to defence
    counsel and not accepted. The court noted that s. 11(<span class=ssit>b</span>)
    requires reasonable availability and cooperation, but does not require defence
    counsel to “hold themselves in a state of perpetual availability.” In the
    present case, the delay in question did not arise from Crown unavailability on

    which sets out an analytical framework for the assessment of delay in joint
    trials with multiple accused. <em>Gopie</em> instructs that “an individualized
    approach must be taken to the attribution of defence-caused delay in cases of
    jointly-charged accused”: <em>Gopie</em>, at para. 128. This approach avoids “</span><span

    individualized approach in <em>Gopie</em> does not apply in this case because
    the delay was common to all respondents who proceeded as a collective in this
    joint trial. Here, the actions or inactions of a co-accused did not cause the
    delay. Rather, the delay at issue was entirely due to scheduling challenges,
    which arose directly and inevitably from the respondents’ joint situation.</span></p>

    ground that joint proceedings were justified in this case (especially in light
    of the coordinated nature of the allegations), all parties accepted that
    severance was never an option. As Mr. Albinowski’s counsel submitted before the
    trial judge on the s. 11(b) application, a severance application would have
    amounted to the kind of defence conduct decried under the <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>framework.
    In essence, the defence presented a united front. For example, during the s.
    11(b) application, counsel for Mr. Pipien commenced his submissions by stating
    he was speaking on behalf of the two other defence counsel. Moreover, each
    defence counsel largely endorsed the others’ submissions on the application.
    Because the defence proceeded through the system as a collective, the delay
    caused by scheduling challenges must be analyzed in the same manner – that is, communally.  </span></p>

    “hostage” by his co-accused’s counsel’s unavailability: <em>Gopie</em>, at

    to 15 months before conducting a preliminary inquiry, they could not be
    expected to have dates available earlier, as they needed time to prepare for or
    conduct the hearing should earlier dates become available. The trial judge
    described the commitments counsel had made as being consistent with the court’s
    expectation of the interlude between readiness for the preliminary hearing and the
    hearing, and that the dates ultimately set for the hearing accorded with the
    court’s practice at the time: at para. 26. On this basis, the trial judge
    refused to characterize this period as defence delay.</span></p>

    noted, these dates were offered three months in advance. Second, three judicial
    pre-trials had already been conducted, presumably fleshing out the issues to be
    addressed at the preliminary inquiry. Third, the witness list had already been
    settled. The Crown planned to call five necessary witnesses plus ten witnesses
    at the request of the defence. Expecting defence counsel to be available in
    these circumstances does not amount to insisting that they “hold themselves in
    a state of perpetual availability”, particularly in the post-<em>Jordan</em><i> </i>era. Here, the plain fact is, as stated in <em>Jordan</em>, “the court and
    the Crown [were] ready to proceed, but the defence [was] not”: <em>Jordan</em>,
    at para. 64.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>In my view, the trial
    judge’s analysis ignores </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>’s call for “[a] change of direction” and
    the need to break the “culture of complacency towards delay [that] has emerged
    in the criminal justice system”: </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>, at paras. 5, 40. </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> imposes
    an obligation on all actors in the criminal justice system, including defence
    counsel, to alleviate the delays that have plagued the criminal justice system.
    As I have already noted, </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> holds that “the defence will have directly
    caused the delay if the court and the Crown are ready to proceed, but the
    defence is not”: </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>, at para. 64. That is precisely what happened
    in this case. Post-</span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>, counsel – both the Crown and defence – are
    not entitled to rely on the way things have always been done. </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> demands
    change. While the dates may have been unexpected, the fact is that the court
    was able to offer dates allowing a reasonable time for the defence to prepare
    for and conduct the preliminary inquiry in this case. The Crown was ready to
    proceed on those dates but not all three defence counsel were – at least at the
    same time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>I can certainly
    understand why, in the circumstances of this case, it might have been difficult
    for three busy defence counsel to coordinate their schedules in order to conduct
    a multiple-week preliminary inquiry in three months’ time. The preliminary inquiry
    was scheduled before </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> was decided and everyone was working under
    the framework and state of affairs that existed pre-</span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>.
    However, the respondents cannot insist on the strict application of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> ceiling, and at the same time, excuse the delay they caused because they were relying
    on pre-</span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-US
style='color:windowtext'> conditions. </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> holds, at para. 96, that the “transitional
    exceptional circumstance [exception] will apply when the Crown satisfies the
    court that the time the case has taken is justified based on the parties’
    reasonable reliance on the law as it previously existed.” If the delay
    occasioned by defence counsel’s refusal of earlier available dates for the
    judicial pre-trials and preliminary inquiry does not constitute defence delay
    because they relied on pre-</span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> scheduling practices, then the
    transitional exceptional circumstance should apply.  </span></p>

    under the 30-month presumptive ceiling, the defence bears the onus of
    demonstrating that the delay is unreasonable. To do so, the defence must show
    that it took meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite
    the proceedings, and the case took markedly longer than it reasonably should
    have. Absent both these factors, the s. 11(b) application must fail. Stays
    beneath the presumptive ceiling should be granted only in clear cases. See: </span><em><span

    paras. 82-83.  </span></p>

    it is therefore unreasonable. While there were no defence delay tactics, the
    evidence does not reveal any meaningful steps that the respondents took to
    expedite the proceedings, nor that the case took markedly longer than it
    reasonably should have. The respondents appeared content with the pace of the
    joint proceedings.</span></p>

    counsel’s efforts to expedite the proceedings were in keeping with the guidance
    provided by <i>Jordan</i> as to the kind of reasonable steps that are expected
    from the Crown to attempt to avoid delay. While not an exhaustive list, these “might
    include prompt resort to case management processes to seek the assistance of
    the court, or seeking assistance from the defence to streamline evidence or
    issues for trial or to coordinate pre-trial applications, or resorting to any
    other appropriate procedural means”: </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'>, at para. 70. Certainly, Crown counsel’s
    endeavours in this case of proposing a paper preliminary inquiry, offering to
    fragment the trial, and seeking various admissions fell well within the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> description of reasonableness. And, as </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-US style='color:windowtext'> directs, at para. 70, “[t]he Crown, we
    emphasize, is not required to show that the steps it took were ultimately
