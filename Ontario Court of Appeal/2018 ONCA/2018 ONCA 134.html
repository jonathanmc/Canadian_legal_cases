  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentence imposed on April 12, 2017 by
    Justice Robert L. Maranger of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Brown J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, a former RCMP officer, was convicted of numerous offences
    involving horrendous abuse he inflicted on his 11-year old son. Specifically,
    the appellant was found guilty of two counts of aggravated assault, one count
    of assault with a weapon, one count of sexual assault causing bodily harm, one
    count of unlawful confinement, and one count of failing to provide the
    necessaries of life. In addition, the appellant was convicted of two counts
    relating to the improper storage of ammunition and a firearm.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed a global sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment,
    less 22 months credit for pre-sentence custody. The appellant seeks leave to
    appeal his sentence and, if leave is granted, he seeks a reduction of five to
    ten years in his term of imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant advances three grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h1>FIRST GROUND </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant submits the trial judge erred in stating the
    appropriate range of sentence was 12 to 20 years. The appellant points to other
    cases involving the serious abuse of children in which the sentences imposed
    ranged from two to 16 years. He also argued that two cases the trial judge
    referred to which involved sentences of 18.5 and 25 years were factually
    distinguishable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no merit in this ground of appeal. The trial judge correctly noted
    that the range of penalty for cases of extreme child abuse varies widely. He
    reviewed the salient cases placed before him by the Crown and the appellant. He
    observed that the conviction on the count of sexual assault causing bodily harm
    carried with it a mandatory minimum penalty of five years. The trial judge
    found that “the level of child abuse here was at the furthest end of the spectrum.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That finding was fully supported by the evidence. The appellant engaged
    in a horrific course of abusing his son over a six-month period, the details of
    which are set out in the trial judge’s reasons for conviction: 2016 ONSC 7249. I
    see no reason to repeat the incomprehensibly cruel acts visited upon the young
    victim by his father, the extreme pain he must have endured, and the terror he
    must have experienced. As the trial judge commented at the end of his reasons
    for judgment: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>This was a very difficult trial. That a parent could do the
    things that were done to AJ D. was gut-wrenching. That being said, however, the
    fact that this half-starved, burned and battered 11 year old could somehow
    summon up the strength to escape his cruel captivity and later seemingly rise
    above it, is a testament to the indomitability of the human spirit. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no error in the trial judge’s conclusion that the abuse fell “at
    the furthest end of the spectrum” and his resulting use of a 12 to 20-year
    range of sentence.</p>
  <h1>SECOND GROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As his second ground of appeal, the appellant argues the trial judge
    failed to give adequate weight to the psychiatric and psychological evidence of
    his mental health at the time of the offences as a mitigating factor and
    over-emphasized denunciation and deterrence. The trial judge considered, but
    ultimately did not accept, the appellant’s sentencing submission that there was
    a causal link between his mental health and the commission of the offence,
    which should operate as a factor reducing the length of his sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the trial, the appellant had advanced the position that he was not
    criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder. The trial judge did not
    accept the evidence of the appellant’s expert clinical psychologist, Karim Jbeili. 
    He found that Mr. Jbeili was not impartial, had no prior experience in
    providing forensic psychological evidence, had failed to examine in a
    meaningful way all of the evidence necessary to formulate a valid independent
    opinion – including failing to review all of the videos taken by the appellant
    of him torturing his son in the basement – and vacillated in the opinion he
    gave. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge accepted that the appellant may have suffered from depression
    and post-traumatic stress disorder, he rejected the notion that a mental
    disorder had caused him to be in a state of dissociation to the extent the
    appellant was incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of his acts
    and/or knew that they were wrong when he committed the crimes against his son.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    expert psychiatrists testified at the sentencing hearing. Dr. Helen Ward opined
    that during the period of the offence, the appellant was suffering from
    post-traumatic stress disorder and a depressive episode, but he was not
    delusional. Despite his mental condition at the time of the offences, Dr. Ward
    testified that the appellant was aware of the physical nature and quality of
    his acts. As well, the appellant’s PTSD would not have affected him, through
    cognitive distortions and re-experiencing of trauma, to the point where he
    would have been unable to know that the acts in question were morally or
    legally wrong. However, Dr. Ward opined that the appellant’s PTSD and
    depression contributed substantially to the commission of the offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Bradley Booth stated the appellant likely had significant depression, anxiety
    and PTSD, but concluded that the appellant somewhat over-reported his
    difficulties. Both the PTSD and the depression were described as being of mild
    to moderate severity around the time of the offences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his sentencing reasons, the trial judge considered the psychiatric evidence. He
    concluded Dr. Booth’s testimony, that the PTSD at the time of the offences was
    of mild to moderate severity, seemed to correspond to the evidence heard at
    trial, especially the evidence about how the appellant acted on the three
    videos that showed him torturing his son in the basement. The trial judge
    stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The offender in that video, far more reflects someone with an
    obsessive-compulsive narcissistic personality disorder than someone suffering
    from post-traumatic stress disorder. [The videos] depict a calm, cool, cruel
    interrogator certainly unafraid of [his son] and seemingly obsessed with his
    own sense of right and wrong.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the evidence, the trial judge expressed the view that the appellant’s
    mental health provided some explanation for his behaviour, but was not the
    cause of it. As a result, he was not inclined to make rehabilitation the focus
    of crafting the appellant’s sentence instead of denunciation and deterrence: <em>R.
    v. Shahnawaz</em> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 29 (C.A.), at paras. 30 to 32; <em>R. v.
    Prioriello</em>, 2012 ONCA 63, at para. 11.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits the trial judge failed to properly consider the psychiatric
    evidence when he failed to conclude a causal link existed between the
    appellant’s mental health and the commission of the offences. I do not accept
    this submission. In his sentencing reasons, the trial judge reviewed the
    psychiatric evidence at some length. The appellant has not pointed to any
    misapprehension of that evidence by the trial judge. The trial judge assessed
    and weighed the expert evidence together with the other evidence, including the
    videos taken by the appellant in the basement, as he was permitted to do. I see
    no error in his factual analysis concerning the role played by the appellant’s
    mental health in his commission of the offences. Nor would I interfere with his
    conclusion that denunciation and deterrence were the primary considerations in
    his sentencing. Accordingly, I would give no effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h1>THIRD GROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant contends the trial judge erred in his consideration of
    aggravating and mitigating factors. I see no merit in this submission. The
    trial judge’s finding that the appellant’s conduct amounted to a breach of the
    highest position of trust was unimpeachable. As to the appellant’s submission
    that the trial judge should have given greater weight to some mitigating
    factors, the trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s mental health was
    the single most important issue for consideration as a mitigating factor was
    reasonable in the circumstances. As for his submission that the trial judge
    failed to take into account other mitigating factors, I do not accept these submissions.
    For instance, the suggestion that the child made a “quick physical recovery”
    does not accord with the medical records and the damage done to the child’s
    body. Moreover, given the months of punishing psychological and physical abuse
    endured by this child in the basement of his family home, the suggestion that
