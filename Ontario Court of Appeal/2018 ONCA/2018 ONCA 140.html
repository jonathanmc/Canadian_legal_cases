  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board, dated September 14, 2016, with reasons reported at [2016] O.R.B.D. No.
    2393. </p>
  <p class=Judge>Fairburn J.A.:                     </p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was found not criminally
    responsible (NCR) in 2004. She spent her first ten years as an NCR accused in
    the Brockville Mental Health Centre. The Ontario Review Board then ordered that
    she be transferred to the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (the Royal) and
    detained within their “Secure Forensic Unit”. She started abusing substances,
    ingesting alcohol, cocaine, and amphetamines, about six months after being
    placed in one of the Royal’s two secure units. In an effort to control her
    behaviour, the Royal removed some of her privileges and eventually moved her from
    one secure forensic unit to a more secure forensic unit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although s. 672.56(2) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>requires
    that the Board be notified of significant increases in restrictions on liberty
    that remain in force for a period exceeding seven days, it was about two months
    before the Royal notified the Board of the appellant’s transfer between secure units.
    At the restriction of liberty hearing that followed under s. 672.81(2.1), the appellant
    argued that the delay in notification resulted in a s. 7 <em>Charter </em>breach
    and a s. 24(1) remedy was due.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board divided on whether notice was required,
    with the majority concluding that it was not. Having come to this conclusion,
    it was unnecessary for the majority to consider the appellant’s <em>Charter </em>arguments.
    The Board went on to unanimously conclude that, regardless of whether notice
    was required or not, the Royal’s decision to transfer the appellant between
    units was the least onerous and least restrictive measure available in the
    circumstances.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant raises four grounds of appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The primary ground focuses on whether the Royal
    should have notified the Board about the change in the appellant’s liberty
    status in accordance with s. 672.56(2) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>672.56(2) A person who increases the restrictions on
    the liberty of the accused significantly pursuant to authority delegated to the
    person by a Review Board shall … </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(b) give notice of the increase as soon as is
    practicable to the accused and, if the increased restrictions remain in force
    for a period exceeding seven days, to the Review Board.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties maintain that there is significant ambiguity
    over how to apply s. 672.56(2) and, in particular, how to identify restrictions
    on liberty rising to the level of requiring notice to the Board. They ask for
    guidance on this point. As will be explained, although there are some types of increases
    in restrictions on liberty that will almost invariably result in the
    requirement for notice to the Board, the question of notice must be approached
    on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the NCR accused’s liberty status both
    before and following the restrictions imposed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Applying the analytical framework explained
    below, I conclude that there was no need for notice in this case. As the second
    and third grounds of appeal pertain to <em>Charter </em>issues arising from the
    alleged failure to notify, there is no need to address them. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The final ground of appeal concerns the Board’s
    conclusion that transferring the appellant between units constituted the least onerous
    and least restrictive measure available in the circumstances. I see no error in
    the Board’s approach to this issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What follows is a brief overview of the factual
    backdrop for this appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant has a long history with mental
    illness. She has been under the jurisdiction of the Board since June 2, 2004
    when she was found NCR at the age of twenty. A 2015 report to the Board suggests
    that she has a history of “decompensations involving persecutory and grandiose
    delusions, hypersexuality, disorganized thought process, rapid mood
    fluctuations, disorganized speech, impulsive and dangerous behaviours,
    pressured speech, and flight of ideas”. She is currently diagnosed with
    schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type in remission, substance abuse disorders,
    and antisocial and histrionic personality disorders. She has demonstrated a
    lack of remorse and what one of her psychiatrists refers to as impulsivity,
    aggressiveness and a disregard for the safety of others.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In December 2014, the Board concluded that the
    appellant had met a therapeutic impasse at the Brockville Mental Health Centre.
    The Board ordered that she be transferred to the Royal and detained within their
    “Secure Forensic Unit”. The Board’s disposition included privileges up to and
    including residing in the community in an accommodation approved by the person
    in charge of the hospital. The appellant was also ordered to abstain absolutely
    from the non-medical use of drugs and alcohol.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Royal has two secure forensic units: the
    secure forensic rehabilitation unit (FRU) and the secure forensic assessment
    unit (FAU). There is no dispute that the FAU is the more secure of the two secure
    units. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was transferred to the Royal in
    January 2015. She was originally placed in the FRU. Starting in May, her
    clinical team detected a pattern of alcohol and drug consumption. The appellant
    appeared to be obtaining alcohol and drugs while on passes to the hospital
    grounds. Although the record reveals little clarity around what privileges the
    appellant had been extended while on the FRU, it is clear that the Royal removed
    some privileges to control her consumption of illicit substances. While the
    privileges were removed and reinstated a few times, the appellant continued to
    access drugs and alcohol, even when completely confined to the FRU. In late
    August 2015, in an effort to control her consumption of drugs and alcohol, she
    was transferred to the FAU. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>NOTICE TO THE BOARD AND THE RESTRICTION OF LIBERTY HEARING</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s counsel wrote to the Royal about
    six weeks following her move to the FAU. He suggested that there had been a “restriction
    of liberty” requiring the hospital to notify the Board. Eight days later, on
    October 21, 2015, the Royal sent a letter to the Board notifying it that a “restriction
    of the liberty of the accused [had] been increased significantly for a period
    exceeding seven days”. The Royal maintains that it provided this notice
    strictly as a precautionary measure, and denies that notice was statutorily
    required. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board responded by scheduling a restriction
    of liberty hearing at the same time as the appellant’s pending annual review. The
    restriction of liberty hearing was later adjourned. Despite the appellant being
    transferred back to the FRU in January 2016, the restriction of liberty hearing
    eventually went ahead, commencing in May 2016. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION UNDER APPEAL </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In accordance with the manner in which the legal
    issue was argued before the Board, its reasons for decision largely focus on
    whether the transfer from the FRU to the FAU triggered the notice requirement under
    s. 672.56(2). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In concluding that there was no need for notice,
    the majority emphasized that the decision to transfer was a treatment one,
    arising from an effort to control the appellant’s consumption of illicit substances
    that posed a risk to her mental health. Although the majority acknowledged that
    there were differences in the “security arrangements” between the FRU and the
    FAU, differences that I will review later, it highlighted that they were both
    secure units. As the appellant was at the point where she needed one-on-one supervision
    on the FRU, the majority concluded that moving her to the FAU actually resulted
    in a less restrictive environment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The minority judgment narrowed in on the
    question of notice, specifically rejecting “treatment” as a justification for
    not giving s. 672.56(2) notice. The minority concluded that notice of the
    appellant’s transfer to the FAU should have been given to the Board and that the
    failure to do so in accordance with s. 672.56(2) resulted in a s. 7 <em>Charter </em>breach. Although the minority was sensitive to the fact that individuals
    have different levels of privileges available to them on the FRU, it concluded
    that a transfer to the FAU meant a total loss of privileges. While the minority
    did not order a specific remedy, it noted: “It would be of assistance to the
    accused, the ORB and ultimately the hospital if a policy was put into place
    which identified any changes to privilege levels which had the potential to
    exceed 7 days and which was also potentially a significant restriction on the
    liberty of the accused.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite its division on notice, the Board was
    unanimous that the appellant’s move to the FAU was necessary and appropriate in
    the circumstances. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES AND ANALYSIS </span></h1>
  <h6><span lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I will deal with the issues in the following
    order. I will first consider preliminary matters related to whether the appeal is
    moot and the standard of review. I will then discuss the analytical approach to
    identifying a significant increase in restrictions on liberty, such that notice
    under s. 672.56(2) is required. This approach draws heavily on the broader
    statutory and common law context in which the notice provision exists. I will
    then apply this analytical approach to the factual circumstances of this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, I will consider the appellant’s submission
    that the Board erred by concluding that the approach taken by the Royal
    constituted the least onerous and least restrictive measure available in the
    circumstances.  </span></p>
  <h6><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Mootness </span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was transferred back to the FRU in
    January 2016, long before the restriction of liberty hearing was held. There is
    therefore no “live controversy” between the parties and the appeal is moot: <em>Borowski
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342,<em> </em>at p. 353. Although
    the issue on appeal has been moot for some time, the Royal and the Attorney
    General do not oppose this court exercising its discretion in favour of
    deciding the matter. It is an appropriate case in which to do so for three reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appeal raises an important question
    about when the Board must be notified of a change in the liberty status of an
    NCR accused. The answer to this question is important to various groups,
    including NCR accused, hospitals entrusted with their care, and the Board. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-US>Second, bearing in mind the fluidity with
    which decisions that result in the granting and restricting of liberty
    interests take place, it can be difficult to have appeals from restriction of
    liberty hearings resolved while the impugned restrictions remain in effect.

    liberty. Accordingly, the appellant maintains that any decision that has a
    “meaningful” or “not insignificant impact” on the liberty of an NCR accused requires

    of Liberty” and reported to the Board. Only two situations are included in this
    category: (1) a transfer from a general level of security to a secure level for
    a period lasting longer than 7 days; and (2) withdrawal of permission to live
    in the community for a period lasting longer than seven days. Mr. Duffy

class=Underline>not</span> be considered a Restriction of Liberty, but will be
    reported to the ORB for their information only” (emphasis in original). This
    category involves three situations: (1) where the patient has been secluded for
    a period exceeding 7 days; (2) where the patient has been living in the
    community, but voluntarily agrees to an inpatient admission; and (3) where the
    patient is living in the community on a conditional discharge, but is
    involuntarily admitted to the hospital under the <em>Mental Health Act</em>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The categorical approach set out in the Guidelines
    conflicts with some of the Board’s prior jurisprudence. For instance, the Guidelines
    suggest that there is no “restriction of liberty” where an NCR accused is secluded
    for more than seven days (conflicting with <em>Ince</em>,<em> Jardine</em>,<em> Hazzard</em>, and<em> Huang</em>). The Guidelines also suggest that there is no
    “restriction of liberty” where an NCR accused loses his or her community
    privileges (conflicting with <em>Ly </em>and<em> Kelly</em>). </span></p>

    a responsible desire to achieve some consensus about when notice to the Board is
    required under s. 672.56(2), this type of categorical approach risks both
    undershooting and overshooting the statutory mark. For instance, one can
    imagine situations where a significant reduction in “hospital or town privileges”
    may result in a significant increase in restrictions on liberty. An NCR accused
    who has been permitted to return to stay at her family home for 72 hours every
    weekend for a lengthy period of time may well experience a significant increase
    in restrictions on her liberty if this privilege is revoked. Yet the Forensic
    Directors’ Guidelines suggest that this type of restriction will not be
    reported. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By way of another example, an NCR patient who is
    detained on a general unit, but is confined to her room and subject to one-on-one
    security in that unit, may experience a significant restoration of liberty if
    she were moved to a more secure unit, but become free of minute-to-minute
    oversight. Yet, the Forensic Directors’ Guidelines require notice based on the
    mere fact of a transfer from a general to secure unit, despite the restoration
    of liberty that might result. Indeed, the fact that a secure hospital setting
    may sometimes serve to increase an NCR accused’s liberty interests was
    commented upon in <em>Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre v. Ontario (Attorney
    General)</em>, 2004 SCC 20, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 498<em>, </em>at para. 34 (“<em>Tulikorpi</em>”):
    a “severely restricted NCR accused… might find more programs and amenities

    hospital where he might be ‘restricted to the ward he is placed in’.”</span></p>

    is unique, with complex individual needs that must be accommodated in the

    restrictions on liberty will act as likely predictors of the need for notice, an
    individualized assessment is called for in each case. </span></p>

    authority delegated to the person by a Review Board shall …” give notice to the
    Board “if the <em>increased restrictions </em>remain in force for a period
    exceeding seven days” (emphasis added). The Board’s jurisprudence reveals that
    the words “significantly” and “increases” are often left unmentioned when considering
    s. 672.56(2). For instance, the decisions often speak in terms of a
    “significant restriction of liberty” or a “restriction of liberty”.<a

    restriction on liberty that triggers the need for notice. While perhaps
    awkwardly phrased, s. 672.56(2) directs its attention to <em>significant
    increases</em> in restrictions on liberty. As the Attorney General points out,
    the word “significantly” acts as an adverb, modifying the verb “increases”. The
    object to which the modified verb relates is “restrictions on the liberty of

    focus the s. 672.56(2) notice provision on the escalation of restrictions on
    liberty relative to what they were before the hospital decision was made. When
    s. 672.56(2) is afforded its proper grammatical and ordinary meaning, the
    provision focuses on two points in time: (1) the NCR accused’s liberty status
    before the increase in restrictions; and (2) the NCR accused’s liberty status
    after the increase in restrictions. </span></p>

    settings where NCR patients often reside. As noted in <em>Tulikorpi</em>,<em> </em>at

    constrained by the same legal considerations that bind the Board in arriving at
    an appropriate disposition. Like the Board, keeping in mind the paramount concern
    for public safety, the hospital must make decisions that provide an NCR accused
    with the utmost liberty compatible with his or her situation. The hospital must
    remain vigilant about interfering with liberty interests as little as possible,
    making decisions that are the least onerous and least restrictive to the NCR
    accused’s liberty: <em>M.L.C.</em>, at paras. 28, 43-45; and <em>Chaudry (Re)</em>,
    2015 ONCA 317, 125 O.R. (3d) 641,<em> </em>at para. 72. This requirement acts
    as yet another important liberty safeguard for the NCR accused. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are other safeguards too. For instance, s.
    672.81(2) allows the hospital to ask for a hearing to review a disposition
    under s. 672.54(b) or (c). A hearing is mandatory in these circumstances.
    Section 672.82(1) also allows the Board to hold a hearing to review any of its
    dispositions at any time on its own motion or pursuant to the request of the
    NCR accused or any other party. Although an NCR accused who asks for a hearing
    under s. 672.82(1) is deemed to abandon any appeal he or she may have
    outstanding under s. 672.72, there is nothing to prevent the NCR accused who
    feels aggrieved by a hospital decision from at least bringing it to the Board’s
    attention and seeking redress: <em>R. v. Petroniuk</em>, 2014 ONSC 6951, at

    the Part XX.1 statutory scheme and interpreted by the common law, combine to
    provide a robust system of protection for an NCR accused’s liberty. It is
    against the backdrop of all of these protections that s. 672.56(2) notice must
    be understood.</span></p>

    the notice bar too high risks sacrificing the liberty interests of a
    particularly vulnerable group of people, ones who have committed criminal acts,
    but who bear no criminal responsibility for those acts – people who are as
    entitled to as much liberty as the next person, but for the safety risk they
    present to the public. </span></p>

    will not only result in unnecessary mandatory hearings under s. 672.81(2.1),
    but could interfere with the fundamental work of institutions that administer
    care to NCR patients. Section 672.56(2) is not intended to transform the Board
    into a body that second-guesses all or even most hospital decisions that
    adversely impact liberty. After all, the expert Board delegates to expert hospitals
    the power to adjust liberty up and down as called for. This delegation is done
    with confidence that the hospital, which is entrusted with the NCR accused’s
    care between annual reviews, will act professionally, ethically, and in
    accordance with the guiding legal authorities. Hospitals must be left to do their
    work free from constant review and all of the demands that a
    decision-notice-review-decision-notice-review approach would impose. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Considering these constraints and the contextual
    framework within which s. 672.56(2) notice operates, the word “significantly”
    must be granted its proper due. As previously reviewed, the NCR accused’s
    liberty is attended to in a multitude of ways. Considered in its proper
    context, then, the purpose of s. 672.56(2) is to act as a final liberty
    safeguard, allowing for a second-look at those hospital decisions that have such
    serious ramifications for the liberty of the NCR accused, that they should be
    examined ahead of the next yearly review. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This approach requires that the hospital
    consider the NCR accused’s liberty status both before and after decisions that
    result in increased restrictions on liberty. At the first stage, the NCR
    accused’s liberty norm must be identified. Calibrating the liberty norm
    requires consideration of the duration and pattern of liberty the NCR accused
    was experiencing before the decision or decisions resulting in increased restrictions
    on liberty. Determining the liberty norm does not ask what the individual may
    have been entitled to, but what he or she was actually experiencing before the
    increased restrictions were put in place. The liberty must be of sufficient
    duration to have become, objectively speaking, the NCR accused’s norm. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The pre-existing liberty norm cannot always be
    determined by looking to the very moment before a decision is made that results
    in increases in restrictions on liberty. Decision by decision, an NCR accused’s
    liberty interests may be whittled away over a period of time. While any one
    decision may not result in a significant increase in restrictions on liberty,
    all of the decisions combined may have this effect. Accordingly, when
    determining the NCR accused’s liberty norm, hospitals should take a contextual
    approach, one that considers the individual’s pattern of liberty in the recent
    past.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once the liberty norm is determined, it must be
    compared against the NCR accused’s liberty status following the increases in
    restrictions. Only where the change in liberty status clearly deviates from the
    NCR accused’s liberty norm must the hospital notify the Board. The change in
    liberty status must be so significant that a reasonable person, considering all
    of the circumstances, would think that the Board should be called on to consider
    whether the hospital properly applied the least onerous and least restrictive
    test ahead of the next annual review. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As with all tests, over time, jurisprudence will
    breathe life into this analysis. Certain circumstances will emerge which, by
    their very nature, will suggest a significant enough increase in restrictions
    on liberty that they will point toward the probable need for notice. For
    instance, if an NCR accused has been living in the community or afforded
    significant community access for long enough that it has become the
    individual’s liberty norm, then removal of these privileges for more than seven
    days will almost invariably result in the need for notice. Equally, where an
    NCR accused residing in a general unit and accessing multiple privileges is placed
    in a secure unit or in isolation for more than seven days, this will almost
    always trigger the need for notice. These are only examples. While Board
    decisions and appeals can drive the application of the test, an individualized
    assessment is still required in each case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, I agree with the appellant that, when the
    hospital is in doubt, notice should be given. Indeed, based on the Forensic
    Directors’ Guidelines, it appears that hospitals are already providing notice,
    even where they conclude that they are under no obligation to do so. This kind
    of responsible notice is encouraged. While notice under s. 672.56(2) will generate
    an automatic review under s. 672.81(2.1), it is always open to the hospital to
    simply inform the Board about a decision that has changed the NCR accused’s
    liberty status. This kind of notification would be by way of information only
    and not constitute official notice under s. 672.56(2), thereby avoiding an
    automatic hearing. Having received such information, if the Board deems it
    appropriate to hold a hearing, the Board has discretion to do so under s.
    672.82(1) and (1.1): <em>Petroniuk</em>,<em> </em>at para. 26. </span></p>

    decisions about patient needs and threats. If the patient’s situation permits,
    it is possible to have a cell phone, internet access, unsupervised visits with
    guests and family, and food ordered in each night. Visitors may come and go in
    accordance with permission granted. Those living on the FRU may also be granted
    off-unit privileges, including to the hospital grounds and, where appropriate,
    the community for short times.  However, medical staff may restrict the
    patient’s privileges on the FRU to essentially nothing.</span></p>

    obtain unsupervised internet access. Visits are supervised. Patients are not permitted
    onto the general hospital grounds or into the community, but have a yard with a
    wall around it dedicated to their use. Although a “healthy canteen” comes into

    privileges”. The appellant continually violated the Board’s requirement that
    she refrain from the consumption of illicit drugs and alcohol. </span></p>

    ingestion, the Royal would restrict the appellant’s privileges in an effort to
    modify her behaviour and avoid further decompensation of her mental status. The
    appellant entered into a cycle of having her privileges revoked and returned. Despite
    the Royal’s efforts, the appellant continued to have alcohol and drugs in her
    system throughout the summer of 2015. In July, she was found intoxicated after
    an excursion to the hospital grounds. In early August, her urine tested
    positive for amphetamines. On one occasion she managed to obtain alcohol while
    confined to the FRU. </span></p>

    exactly what privileges the appellant had during her time in the FRU, it is
    clear that she at least had some access to the general hospital grounds and may
    have been permitted to enter the community to visit with her mother and/or a
    friend. It is unclear whether she was permitted an overnight visit with her
    mother. In one part of the Royal’s December 2015 report to the Board, there is
    reference to the fact that the appellant had “successful overnight passes to
    her mother’s house without issue”. Elsewhere, the same report refers to the
    fact that the appellant had not spent more than 22 days outside of the hospital

    privileges on the FRU had already been removed. In Dr. Ward’s opinion, the
    appellant’s cravings for drugs and alcohol were so strong that the only way to
    have kept her on the FRU would have been to detain her in her room with
    one-on-one security. According to Dr. Ward, this would have restricted the
    appellant from “pretty much everything she had”, and may have been more
    restrictive of her liberty than detaining her in the FAU. </span></p>

    that “treatment” can result in a significant increase in restrictions on

    it was the transfer from the FRU to the FAU that caused the significant
    increase in restrictions on liberty. Before this court, the appellant expanded
    her argument to include the removal of privileges ahead of her transfer between
    units. While I accept that in determining the appellant’s liberty norm, the
    removal of privileges in the time-period proximate to the transfer can be taken
    into account, the record does not reveal with any precision what privileges she

    experiencing a significantly enhanced form of liberty while there. </span></p>

    she was living on the FRU. Mr. Duffy had not read the appellant’s chart. He
    could only testify that he believed that she had hospital, grounds, and
    community access. Dr. Watts confirmed that she was obtaining illicit substances
    while on the hospital grounds. He could not recall “exactly what frequency she
    was able to go off the ward”, but testified to the typical situation. He
    explained that although the appellant had off-ward privileges at some points:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]t changed depending on each relapse. Dr. Ward would restrict

    extended to the appellant before her transfer to the FAU and, therefore, it remains
    unclear what her liberty norm was prior to being confined on the FRU and then

    the FAU was necessary because her consumption of intoxicants posed a risk to
    her mental status, her treatment needs, and the safety of the public. There is
    a clear body of evidence supporting this conclusion. The facts demonstrate </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>that over</span><span lang=EN-US> a number
    of months, the treatment team attempted to manage the appellant’s access to
    drugs and alcohol, but she continued to access and consume them. This was
    risking her well-being. Moreover, the evidence clearly showed that she posed an
    increased risk to the community when abusing drugs and alcohol. The risk to the
    community includes the risk to other patients and hospital staff: <em>Chaudry</em>,
    at paras. 80-81. </span></p>

    appellant moved to the FAU, it would have been more onerous and restrictive to
    keep her on the FRU. This conclusion was supported by the evidence that she was
    confined to the FRU, her privileges had been revoked, and she was heading in
    the direction of one-on-one supervision. </span></p>

    notify the Board under s. 672.56(2) of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>the Royal
    violated her s. 7 <i>Charter </i>right to life, liberty and security of the
    person. As a remedy under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>, the appellant asks that
    the Royal be directed to “review its procedures concerning restrictions of
    liberty”. </p>
