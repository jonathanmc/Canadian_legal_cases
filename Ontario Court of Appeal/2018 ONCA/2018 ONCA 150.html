    the Superior Court of Justice, dated August 23, 2016, with reasons reported at
    2016 ONSC 5331. </p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Trotter J.A.</strong><strong><span style='font-weight:

  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal deals with the division of a federal pension as family
    property under the <em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (the “<em>FLA</em>”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has a Canadian Forces pension, provided by the <em>Canadian
    Forces Superannuation Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-17 (the “<em>CFSA</em>”). The
    parties agreed that the commuted value of the pension was $747,200. The pension
    has matured and is “in pay”, meaning that the appellant receives monthly payments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To satisfy an equalization payment of $313,002, the trial judge ordered
    that an application be made to the pension administrator of the Canadian Forces
    pension to transfer this amount to the respondent. The appellant would have
    preferred to pay the respondent on a monthly basis by having her pension
    payments split at source. The respondent wanted an immediate lump-sum transfer.
    The trial judge held that the <em>Pension Benefits Division Act</em>, S.C.
    1992, c. 46, Sch. II (the “<em>PBDA</em>”), under which the <em>CFSA</em><i> </i>pension
    is administered, only allows for a lump-sum division. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained below, I agree with the trial judge’s interpretation of the <em>PBDA</em> – it contains no provision that would enable the pension administrator
    to divide monthly payments. Moreover, the trial judge’s order was not precluded
    by the pension division provisions of the <em>FLA</em>. I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the facts</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Parties </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties are both in their 50’s. They cohabited for three years
    before marrying in 1994. They separated in July of 2013. They have three
    children who were ages 21, 19, and 17 at the time of trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the primary income-earner during the marriage. She
    joined the Canadian Forces before she married the respondent. She retired in
    2008 and started drawing her Canadian Forces pension. The appellant now enjoys
    success as a financial planner/advisor with the Royal Bank of Canada. She has
    pensions from the Royal Bank Pension Plan and RBC Dominion Securities Pension
    Plan, but they have yet to mature.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the relationship, the respondent qualified as a teacher. He
    became a substitute teacher in 2005, and then a permanent, full-time teacher in
    2011. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Proceedings at Trial</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were able to settle many of the issues arising from the
    breakdown of their marriage. They went to trial to resolve questions of child
    support, special expenses, and property issues. This appeal is only concerned
    with the division of the appellant’s Canadian Forces pension. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In ascertaining the value of this pension, the parties relied upon a
    letter sent to the appellant by National Defence. This letter, dated August 28,
    2014, is significant because it also highlights the restrictions placed upon
    the administrator of the <em>CFSA</em> pension. As the letter states:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Below you will find the financial information you requested
    under Section 13(2) of the Pension Benefits Division Act (PBDA), with respect
    to your pension entitlement under the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Tim Fawcett would receive approximately $373,600.00 as a
    result of the division of your pension for the cohabitation period of 14 May
    1994 to 24 July 2013. <b>This one-time lump sum payment <u>must</u> be
    deposited into his locked-in RRSP account.</b> There would be a corresponding
    reduction to your pension of approximately $1,145.56 per month. For the
    cohabitation period of 14 May 1994 to 8 March 2014 the approximate amount is
    $374,900.00. The corresponding reduction to your pension is 1,149.67 per month.
    When indexed, the increase to your pension would be based on the amount
    remaining after the reduction, <b>which is for life.</b> [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge heard evidence from an actuary, Guy Martel. Mr. Martel prepared a
    report on the family law value of the appellant’s other pension benefits. He
    also provided an opinion on the appropriate tax rate to be applied to discount
    the appellant’s Canadian Forces pension. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    his testimony, Mr. Martel was asked about the administration of the Canadian
    Forces pension. He explained the differences between a division of <em>CFSA</em> pension benefits and pensions governed by provincial legislation. Mr. Martel
    testified that the <em>PBDA</em> only allows for a lump-sum division. As he
    said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Canadian Forces pension that falls under the <i>Pension
    Benefits Division Act</i>, that would also cover the <i>Public Service
    Superannuation Act</i>, [the] <i>RCMP Superannuation Act</i>, the Members of
    Parliament Retirement Allowance – those, those plans under the [<i>PBDA</i>], … <u>the only option basically is to transfer a lump-sum amount up to 50 percent
    of the maximum transferable amount, regardless of whether … the separation is
    before or after retirement</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    follow up questions, Mr. Martel confirmed that the “only way” to divide the <em>CFSA</em> pension is through a lump-sum transfer, and if the parties wished to do things
    differently, “the Forces will [be] unable to persist [<em>sic</em>] in that.”
    As discussed below, the trial judge interpreted the applicable legislation the
    same way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant argued that the </span><em>FLA</em> <span lang=EN-GB>determines how her Canadian Forces pension should be treated
    as family property. Because her pension is in pay, s. 10.1(5) of the </span><em>FLA</em><span
lang=EN-GB> precludes a lump-sum division; she could only be ordered to split
    her monthly pension payments. The appellant argued that the </span><em>Pension
    Benefits Standards Act, 1985</em><span lang=EN-GB>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 32 (2nd
    Supp.) allowed for the division of her monthly pension payments. The trial
    judge disagreed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant made the alternative submission
    that, if the trial judge were to order a lump-sum transfer, he should exercise
    his discretion under s. 9(1)(c) of the </span><em>FLA</em><span lang=EN-GB> to
    delay payment for 10 years, based on a claim of hardship. The trial judge
    flatly rejected this request, at para. 15:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>However, her counsel did not explain how or
    why the immediate lump sum payment would create hardship. Not only did she not
    address it, but it is hard to understand the basic argument given that her lead
    position was to split the income stream at source. <u>The pension income that
    the applicant is currently receiving would be similarly reduced in both
    scenarios.</u> Further, the applicant’s counsel did not provide any plan or
    proposal; she simply made the argument without detail or thought as to how it
    would work. Specifically she did not address how the respondent would be fairly
    compensated for such a delay. <u>My sense was that rather than wanting to avoid
    hardship, which was not established, the applicant was seeking to gain an
    advantage for herself at the respondent’s expense. I decline to make that
    order.</u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ordered the appellant to make an equalization payment of $313,002
    “by way of a PBDA transfer from her Canadian Forces pension, which is the
    $281,224 equalization payment grossed-up for taxes by 11.3 percent.”</p>

  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial and on appeal, counsel focused their submissions on whether the administrator
    of the Canadian Forces pension could be ordered to split monthly payments at
    source. I agree with the trial judge that the <em>PBDA</em>, in conjunction
    with related federal statutes, does not enable a judge to order the
    administrator to split monthly payments for the purposes of dividing family
    property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with the appellant’s submission that s. 10.1(5) of the <em>FLA</em> precluded
    the trial judge from ordering a lump-sum division because her pension was in pay.
    I would not interpret s. 10.1 of the <em>FLA</em> in this manner. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Federal Pension Legislation</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are numerous statutes that create and govern the administration of federal
    pensions. The appellant’s Canadian Forces pension entitlement derives from the <em>CFSA</em>;
    however, it does not determine how the pension is dealt with as family or
    matrimonial property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>PBDA</em> governs the division of <em>CFSA</em> pensions, as well as pensions
    granted under many other federal statutes.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> By virtue of s. 3 of the <em>PBDA</em>, Parliament has signalled the primacy of
    this Act:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>3</b>        In the event of any inconsistency between this
    Act and the regulations made under this Act <u>and any other law</u>, this Act
    and the regulations shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The respondent contends that the section trumps all provincial
    law, including the <em>FLA</em>. I disagree. Section 3 merely prioritizes the <em>PBDA</em> over other federal enactments. Conflicts between provincial and federal
    legislation must be resolved by the federal paramountcy doctrine. However, the
    issue on this appeal may be resolved without resort to this doctrine.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed below, the relationship between the <em>PBDA</em> and the <em>FLA</em> is not seamless. Nevertheless, courts must strive to interpret related federal
    and provincial enactments in a harmonious manner. As Ruth Sullivan observes in <em>Statutory
    Interpretation</em>, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2016), at p. 184, “the
    Supreme Court of Canada has shown a strong inclination to harmonize the
    legislation of federal, provincial and territorial jurisdictions dealing with
    the same subject matter” in a number of areas, including matrimonial property
    rights. By way of example, she refers to <em>Clarke v. Clarke</em>, [1990] 2
    S.C.R. 795, a leading matrimonial property case, in which the Court read the <em>CFSA</em> and the <em>Matrimonial Property Act</em>, S.N.S. 1980, c. 9 harmoniously,
    thereby avoiding a conflict and the need to invoke the paramountcy doctrine. In <em>Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canada (Human Resources and Social
    Development)</em>, 2011 SCC 60, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 635, Deschamps J. referred
    favourably to <em>Clarke</em> and said, at para. 22: “A federal provision that
    appears to be prohibitive may, upon consideration of its legislative purpose,
    prove to be compatible with a permissive provision.” See also <em>Alberta
    (Attorney General) v. Moloney</em>, 2015 SCC 51, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 327, at para.
    26. Employing the same approach, the <em>FLA</em> and the <em>PBDA</em> may be
    interpreted harmoniously in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>PBDA</em> only provides for a lump-sum division of a member’s pension,
    whether the pension is in pay or not. A division is triggered by an application
    under s. 4, which provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>4&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</b>A member of a pension plan or a spouse,
    former spouse or former common-law partner of a member may, in the
    circumstances described in subsection (2), apply to the Minister to divide the
    member’s pension benefits between the member and the spouse, former spouse or
    former common-law partner.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>(2)</b>&nbsp;The circumstances in which an application may
    be made are:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>(a)</b>&nbsp;where a court in
    Canada of competent jurisdiction, in proceedings in relation to divorce,
    annulment of marriage or separation, makes an order that provides for the
    pension benefits to be divided between the member and the spouse, former spouse

    manner in which the pension is divided is addressed in s. 8. It does not
    facilitate a simple cash payment to the non-member spouse; it provides for a
    one-time transfer of funds into locked-in financial instruments. As s. 8
    provides:</p>

    borne out by the plain language of the provision. It is in accord with the
    National Defence letter in para. 9, above. It is consistent with Mr. Martel’s
    understanding of the <em>PBDA</em>. Moreover, this feature of the <em>PBDA</em> has long been recognized: see Ontario Law Reform Commission, <em>Report on
    Pensions as Family Property: Valuation and Division</em> (Toronto: Ontario Law
    Reform Commission, 1995), at pp. 62, 171-172; Thomas G. Anderson, Q.C., “Pension

    to be split at source as family or matrimonial property. I disagree. This Act
    only applies to the enforcement of support orders.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    90 of the <em>CFSA</em> incorporates the operation of the <em>GAPDA</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>Diversion of payments to satisfy financial support order</b></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>90(1)</b> When any court in Canada of competent jurisdiction
    has made an order requiring a recipient to pay financial support, <u>amounts
    payable</u> under Part I, I.1 or III to that recipient are subject to being

    Attachment and Pension Diversion Act</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Part II of the <em>GAPDA</em><i> </i>is titled,
    “Diversion of Pension Benefits to Satisfy Financial Support Orders”. Section 31
    clarifies the limited scope of this Part of the Act:</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span

    “financial support order” is defined in s. 32(1) in the following way:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><i>financial support order</i></b> means, subject to
    subsection (2), an order or judgment for maintenance, alimony or support,
    including an order or judgment for arrears of payments, made pursuant to the <i>Divorce

  <p class=BContinuingPara>Near identical provisions were considered in <em>Clarke</em>.
    Writing for the Court, Wilson J. held, at p. 832, that a “financial support
    order” does not encompass “matrimonial property”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, federal legislation does not clothe the <em>PBDA</em> administrator
    with the power to split pension payments as a method of dividing family
    property. Consequently, the administrator cannot be ordered to do so. Parliament
    could create such a power. It has chosen not to. Indeed, in the recent case of <em>Francis</em>,
    the federal Crown successfully argued that there is no jurisdiction to order
    the administrator to divide pension payments as family property under the <em>PBDA</em>.
    I agree with the analysis in that decision.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part
    I of the <em>FLA</em> addresses issues of family property. Section 5 creates a <em>prima
    facie</em> entitlement to an equal division of net family property. Section 9
    empowers a court to order equalization payments, and to make collateral orders to
    secure their performance. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interest of one spouse in another’s pension benefits has long been recognized
    as a matter of matrimonial or family property: see <em>Clarke</em>, at p. 824. In
    2009, the <em>FLA</em><i> </i>was amended (s. 2009, c. 11) to create specific
    rules, contained in s. 10.1, about the division of pension entitlements.
    Subsections 10.1(3), (4), and (5) provide:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>(3) </b>An order made under section 9 or 10 <u>may</u> provide for the immediate transfer of a lump sum out of a pension plan but, <u>except
    as permitted under subsection (5)</u>, not for any other division of a spouse’s
    interest in the plan.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>(4)</b> In determining whether to order the immediate
    transfer of a lump sum out of a pension plan and in determining the amount to
    be transferred, the court may consider the following matters and such other
    matters as the court considers appropriate:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. The nature of the assets
    available to each spouse at the time of the hearing.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. The proportion of a spouse’s net
    family property that consists of the imputed value, for family law purposes, of
    his or her interest in the pension plan.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. The liquidity of the lump sum in
    the hands of the spouse to whom it would be transferred.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>4. Any contingent tax liabilities
    in respect of the lump sum that would be transferred.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5. The resources available to each
    spouse to meet his or her needs in retirement and the desirability of
    maintaining those resources.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>(5)</b> If payment of the first instalment of a spouse’s
    pension under a pension plan is due on or before the valuation date, an order
    made under section 9 or 10 <u>may</u> provide for the division of pension
    payments <u>but not for any other division of the spouse’s interest in the plan.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the combined operation of ss. (3) and (5) precludes a lump-sum
    division when a pension is in pay. Some cases support this interpretation (see,
    for example, <em>Jovanovic v. Jovanovic</em>, 2013 ONSC 7132, [2014] W.D.F.L.
    461, at para. 40). However, I would not read these provisions so restrictively,
    especially without clear statutory language that prohibits a lump-sum transfer when
    a pension is in pay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection
    10.1(3) creates a general power to order an immediate lump-sum division. The
    availability of this permissive option is guided by the non-exhaustive criteria
    in s. (4). Subsection (5) addresses pensions in pay. In these circumstances, a
    judge <em>may</em> make an order for the division of pension payments, “but not
    for <em>any other</em> division of the spouse’s interest in the plan” (emphasis
    added). I do not read this section as prohibiting a lump-sum transfer for a
    pension in pay. Instead, s. 10.1(5) simply provides courts with another option
    – division of payments. However, just like s. 10.1(3), s. 10.1(5) only allows a
    judge to order one form of division – lump-sum or pension payments – not both,
    and not any other form of division of the interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    combined operation of ss. 10.1(3) and (5) leads to the following options.
    Before a pension is in pay, only a lump-sum division is available. This makes
    sense because there is no monthly payment stream to divide. Once a pension is
    in pay, a judge may choose between the two options, depending on all of the
    circumstances of the case. Whether or not a pension is in pay, the factors set
    out in s. 10.1(4) provide guidance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s restrictive interpretation of s. 10.1 potentially compromises an
    important goal of the <em>FLA</em> – to achieve a division of assets that is fair
    to both parties. In <em>Best v. Best</em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 868, Major J. said, at
    para. 109: “The choice of a method for settlement of the equalization
    obligation is highly contextual and fact-based. A payment method that is
    preferable in one case might be grossly unjust in another.” The interpretation
    favoured by the appellant would undermine this approach by precluding resort to
    an option (a lump-sum payment) that may be critical in achieving a fair and
    just division of property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    broader interpretation s. 10.1(5) of the <em>FLA</em> is more compatible with
    the <em>PBDA</em>. Returning to the paramountcy jurisprudence, Gascon J. said
    in <em>Moloney</em>, at para. 27: “It is presumed that Parliament intends its
    laws to co-exist with provincial laws.” This presumption must also apply in
    reverse, and with at least equal force – it is presumed that the province
    intends its laws to co-exist with federal laws. I am unable to find that the
    Legislature intended to undermine or limit the operation of the <em>PBDA</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Ontario amended the <em>FLA</em><i> </i>in 2009 to create s. 10.1, it would
    surely have known that the <em>PBDA</em> only provides for a lump-sum division:
    see Ontario Law Reform Commission, <em>Report on Pensions as Family Property</em>,
    at pp. 62, 171-172. See also, Law Commission of Ontario, <em>Division of Pensions
    Upon Marriage Breakdown – Final Report</em> (Toronto: Law Commission of
    Ontario, 2008). As noted in para. 18 above, the <em>PBDA</em> applies to
    pensions created by many federal statutes, no doubt affecting the pensions of
    countless Ontarians. I would avoid an interpretation of the <em>FLA</em> that
    frustrates the <em>PBDA</em>. A broader interpretation of s. 10.1(5) advances
    the goals of the <em>FLA</em>, while achieving harmony with federal pension
    legislation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not say that it will always be appropriate to order a lump-sum division of a
    pension in pay. It will depend on the nature of the underlying pension
    legislation, the application of the criteria listed in s. 10.1(4) of the <em>FLA</em>,
    and “such other matters as the court considers appropriate” to achieve a just
    result in the case: see <em>VanderWal v. VanderWal</em>, 2015 ONSC 384, 54
    R.F.L. (7th) 410, at para. 9.</p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Application to This Case</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not err in ordering a lump-sum transfer of the appellant’s
    pension. This method of division involves little downside to the appellant. She
    does not have to “find” the money or arrange financing to satisfy the equalization
    payment: see <em>Boston v. Boston</em>, 2001 SCC 43, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 413, at
    paras. 51 and 60. The pension is divided at source. Moreover, as the trial judge
    recognized, a lump-sum division puts the appellant in the same monthly position
    had her pension payments been split at source.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, under the <em>PBDA</em>, the respondent will benefit from an
    immediate, one-time transfer of the property to which he is entitled: see <em>Symmons
    v. Symmons</em>, 2012 ONCA 747, 298 O.A.C. 224, at paras. 37-39. This, in turn,
    will better facilitate a “clean break” between the parties, avoiding the
    potential for future disputes: see <em>Clarke</em>, at p. 836; and <em>Best</em>,
    at paras. 109 and 111.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge observed, the appellant is not interested in this arrangement;
    she seemed intent on putting the respondent at a disadvantage. To a certain
    extent, this posture continues on appeal. In the circumstances, an order that requires
    the appellant to pay the respondent each month is a recipe for conflict and
    more litigation. This is avoided by the trial judge’s order.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>disposition</h1>

    trial judge did not err in the manner in which he interpreted applicable
    provincial and federal legislation. The order that he made was both available
    to him under the law and appropriate in the circumstances. Accordingly, I would
    dismiss the appeal and order costs to the respondent in amount of $10,000,
    inclusive of disbursements and HST.</p>
