'>I<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE BACKGROUND</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A host of computer applications have been developed for the purpose of
    allowing individual computer users to obtain and share information over the
    internet. They use what are referred to as “peer-to-peer” networks. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force uses sophisticated investigative
    software to investigate suspected child pornography possessors and traffickers
    within these peer-to-peer networks. The Task Force suspected that internet
    protocol (“IP”) address 24.109.39.74 (the “Address”) was downloading and
    sharing child pornography on the internet through a peer-to-peer file sharing
    software program. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of the Task Force’s suspicions, Detective Constable Erkkila
    began monitoring the Address in November 2012.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On December 2, 2012, Erkkila identified and downloaded a suspect file
    located at the Address. Erkkila was not satisfied that the downloaded images
    that were able to be viewed met the definition of child pornography, although
    one image showed a naked prepubescent female who appeared to be approximately
    10 years of age. She lay on her back, on a red shag carpet, with her body
    oriented away from the camera.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 40-digit “peer ID number”, that is, the serial number identifying
    the specific installation of the file sharing software on the computer from
    which Erkkila downloaded the file, was recorded. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Information about the general geographic location of the Address was
    publicly available over the internet. The Address was registered to Shaw
    Communications Inc. On December 3, 2012, Erkkila submitted a Law Enforcement
    Request (“LER”) to Shaw, requesting the subscriber information for the Address.
    On December 5, 2012, Shaw provided the name and precise municipal address of
    the account holder, the appellant’s spouse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 31, 2012, Erkkila downloaded from the Address two different files that
    police investigative software flagged as suspect. Both contained images of
    child pornography. At the time of each download, the 40-digit peer ID number indicating
    the specific installation of software on the suspect computer from which the
    file was downloaded was recorded. One set of downloaded images featured a
    prepubescent female who appeared to be between 8 and 10 years of age. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erkkila
    obtained a search warrant to search the house located at the address disclosed
    by Shaw in response to the LER and to search and seize the computer systems and
    all related devices and data located in the house. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence seized as a result of that search led to the appellant’s conviction
    for possession of child pornography.</p>
  <p class=MHeading12 align=left style='text-align:left;
'>II<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE <em>CHARTER</em> APPEAL</p>
  <p class=Heading>The reasons below</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    year and a half after Erkkila submitted the LER to Shaw, the Supreme Court, in <em>R.
    v. Spencer</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2014 SCC 43, [2014]
    2 S.C.R. 212, determined that a police request that an internet service
    provider disclose subscriber information amounts to a search, and, if prior
    judicial authorization is not obtained, violates the subscriber’s rights under
    s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying <em>Spencer</em> in his Reasons on <em>Charter</em> Application, the trial
    judge found that Erkkila would not have had reasonable and probable grounds to
    obtain a judicial authorization at the time that he submitted the LER, and
    therefore, although consistent with police practice at the time, the LER was
    obtained in breach of the appellant’s <em>Charter</em> rights. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then applied the three-pronged test in <em>R. v. Grant</em>, 2009
    SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, to determine if the admission of the evidence
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, or if the evidence
    should be admitted under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> He
    found that the first <em>Grant</em> consideration – the seriousness of the <em>Charter</em>-infringing
    State conduct – favoured inclusion of the evidence. Erkkila was simply
    following procedures that, in the pre-<em>Spencer</em> world, he reasonably
    believed to be lawful. The second <em>Grant</em> consideration – the impact of
    the <em>Charter</em> breach on Mr. Capancioni’s <em>Charter</em>-protected
    interests – favoured excluding the evidence. The violation of an individual’s
    privacy rights is a serious matter. The third <em>Grant</em> factor – society’s
    interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits – favoured the inclusion
    of the evidence. The evidence sought to be excluded was crucial to establishing
    that Mr. Capancioni accessed, possessed and made available child pornography.
    Balancing these three factors, the trial judge concluded that the exclusion of
    the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to the appellant’s argument that the Information to
    Obtain (the “ITO”) the search warrant did not contain full and frank disclosure
    and misstated the facts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Erkkila
    acknowledged that he had mistakenly stated in the ITO that the same peer ID number
    was identified on his download of the file on December 2, and on the downloads
    of the two files on December 31. In fact, the first 16 digits of the 40-digit
    number were the same. Erkkila explained that he looked at the first 12 or 16
    digits and, because they were the same, assumed that it was the same peer ID
    number. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that there was no bad faith, and that Erkkila’s error was
    inadvertent and inconsequential. In the trial judge’s view, if the erroneous
    information were removed, the ITO provided reasonable and probable grounds for
    the issuance of the warrant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explained that Erkkila: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[W]as very clear in his evidence that it is the IPA number, the
    internet protocol number, which identifies the internet location that the
    computer is attached to. It is the IP address that provides the link to the
    geographical address. The peer ID number does not assist in connecting the
    virtual world to the geographical location of the computer. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the IP addresses were reported as being the same and they
    were in fact not, that would be a matter of consequence with respect to the ITO
    and the issuance of the search warrant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that there was no breach of Mr. Capancioni’s s. 8 <em>Charter</em> rights “as it relates to the Information to Obtain”. Given that conclusion, he
    did not address s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, the Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in his <em>Charter</em> analysis in relation to the error contained in the ITO. In determining whether
    there were reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant, the
    trial judge should have excluded the information obtained pursuant to the LER,
    and not just the erroneous information about the peer ID number.  The Crown
    concedes that without that information, the warrant to search the residence
    clearly could not have issued. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span

    conclusion that the “peer ID number does not assist in connecting the virtual

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the ITO, Erkkila explained that an IP address
    can be static or dynamic, meaning that the subscriber’s IP address may change.
    He indicated that, in his experience, Shaw subscribers “typically” have a
    dynamic IP address “but they may keep the same IP address for longer periods of
    time ranging from several days to several months.” </span></p>

    asserts that if the peer ID number had been the same on December 31 as on
    December 2, the fact that it was the same would have provided certainty that
    the Address had not been assigned to a different Shaw subscriber, located at a
    different address, after Shaw responded to the LER, and that, at the time that Erkkila
    swore the ITO, the Address remained associated with Mr. Capancioni’s residence.
    Mr. Capancioni asserts that without such corroboration, the issuing judge could
    not have issued the warrant. Therefore, he submits, although Erkkila’s mistake
    was inadvertent and there was no bad faith, his mistake was nonetheless serious <em>Charter</em>-infringing state conduct, and weighs in favour of the
    exclusion of the evidence. </span></p>

    of the house, logically, had the peer ID number been the same at the time of
    the downloads on December 31 as on December 2, it would have had some
    corroborative value.  However, I would not characterize Erkkila’s mistake about
    the peer ID number as serious <em>Charter</em>-infringing state conduct
    favouring exclusion of the evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning first to the corroborative effect, Erkkila
    testified that the peer ID number is not information that he required to
    determine the location of the house, and that he included the peer ID number
    because he had this information during the investigation and wanted to ensure
    that he provided full, fair and frank disclosure to the issuing justice. Erkkila
    testified that the Address was in fact a static address.<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

    had “the same Internet Protocol address on three different occasions…between
    the 2nd and 31st”, and that he did not require another LER to confirm that the
    Address remained associated with the same subscriber.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In lay terms, Erkkila explained that a peer ID number
    is specific to a program on a particular device. The IP address is associated
    with the router </span>–<span lang=EN-US> the physical point at which internet
    access is provided to a residence or business. When internet is provided to the
    residence or business through the router, multiple devices </span>–<span
lang=EN-US> including those of visitors to the residence or business </span>–<span
lang=EN-US> can access the internet. The peer ID number permits police to
    determine which device accessed the internet through the IP address under
    investigation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If the peer ID number had been the same on
    December 31 as on December 2, it would have indicated that on both December 2
    and December 31 the same device accessed the internet through the Address. In
    light of the information in the ITO that Shaw IP addresses are “typically” dynamic,
    logically, this could have provided the issuing justice with greater certainty
    that, on December 31, the Address remained associated with the same subscriber,
    and therefore the same municipal address, as on December 2. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, for several reasons I conclude that Erkkila’s
    mistake in the ITO with respect to the peer ID number is not state conduct that
    favours exclusion of the evidence seized under the first <em>Grant</em> factor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the first line of inquiry under <em>Grant</em> necessitates an evaluation of the seriousness of the state conduct that led to
    the violation of the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em></span>–<span
lang=EN-US> in this case the unlawful search of Mr. Capancioni’s residence. The
    state conduct that led to the violation of the <em>Charter</em> was the
    unlawful search by making the LER. Without the information obtained in response
    to the LER, Erkkila could not and would not have sought the warrant. In light
    of this, his subsequent mistake in the ITO with respect to the peer ID number
    was, as the trial judge found (albeit for different reasons), inconsequential.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the trial judge accepted Erkkila’s
    evidence that he did not rely on the peer ID number in determining the location
    of the house. As the trial judge erroneously considered the evidence in
    response to the LER linking Mr. Capancioni’s house to the Address on December
    3, he effectively considered the significance of Erkkila’s error on a
    stand-alone basis. He found that Erkkila’s error was inconsequential and there
    was sufficient information in the ITO to establish that evidence of child pornography
    would probably be found if Mr. Capancioni’s house and computer were searched. Although
    the peer ID number had some corroborative value, if the information in response
    to the LER linking Mr. Capancioni’s home to the Address could have been
    considered, this finding may well have been open to the trial judge given: the
    evidence of how and why the Task Force had identified the Address as suspect;
    the evidence of the photo of the nude pre-pubescent girl, approximately 10
    years of age, downloaded via the Address on December 2; and the 77 images of
    child pornography downloaded on December 31 some of which featured a nude
    pre-pubescent girl who appeared to be between the ages of 8 and 10. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, and significantly, Erkkila’s mistake was
    inadvertent, and there was no bad faith. His mistake was made in the context of
    rapidly evolving technology. Two different peer ID numbers were associated with
    Mr. Capancioni’s computer on December 31. This was the first investigation that
    Erkkila – an uncontested expert in the field of computer forensics who had been
    involved in approximately 40 to 50 child pornography investigations – had been
    involved with where the peer ID number changed. </span></p>

    available child pornography requires proof of the intent to make computer files
    containing child pornography available to others using that program or actual

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Then, at para. 51, the trial judge concluded as

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>... I am satisfied that </span><em><span

    child pornography and that these images were made available by the accused,
    Robert Capancioni. Having said this, I can indicate that I am not satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt, in examining the totality of the evidence, that the
    Crown has proven that Robert Capancioni had the intent to make child
    pornography available to others. From the evidence </span><em><span lang=EN-US>it
    is entirely possible that Robert Capancioni was transferring images from his

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the Crown that the trial judge
    erred by requiring the Crown to prove a more onerous <em>mens rea</em> element
    than required. Section 163.1(3) distinguishes between overt acts of
    dissemination, such as distribution, and the facilitation of the carrying out
    of those acts, such as “make available”: see </span><em>Spencer</em><span

lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown was not required to prove that Mr.

    evidence that the images downloaded to the police investigative computer on
    December 31, 2012 had resided on Mr. Capancioni’s computer and were available
    to other members of the Azureus network since early August 2012. As the Crown

    satisfies the test in <em>R. v. Graveline</em>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R.

    a verdict of guilty and remit the matter back to the trial judge for
    sentencing. I disagree. In my view, a new trial is required. The trial judge’s
    finding at para. 46 is prefaced by the words “it would be difficult to
    believe”.  The <em>mens rea</em> requirement must be established beyond a
    reasonable doubt. Arguably, para. 46 is not a clear finding that the trial
    judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Capancioni knew, or was
