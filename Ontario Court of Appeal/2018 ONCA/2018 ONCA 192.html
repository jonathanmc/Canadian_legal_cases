  <p class=Heard>Heard: May 23, 2017</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court
    (Marrocco A.C.J., Herold and Whitten JJ.), dated January 18, 2016, with reasons
    reported at 2016 ONSC 442.</p>
  <p><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal involves the intersection of
    bankruptcy law and the doctrine of subrogation. It considers whether an insurer
    was entitled to commence a subrogated claim in the name of its bankrupt
    insured.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellants that the insurer was
    not entitled to do so in these circumstances. At the time this action was
    commenced, the insured’s cause of action had vested in his trustee in
    bankruptcy and the insured was an undischarged bankrupt. As a result, the
    insured lacked capacity to bring the action, and the insurer could not commence
    a subrogated claim in his name. I would allow the appeal, and would grant
    summary judgment to the appellants, dismissing the subrogated action commenced by
    the insurer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Below, I provide an overview of the facts leading
    to this appeal, the reasons of the motion judge and the Divisional Court below,
    and the parties’ positions on this appeal. I then discuss the doctrine of
    subrogation and the relevant provisions of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the
    “BIA”) before turning to my analysis of the issues raised.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Art and Wendy Douglas purchased a home in
    Kingston, Ontario and arranged for the appellants to deliver fuel oil to their
    home. On January 9, 2008, fuel oil was delivered to the Douglases’ external oil
    tank. It is alleged that the fuel oil subsequently escaped and contaminated the
    Douglases’ property. Mr. Douglas informed the appellants about the oil spill
    and Stan Fergusson Fuels Ltd. alerted an emergency response service provider,
    who in turn engaged an environmental clean-up company.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The following day, the Douglases’ insurer, State
    Farm Fire and Casualty Company (“State Farm”), appointed an adjuster, who
    determined that their Homeowners Policy provided coverage for losses associated
    with the spill. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the time of the oil leak, Wendy Douglas had
    no ownership interest in the property. Several months prior, on November 14,
    2007, she had been discharged from bankruptcy subject to the stipulation that
    her interest in the property remained vested in her trustee in bankruptcy (the
    “Trustee”). The Trustee remained on title to the property, together with Mr.
    Douglas. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The adjuster for the appellants sent invoices
    from the January clean-up to State Farm on March 17, 2008. State Farm paid the
    invoices, and advised that it intended to recover these and any future clean-up
    costs from the appellants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Homeowners Policy contains a subrogation
    clause that provides (in relevant part) as follows::</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>We will be entitled to assume all <strong>your</strong> rights
    of recovery against others and bring action in <strong>your</strong><span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'> name</span></span> to
    enforce these rights when <strong>we</strong> make payment or assume liability
    under this policy. [Emphasis in original.<u>]</u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As the Divisional Court found, by this point it
    was clear that State Farm had assumed liability under the Homeowners Policy and
    was entitled to assume Mr. Douglas’s right of recovery and sue in his name to
    enforce that right. Over the ensuing months, State Farm continued to make
    payments on the policy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On or about June 4, 2009, Mr. Douglas filed an
    assignment in bankruptcy. The Trustee also became Mr. Douglas’s trustee in
    bankruptcy and replaced him on the title to the property. The Trustee advised
    State Farm of this assignment on June 5, 2009. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The week before Mr. Douglas filed his assignment,
    the Trustee signed a document entitled the “Trustee’s Limited Disclaimer” (the
    “Disclaimer”). The Disclaimer was addressed to State Farm, and recited the
    Trustee’s intention to sell the property as soon as it was remediated. It also
    disclaimed interest in insurance claims by the Douglases “for loss or damage in
    the oil spill to matrimonial household contents not affixed or enjoyed with the
    residential property or proceeds of personal property exempt under the <em>Execution
    Act </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(Ontario)</span></em> which would
    not vest in their Trustee in Bankruptcy.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>State Farm paid out the Douglases’ personal
    contents claims, totaling $8,760.60, to them directly in July 2009. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In October 2009, the Trustee sold the remediated
    property and satisfied the creditors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>State Farm made its final payments under the
    policy in November 2009. In total, State Farm spent over $800,000 to remediate
    the property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On January 7, 2010, State Farm commenced this
    action against the appellants in the names of Art Douglas and Wendy Douglas. The
    damages claimed are not restricted to those described in the Disclaimer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The action was commenced prior to Mr. Douglas’s
    discharge from bankruptcy. Art Douglas received an absolute discharge from
    bankruptcy on March 5, 2010, and the Trustee was discharged in respect of his
    bankruptcy on August 24, 2012.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue of the Douglases’ capacity to bring
    this action came before the court in 2013, when the appellants brought a
    summary judgment motion, arguing that the Douglases lacked capacity to commence
    the action because of their bankruptcies, and accordingly State Farm’s action
    in their names was a nullity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>State Farm brought a cross-motion for: (a)
    directions with respect to the continuation of the action in the Douglases’ or
    its own name; (b) alternatively, for a declaration that it was the <em>dominus
    litis</em> and had the right to continue and control the action to pursue its
    subrogated claim; and (c) in the further alternative, an order permitting it to
    amend its statement of claim to plead that the plaintiffs were “Art Douglas and
    Wendy Douglas by their Subrogee State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Company”.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS BELOW</span></p>
  <h6>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Motion Judge’s Reasons</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge granted State Farm’s request
    for a declaration that it was the <em>dominus litis</em>, and dismissed the
    appellants’ motion to strike the claim. He also ordered that State Farm had the
    right to continue and control the action without needing to amend its statement
    of claim to add State Farm as a party. Reasons for this decision were reported
    at <em>Douglas v. Stan Ferguson Fuels Ltd.</em><i>, </i>2014 ONSC 4709.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge found, at paras. 48-51, that
    State Farm’s right of subrogation was a “contingent right” that vested at the
    time the policy was entered into and that State Farm became, at common law, the <em>dominus litis</em> once the Douglases were fully indemnified. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge wrote, at para. 56, that he was
    “not persuaded that the [BIA] extinguishes or trumps the subrogation rights of
    State Farm, which vested at the time that the policy was entered into and which
    remained in place at the date of loss.” Further, he was not persuaded that
    permitting the claim to proceed would subvert the bankruptcy scheme. He noted that
    the Trustee had satisfied the claims of creditors by selling the property,
    which could not have been sold but for the remediation paid for by State Farm.
    He concluded that an inequitable result would prevail if State Farm could not
    prosecute its claim and that he had the inherent jurisdiction under ss. 96 and
    97 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43, to grant
    declaratory relief in the circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, at para. 54 of his reasons, the motion
    judge reasoned that to grant the motion to strike would “incorrectly emphasize form
    over substance.”</span></p>
  <h6>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court’s Reasons</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Justice Hackland granted the appellants’ motion
    for leave to appeal to the Divisional Court, with reasons reported at <em>Douglas
    v. Stan Fergusson Fuels Ltd.</em><i>,</i> 2015 ONSC 65. He doubted the
    correctness of the motion judge’s decision on the basis that it is well-settled
    law that the Douglases lost their right to deal with their property, including
    causes of action arising from the oil spill, upon their bankruptcies</span><span
class=MsoHyperlink><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none'>. </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At para. 8, he concluded
    that because subrogated claims are derivative in nature and an undischarged
    bankrupt is unable to bring an action to enforce property claims, so too was an
    insurer barred from commencing its derivative subrogation claim. He further commented,
    at para. 9, that State Farm was entitled to insist on an assignment from the
    Trustee so that its subrogation rights could be validly pursued, but had failed
    to do so before the limitation period expired.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, the Divisional Court dismissed the
    appellants’ appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It found, at para. 29, that State Farm had a
    “vested contingent right to assume Mr. Douglas’s right to recover and to bring
    an action” that crystallized when State Farm assumed liability for the loss on or
    about March 17, 2008. As a result, State Farm’s right to bring the action
    crystallized <span class=Underline>before</span> Mr. Douglas’s assignment into
    bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court reasoned, at para. 30, that
    “when Arthur Douglas made an assignment in favour of his creditors on June 4,
    2009, and his right to recover against the appellants vested in his Trustee, it
    was a right to recover, which was subject to State Farm’s vested right to
    assume it and State Farm’s vested right to commence an action in Mr. Douglas’s
    name to enforce it.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to Wendy Douglas, the Divisional
    Court found at para. 27 that, subject to applicable provincial exemptions,
    Wendy Douglas had no right of recovery for damages caused to the property. On
    the effective commencement date of the Homeowners Policy, she had already made
    an assignment in favour of her creditors. And after her subsequent discharge,
    her interest in the property remained vested in the Trustee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    permitting State Farm to continue the action in the name of Art Douglas would
    not impede the Trustee as the law is clear that an insured receives the

    not divisible among the bankrupt’s creditors pursuant to s. 67(1)(a); and a
    trustee may apply to the court pursuant to s. 40(2) of the BIA for directions

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US> </span>The Appellants’ Position</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants effectively make four
    submissions:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellants submit that the Divisional
    Court made a palpable and overriding error in concluding that, pursuant to the
    Disclaimer, the Trustee had disclaimed interest in the Douglases’ insurance
    claims arising out of the oil spill. This is because, in their view, the
    Disclaimer was limited to the personal property claims of the respondents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, they argue that the Divisional Court erred
    in its application of the principle of subrogation and the law as to the effect
    of a bankruptcy order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>They say recent English authority has clarified
    that the principle of subrogation only gives an insurer an interest in the
    recovered proceeds of an action, not a proprietary interest in the cause of
    action itself:<em> Ballast Plc, Re, </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>[2006]
    E.W.H.C. 3189, [2007] B.C.C. 620 (Eng. Ch. Div.)</span></em>. They argue that
    the subrogation clause in the Homeowners Policy did not effect an assignment or
    transfer of Mr. Douglas’s cause of action to State Farm. It only gave State
    Farm the limited right to commence whatever action was open to Mr. Douglas to
    commence, in his name. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, they argue that Mr. Douglas’s cause
    of action against them for losses arising out of the oil spill passed to and
    vested in the Trustee, and Mr. Douglas ceased to have capacity to commence an
    action upon his assignment in bankruptcy. In support of this principle, they
    cite this court’s decisions in <em>Meisels v. Lawyers Professional Indemnity Company</em>,
    2015 ONCA 406, 126 O.R. (3d) 448, at paras. 17 and 19; <em>Watt v. Beallor Beallor
    Burns Inc.</em> (2004), 1 C.B.R. (5<sup>th</sup>) 141 (Ont. S.C.), at paras. 2
    and 3, affirmed (2004), 1 C.B.R. (5<sup>th</sup>) 149 (Ont. C.A.); and <em>McNamara
    v. Pagecorp Inc.</em> (1989), 76 C.B.R. (N.S.) 97 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 2. Since
    Mr. Douglas did not have capacity to commence an action on January 7, 2010,
    State Farm could not commence an action in his name on that date.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In sum, they argue that the Divisional Court’s
    reasoning implicitly transformed State Farm’s subrogated interest in any
    damages Wendy and Art Douglas might recover into an assignment of their cause
    of action to State Farm.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the appellants allege that the Divisional
    Court erred in relying upon ss. 40(2) and 67(1)(a) of the BIA to support its
    decision. Section 40(2), reproduced below, requires a trustee in bankruptcy to
    return the bankrupt’s unrealizable property before the trustee’s discharge.
    With respect to s. 40(2), the appellants argue that there is no evidence that
    the Trustee had sought directions with respect to the cause of action, or that
    the Trustee had concluded that the cause of action was incapable of disposition. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 67(1)(a), also reproduced below,
    provides that property held by the bankrupt in trust for any other person is
    not divisible among the bankrupt’s creditors. With respect to s. 67(1)(a), the
    appellants contend that the property at issue in this case is the cause of
    action, and not the proceeds of recovery of that cause of action, and there is
    no authority for the proposition that the cause of action is held in trust for
    the insurer. They say that even though the net proceeds of that cause of
    action, as trust property, would not be divisible among the creditors of the
    bankrupt, the right to bring the cause of action vested in the Trustee. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, they submit that striking the claim
    that State Farm commenced in the name of the Douglases is not unjust. State
    Farm could have provided in the Homeowners Policy that the Douglases assigned
    their cause of action to State Farm.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondent’s Position</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I understand State Farm to raise five arguments
    in response.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, State Farm argues that the Divisional
    Court’s conclusion (that it was entitled to commence the action in Mr.
    Douglas’s name) rests on two key findings of fact: namely, that Mr. Douglas’s
    right of action vested in State Farm and crystallized prior to his bankruptcy, and
    that the Trustee disclaimed its interest in the cause of action. It argues that
    pursuant to s. 6(1)(a) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43</span></em> and <em>Landmark
    II Inc. v. 1535709 Ontario Ltd.</em>, 2011 ONCA 567, 283 O.A.C. 239, at para.
    18, no appeal lies to this court on those issues. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, State Farm says the Divisional Court
    correctly concluded that Mr. Douglas’s assignment in bankruptcy was subject to
    State Farm’s vested right to commence an action in his name. State Farm relies
    on <em>Central Mortgage &amp; Housing Corp. v. Dixon</em>, [1971] 2 W.W.R. 442
    (Q.B.), at paras. 15-20, 22, and 26-28, for the principle that a trustee
    acquires title to the bankrupt’s assets subject to all the equities existing at
    the date of bankruptcy and is bound by the terms of contracts the bankrupt
    entered into prior to bankruptcy. It argues that when Mr. Douglas made his
    assignment in bankruptcy, under the Homeowners Policy he had already granted
    State Farm the right to commence an action in his name. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, State Farm argues that the Divisional
    Court was correct to rely on ss. 40 and 67(1)(a) of the BIA. In its view, since
    any net proceeds recovered from the appellants would be held in trust for State
    Farm and, it submits, would not vest in the Trustee, it follows that the cause
    of action itself is held in trust for State Farm pursuant to s. 67(1)(a), is
    not divisible among Mr. Douglas’s creditors, and did not vest in the Trustee. In
    the alternative, the fact that any proceeds from the action would be held in
    trust for State Farm made the property “incapable of realization” in the hands
    of the Trustee, who was required to return it to Mr. Douglas pursuant to s. 40.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, and in the alternative, State Farm says
    that the subrogation clause in the Homeowners Policy amounted to an assignment
    of Mr. Douglas’s cause of action to State Farm and State Farm should be
    permitted to continue the action in its own name.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, State Farm seeks relief from this court
    not sought at first instance. It submits that if an assignment of the cause of
    action from the Trustee were required, its failure to obtain an assignment
    under s. 38 of the BIA is an irregularity, not a nullity, and therefore can be
    cured by an order transferring the cause in action to State Farm, <em>nunc pro
    tunc</em>.</span></p>
  <h1>A LEGAL OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given the technical nature of this appeal, I
    will provide an overview of the relevant aspects of the doctrine of subrogation
    and the applicable provisions of the BIA before turning to my analysis. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>(a) The
    Doctrine of Subrogation</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The common law doctrine of subrogation is one of
    the cornerstones of insurance law. The objectives of the doctrine are to ensure
    that (i) the insured receives no more and no less than a full indemnity, and
    (ii) the loss falls on the person who is legally responsible for causing it: <em>Somersall
    v. Friedman</em>, 2002 SCC 59, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 109, at para. 50.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The doctrine of subrogation is related to the
    principle of indemnity. It mandates that, having indemnified the insured for a
    loss caused by a third party, the insurer may bring an action against the third
    party in the insured’s name. The insurer is said to be subrogated to the
    insured’s rights and is entitled to exercise those rights in the name of the
    insured: <em>Zurich Insurance Co. v. Ison T.H. Auto Sales Inc.</em>, 2011 ONSC
    1870, 333 D.L.R. (4th) 696, at paras. 27 and 32, affirmed 2011 ONCA 663, 342 D.L.R.

    the following.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At common law, the insurer’s right of subrogation arises upon “full indemnification”
    of the insured.</p>

    contrary, the insurer’s right of subrogation does not arise until the insured
    has been fully indemnified. “Fully indemnified” means indemnified for both
    insured and uninsured losses, such as losses that exceed policy limits or
    losses that are not covered by the policy: <em>Somersall</em><i>, </i>at paras.
    34-36 and 53-54<i>; <em>Zurich </em></i><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(S.C.),</span></em> at paras. 27 and 32.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before the point of full indemnification, the
    insured is obligated to pursue any claim it has against the third party in good
    faith: <em>Somersall</em>, at para. 54; <em>Zurich</em> (S.C.), at para. 37. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, State Farm does not rely solely on
    its common law right of subrogation. It relies on the subrogation clause in the
    Homeowners Policy which permits State Farm to subrogate before its insured is
    fully indemnified.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The insured is in control of the litigation, or the <em>dominus litis</em>, until it has been fully indemnified for its insured and

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An entitlement to control the litigation does
    not follow by necessary implication from an insurer’s contractual right to be
    subrogated to the rights of the insured and to bring action in the name of the
    insured before the insured is fully indemnified: <em>Zurich</em> (S.C.), at
    para. 72. Put another way, the right of subrogation and the right to control
    the litigation may not necessarily be coincident rights.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subrogated claims are “derivative” in nature.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because the right of subrogation is derivative,
    the insurer can be in no better position as against the third party than the
    insured would be. Expressed otherwise, the insurer stands in the shoes of the
    insured. Any restriction or limit on the insured’s right of recovery against
    the third party applies equally to the insurer: <em>Matt (Litigation Guardian

  <h1>ANALYSIS</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>State Farm does not cross-appeal the Divisional
    Court’s finding that Wendy Douglas had no right of recovery for damages caused
    to the Douglases’ property. Therefore, the question raised on this appeal is
    whether State Farm was entitled to commence the action in Mr. Douglas’s name,
    and if not, whether State Farm may now regularize the action by continuing it
    in its own name. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>State Farm does not argue it was entitled to
    commence an action in the name of the Trustee, either under the Homeowner's
    Policy or, having fully indemnified the Trustee, as the Trustee's subrogee
    under the common law doctrine of subrogation, but it mistakenly commenced the
    action in the name of Mr. Douglas.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, given State Farm’s position, this
    appeal raises three broad issues:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had State Farm acquired a property interest in Mr. Douglas’s cause of
    action at the time that he made his assignment, such that the cause of action
    did not vest in the Trustee?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If not, did the subrogation clause in the Homeowners’ Policy permit
    State Farm to commence an action in the name of Mr. Douglas, who is an
    undischarged bankrupt?</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the answer to the first two questions is “no”, at this juncture, can
    the court make an order under ss. 38 or 40 of the BIA to remedy the procedural
    impediment to State Farm’s subrogated action? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I explain below, I conclude that: Mr.
    Douglas’s cause of action vested in the Trustee as at the date of his
    assignment into bankruptcy; the subrogation clause in the Homeowners’ Policy
    did not permit State Farm to commence the action in Mr. Douglas’s name; and, in
    the circumstances, the court cannot make an order under the BIA to remedy the
    procedural impediments to State Farm’s subrogated action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, a different conclusion would require
    an unprincipled disruption of established principles of bankruptcy law or a
    substantial change to the doctrine of subrogation. As the appellants submit,
    State Farm is a sophisticated party and could have included an assignment
    clause in the Homeowners’ Policy. It may also have been entitled to seek a
    timely order under s. 38 of the BIA, assigning the cause of action to it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Not having done so, State Farm could, and
    should, have commenced its subrogated action in the name of the Trustee, as
    trustee of the estate of Art Douglas, a bankrupt. The court invited
    supplemental written submissions from the parties on the question of whether, at
    this late juncture, the court could or should regularize State Farm’s
    subrogated action by </span>substituting the name of the Trustee, as trustee of
    the estate of Art Douglas, a bankrupt, for that of Art Douglas under r. 5.04(2)
    of the <em><span lang=EN-US>Rules of Civil Procedure</span></em>, effective
    upon the issuance of the statement of claim. Having considered those
    submissions, in my view, the court neither can nor should do so. State Farm did
    not seek this relief at either court below or at the hearing before this court,
    and this court does not have the benefit of full argument on the issue;
    ordering such relief would fall outside the proper institutional role of this
    court. I address this issue below, following my analysis of the three broad
    issues raised on this appeal.</p>

    proceeds of such litigation would constitute trust property in the possession
    of the Trustee, although not available for distribution to creditors, pursuant

    it stands for the principle that a subrogated claim brought by an insurer is
    not caught by a bankruptcy. In my view, the broad principle enunciated in <em>Mariner</em><i> </i>conflates the concepts of subrogation and assignment and is incorrect in

    should be construed in favour of the insured: <em>Somersall</em>, at para. 47. There

lang=EN-US>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, State Farm is a sophisticated insurer.
    It would have been a simple matter for it to include an assignment clause in
    the Homeowners Policy if it indeed intended that Mr. Douglas assign his cause
    of action to it. State Farm does not argue that an assignment provision should
    be implied and there is no basis to imply such a provision.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7>       (c)  The
    Trustee’s Disclaimer </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, I agree with the appellants that the
    Trustee did not disclaim its interest in the cause of action through the
    Disclaimer. As the appellants argue, the scope of the Disclaimer was limited to
    “insurance claims … for loss or damage in the oil spill to matrimonial
    household contents not affixed or enjoyed with the residential property or
    proceeds of personal property exempt under the <em>Execution Act </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(Ontario)</span></em> which would not vest in their
    Trustee in Bankruptcy”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Disclaimer is twice removed from an
    assignment of the cause of action to State Farm: (1) it disclaims insurance
    claims by the Douglases against State Farm, not tort claims by the Douglases
    against the appellants; (2) it is limited to matrimonial household contents and
    personal property exempt from seizure. In my view, the Disclaimer operated as
    no more than a signal from the Trustee to State Farm that insurance proceeds
    for damage to excluded property could be paid out directly to the Douglases.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I therefore conclude that at the time Mr.
    Douglas made his assignment in bankruptcy, State Farm had not acquired any
    proprietary interest in the cause of action; Mr. Douglas had not assigned his
    cause of action to State Farm; and the Trustee had not disclaimed its interest
    in the cause of action by executing the Disclaimer. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Douglas’s cause of action was “property” that

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>State Farm seeks to characterize the holding of
    the Divisional Court that Mr. Douglas’s cause of action against the appellants had
    vested in State Farm prior to his bankruptcy as a finding of fact that is immune
    from review by this court. I do not agree that this is what they found. If that
    were indeed the proper characterization of their findings, then, as I have
    said, they are founded on incorrect legal principles. However, in my view, the
    Divisional Court concluded something different, namely that Mr. Douglas’s cause
    of action passed to the Trustee when he made his assignment in bankruptcy, but
    did so subject to State Farm’s right to bring an action in Mr. Douglas’s name. I
    turn next to that issue.</span></p>
  <h3 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>2.  The subrogation clause in the Homeowners’ Policy did not permit
    State Farm to commence an action in the name of Mr. Douglas</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court held, at para. 30, that Mr.
    Douglas’s “right to recover against the appellants vested in his Trustee …
    subject to State Farm’s vested right to assume it and State Farm’s vested right
    to commence an action in Mr. Douglas’s name to enforce it.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In support of this conclusion, State Farm argues
    that a trustee acquires title to the bankrupt’s assets subject to all the
    equities existing at the date of bankruptcy and accordingly can only acquire
    those interests and rights that are available to the bankrupt prior to
    bankruptcy. In <em>Grobstein v. Kouri</em>, [1936] S.C.R. 264, a dispute arose
    between a trustee and a third party over the proceeds of a life insurance
    policy. Justice Rinfret, writing for the majority, stated at para. 23:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Now, under <em>The Bankruptcy Act</em><i>, </i>a trustee takes
    the property of the debtor only subject to all the rights and equity to which
    it was subject while it was held by the debtor. The Trustee is the legal
    representative of the debtor; and generally speaking succeeds only to such
    rights as the debtor himself would have had, if not bankrupt, and no other
    rights. There are, of course, exceptions to that principle, whereby the trustee
    is vested for the benefit of the creditors with certain additional rights not
    available to the bankrupt debtor; but this is not a case where these exceptions
    come in.</p>

    Farm was entitled to commence the action in the Trustee’s name<i>. </i>This
    conclusion gives effect to both the objectives and principles of the doctrine
    of subrogation and established principles of bankruptcy law. The doctrine of
    subrogation is rooted in the principle of indemnity and State Farm indemnified
    the Trustee for Mr. Douglas’s loss; under bankruptcy law, the Trustee, and not
    Mr. Douglas, had the capacity to commence the action; and under the doctrine of
    subrogation, upon becoming the <em>dominus litus</em><i>, </i>State Farm (and
    not the Trustee) was entitled to control the litigation. Upon bankruptcy, it
    makes sense to read the subrogation clause in an insurance policy as if the
    trustee’s name appears in place of that of the bankrupt insured, just as is

    re-vesting Mr. Douglas’s action in him, effective before State Farm commenced
    the action in his name. In any event, assuming that this cause of action could

    order under s. 40(2) cannot normalize these proceedings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> First, an order under s. 40(2) re-conveying a
    cause of action to an undischarged bankrupt does not provide the bankrupt with
    capacity to commence the claim: <em>Stefaniak</em>, paras. 27 and 28. To
    normalize this cause of action, State Farm would require an order under s.
    40(2) effective on January 6, 2010, which is the day before it commenced the
    action in Mr. Douglas’s name. But Mr. Douglas did not receive an absolute
    discharge from bankruptcy until March 5, 2010. Although the court can vary a
    bankrupt’s date of discharge in certain circumstances, it cannot do so here. Therefore,
    it cannot grant an order under s. 40(2) re-conveying this cause of action to
    Mr. Douglas, effective January 6, 2010. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In <em>Stefaniak</em>, the motion judge purported to grant an order
    under s. 40(2), conveying an interest in a lawsuit to the bankrupt effective
    from the date he commenced his claim, even though he was an undischarged
    bankrupt. This court cautioned, at para. 31, that commencing proceedings before
    the bankrupt has obtained an order of absolute discharge “will ordinarily be
    fatal.” However, having regard to what it described as the “unusual
    circumstances” of the case, this court varied the order of discharge pursuant
    to s. 187(5) of the BIA, by dating the discharge the day before the bankrupt
    commenced the action, thereby justifying the order granted under s. 40(2) by
    the motion judge. Section 187(5) of the BIA provides that “[e]very court may
    review, rescind or vary any order made by it under its bankruptcy
    jurisdiction.” </span></p>

    discharge before commencing the action. It was undisputed that before he
    commenced the action he had satisfied all the conditions of the conditional
    order and had “every reason to believe” that he had been discharged from
    bankruptcy. The order had been prepared, and all that remained was for the
    order to be “stamped and issued”. The only thing that stood between him and
    absolute discharge was administrative delay and backlog in the bankruptcy court
    office.</span></p>

    appears to have obtained an automatic discharge on the expiry of 9 months after
    the date of bankruptcy under s. 168.1(1) of the BIA. The basis on which this
    court might vary his date of discharge under s. 187(5) of the BIA is not

    no authority to make a <em>nunc pro tunc</em> order if the party did not seek
    such an order before the relevant limitation period expired. It is important to
    note that the Supreme Court cited <em>Montego Forest Products Ltd., (Re)</em><i> </i>(1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 651 (C.A.), as an example where an order under the BIA
    (in that case an order pursuant to s. 38) was properly granted on a <em>nunc

lang=EN-US>On this appeal, State Farm requests alternate relief. If the court
    finds that State Farm had no right to commence the claim in Mr. Douglas’s name because
    of his bankruptcy, it requests an order under s. 38 of the BIA assigning the
    cause of action to State Farm on a <em>nunc pro tunc</em> basis. Although State
    Farm did not file and serve a notice of cross-appeal, as required by r. 61.07(1)
    of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><i>,</i> R.R.O. 1990, Reg.194, I
    nonetheless consider its request for alternate relief.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellants that such an order cannot be granted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>State Farm did not comply with the procedure required by s. 38. It did
    not request the Trustee to take a proceeding against the appellants and did not
    bring a motion for an order authorizing State Farm to take the proceeding in its
    own name and at its expense and risk. Most significantly, the Trustee is not a
    party to this action. Indeed, there is no indication that the Trustee, who is
    now discharged, was even given notice that State Farm would seek an order against
    the Trustee on appeal under s. 38 of the BIA.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In their Supplementary Factum, the appellants also argue that a
    subrogated insurer is not a “creditor” of its bankrupt insured’s estate within
    the meaning of s. 1 of the BIA, and therefore is not entitled to an order under
    s. 38. While raised, this point was not argued. Indeed, in further written
    submissions invited after the appeal was heard, they submit (albeit without
    reference to s. 38) that State Farm could and should have sought an assignment
    from the Trustee before commencing its subrogated action. I leave whether a
    subrogated insurer is a “creditor” for another day. I only note that, in light
    of <em>Ramgotra</em><i>, </i>which held that property of a bankrupt not
    divisible among his creditors becomes part of the bankrupt’s estate, and the effective
    inability of a trustee to return property to a bankrupt under s. 40(2) of the BIA
    before the bankrupt’s discharge, a narrow interpretation of “creditor” might
    create practical difficulties in the administration of a bankrupt’s estate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, unlike the situation in <em>Montego Forest Products</em>,
    no request for an order pursuant to s. 38 was sought before the limitation
    period had expired. In fact, the first request for such an order was made
    almost seven years after the limitation period had expired. As a result, in the
    circumstances, <em>Green</em> also prevents this court from granting a <em>nunc
    pro tunc</em> order under s. 38 of the BIA.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>While my conclusion that an order under s. 38 is not available to
    State Farm in these circumstances does not turn on <em>Green</em><i>, </i>I
    agree with the appellants that s. 21(2) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em><i> </i>would not assist State Farm in overcoming the hurdle it presents. That
    section<i> </i>permits a claim to be amended after the expiry of a limitation
    period to correct a “misnaming or misdescription of a party”.<i> </i>The
    suggestion is that an order assigning the cause of action to State Farm,
    combined with an order under r. 5.04(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> granting
    leave to amend the statement of claim to name State Farm as plaintiff, would
    normalize these proceedings. Rule 5.04(2) provides as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) Adding, deleting or substituting parties – At any stage of
    a proceeding the court may by order add, delete or substitute a party or
    correct the name of a party incorrectly named, on such terms as are just,

    adjournment.</p>

lang=EN-US>In my view, while the test for misnomer may be broad enough to embrace

    This is because, as I have explained above, at the time State Farm chose to
    commence a claim, it did not have capacity to do so in its own name. As a
    result, it cannot be said that State Farm made a “mistake” in naming the
    Douglases as plaintiffs instead of itself. </span></p>

    naming of the Douglases as plaintiffs instead of State Farm was not a
    “misnaming or misdescription” of a party. Section 21(2) of the <em>Limitations

lang=EN-US>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In its written submissions, State Farm maintains its assertion that
    Mr. Douglas’s cause of action did not vest in the Trustee. However, if this
    court were to determine that the action could and should have been commenced in
    the name of the Trustee, then, in the alternative, it argues that its failure
    to commence its subrogated action in the name of the Trustee was a misnomer,
    and seeks an order under r. 5.04(2) permitting it to amend the style of cause,
    effective upon the issuance of the statement of claim, by substituting the
    Trustee’s name for that of Mr. Douglas.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>State Farm also argues that its notice of motion cites r. 5.04 and
    contains a “basket clause”, requesting “[s]uch further and other relief as this
    Honourable Court deems appropriate”. It says that this entitled the motion
    judge to grant an order under r. 5.04 amending the style of cause, effective
    upon the issuance of the statement of claim, by substituting the Trustee’s name
    for that of Mr. Douglas. It further argues that ss. 134(1) and 134(5) of the <em>Courts
    of Justice Act</em>, in turn, permit this court to do so, even though it did
    not properly cross-appeal the motion judge’s or the Divisional Court’s orders. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    requesting an order substituting the name of the Trustee for that of Mr.

    then State Farm seeks leave to cross-appeal under r. 61.07(3). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State Farm argues
    that if Mr. Douglas’s cause of action vested in the Trustee, State Farm’s
    failure to commence the action in the Trustee’s name is simply a technical
    deficiency that has no impact on the substance of its subrogated action against
    the appellants, and therefore is a “misnomer”, and that it would be appropriate
    and equitable in the circumstances to permit the amendment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It further
    argues that the Trustee’s discharge is not an impediment to this relief: s.
    41(10) of the BIA provides that “[n]otwithstanding his discharge, the trustee
    remains the trustee of the estate for the performance of such duties as may be
    incidental to the full administration of the estate”. It submits that acting as
    the nominal plaintiff would be an “incidental duty” of the Trustee within the
    meaning of s. 41(10) and, therefore, that it would not be necessary to
    re-appoint the Trustee to grant the order, <em>nunc pro tunc</em>, under r.
    5.04(2).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not
    persuaded by State Farm’s submissions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, even
    if State Farm’s naming of Art Douglas as the plaintiff could be considered a
    “misnomer” and s. 41(10) of the BIA would permit the court to amend the style
    of cause after the Trustee’s discharge to substitute the name of the Trustee,
    as trustee of the estate of Art Douglas, a bankrupt, for that of Mr. Douglas,
    the court cannot, or if it can should not, grant this relief at this juncture.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, an order
    under r. 5.04(2) substituting the name of the Trustee for that of Mr. Douglas,
    effective upon the issuance of the statement of claim, was not an order that
    ought to or could have been made by the motion judge, and therefore is not an
    order that this court can make under s. 134(1)(a). While State Farm referenced
    r. 5.04 in its notice of motion, it did so because it sought an alternative order
    to amend the statement of claim to correct the name of the plaintiff to read
    “Art Douglas and Wendy Douglas by their subrogee State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty
    Company”. The relief now sought was not argued before the motion judge, and it
    would not have been open to him to grant it: <em><span lang=EN-US>Saadati v.
    Moorhead</span></em><i>, </i>2017 SCC 28, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 543, at para. 9,
    citing <em><span lang=EN-US>Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Renard</span></em><i>, </i>2008 BCCA 343, 298 D.L.R. (4th) 216, at paras. 38-39. The inclusion of a
    “basket clause” in a notice of motion is not a basis for a motion judge to
    grant relief that was not sought by the moving party, on a basis not argued by
    it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, such an
    order would not be “just” in the circumstances, and thus this court cannot and
    should not grant such relief under s. 134(1)(c). Section 134(1)(c) is broader
    than s. 134(1)(a), and permits the court to make any order that it considers
    “just”. But this is not a case in which the court can or should permit a
    cross-appeal or exercise its inherent jurisdiction to grant an order <em>nunc
    pro tunc</em>. There are a number of reasons for this.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is not appropriate for an appellate court, twice removed from
    the parties’ initiating motion, to grant this relief. It does not lie within
    the proper institutional role of this court to act as a lawyer for a party who
    erred in naming the correct plaintiff. It would be inappropriate in these
    circumstances to suggest and then grant relief unsought by the parties. State
    Farm only proposes to substitute the name of the Trustee for that of Mr.
    Douglas, in the alternative, in response to a request from the court for
    further submissions on the issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relatedly, while the appellants were provided the opportunity to deliver
    brief written submissions, they have not had the opportunity to make full
    submissions on this new issue. They have incurred substantial legal expenses
    over more than four years in responding to State Farm’s flawed legal position
    that it was entitled to commence its subrogated action in the name of Art
    Douglas. It would be unfair to resolve this appeal against them on an issue
    never raised below.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “irregularity” that State Farm seeks to correct was intentional.
    State Farm chose to commence its subrogated action in Mr. Douglas’s name, knowing
    that Mr. Douglas had filed an assignment in bankruptcy, and continues to assert
    that it was entitled to do so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The request for this alternative relief is made more than four years
    after the appellants brought their summary judgment motion and State Farm
    brought its cross-motion. The delay is entirely attributable to State Farm. The
    defendants are entitled to a degree of certainty and finality.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if this court were to grant such relief, the pleadings would be
    deficient and unable to support an ongoing action by the Trustee without
    further amendments. The statement of claim does not plead that Mr. Douglas’s
    interest in the property or his cause of action vested in the Trustee. Instead,
    it pleads that Mr. Douglas was an owner of the property at all material times.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State Farm is a sophisticated party. It has previously drawn
    distinctions and shown an understanding of the nuances between claims that vest
    in a trustee in bankruptcy and those which remain in the hands of the bankrupt: <em>Future Health Inc. (Trustee of) v. State </em><em><span style='font-size:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We have had the benefit of reading our colleague’s careful and
    thorough reasons. We agree with the legal analysis and basis for concluding
    that the dismissal of the appellants’ motion should be set aside. We do not,
    however, agree that this court should substitute a dismissal of the claim. In
    our view, the appropriate result is to remit the matter back to the Superior
    Court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, we have concluded that it should remain
    open to State Farm to pursue the issue as to whether its subrogated action
    should be regularized by substituting the Trustee, as trustee of the estate of
    Art Douglas, a bankrupt, as plaintiff. While we agree that this court should
    not make that order because it was not an issue determined by the courts below
    and we lack a full argument on it, the justice of the case requires this court
    to remit the issue back to first instance for determination.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In our view, the effective issue for determination at the original
    motion was the name in which the claim ought to be brought. While arguing that
    it was entitled to commence an action in the Douglases’ name, State Farm sought
    directions from the court and submitted that, if the Douglases were not the
    proper plaintiffs, its name should be substituted for theirs as plaintiff. The
    appellants maintained that the Douglases had no capacity to start or continue
    the action in their own names and took the position that, although an action
    may have been commenced by the Douglases’ Trustee, the applicable limitation
    period expired over four years ago and, for that reason, it was not possible to
    simply amend the claim and add the Trustee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge made it clear that an equitable result should
    prevail and that he would draw on his inherent jurisdiction, including ss. 96
    and 97 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, to ensure
    that it did. In the unusual circumstances presented by this case, the motion
    judge unfortunately adopted an incorrect approach to achieving the equitable
    result.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For its part, the Divisional Court also sought to achieve an
    equitable result. It correctly found that State Farm had the right to bring the
    claim in the name of the insured but erred in not finding that, for the
    property damage claim, the Trustee was the insured in whose name the action had
    to be brought.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The errors in the courts below are understandable. State Farm’s
    uncontested right is to bring a subrogated action to recover its remediation
    costs from the appellants. In whose name the claim is to be brought when a
    bankruptcy intervenes is a somewhat novel issue. The parties were unable to
    find any specific guidance from the courts on this issue. State Farm determined
    that it should bring the action in the name of the originally named insured and
    it did so within the limitation period. The courts below confirmed, albeit in
    error, that this was the proper procedure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Our colleague correctly explains that the proper procedure required
    State Farm to bring the action in the name of the Trustee and not the
    Douglases. Relying on the cases of <em>Saadati v. Moorhead</em>, 2017 SCC 28,
    [2017] 1 S.C.R. 543, and <em>Canada Trust Co. Mortgage Co. v. Renard</em>, 2008
    BCCA 343, 298 D.L.R. (4th) 216, our colleague argues, however, that it would be
    unfair to the appellants to grant relief not sought or argued before the motion
    judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>This is the point at which we disagree. In our view, those decisions
    have no application to the present case. They involve the appropriateness of a
    court granting relief that was neither pleaded nor sought at trial. In the
    present case, we are dealing with the appropriateness of granting relief on a
    motion heard prior to trial. Granting relief on appeal or following the
    remitting of the motion for a new hearing does not raise the same issues. This
    is particularly so in circumstances such as existed here where the motion judge
    had before him the appellants’ motion to dismiss the claim and State Farm’s
    cross-motion seeking directions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In the present case, the equities clearly favour State Farm, and the
    appellants would suffer no non-compensable prejudice should the misnomer issue
    be considered and resolved prior to trial either on appeal or by way of a fresh
    motion. State Farm’s right to bring a subrogated action to recover its
    remediation costs from the appellants is uncontested. State Farm clearly
    intended to exercise its contractual rights to bring the action “in the name of
    the insured”. State Farm’s erroneous view (a view shared by the motion judge
    and the Divisional Court) that the insured for purposes of the claim were the
    Douglases and not their Trustee arguably constitutes a misnomer that is a
    procedural irregularity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>There can be no dispute that the appellants understood that the
    action commenced in January 2010 was a subrogated action brought in the name of
    the insured under the Policy which responded to the claimed loss. No party was
    mistaken about what this action was about. The appellants have known since at
    least March 2008 that State Farm was expending substantial amounts to remediate
    the Douglases’ property and that State Farm intended to claim its remediation
    costs from the appellants pursuant to its contractual right of subrogation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellants did not learn about the bankruptcy of Mr. Douglas
    until January 2012 upon receipt of the Douglases’ affidavit of documents, which
    contained documents related to their bankruptcy. In February 2012, they
    conducted an examination for discovery of State Farm’s representative. They
    raised the issue of the Douglases’ capacity to commence their action in the
    fall of 2012 and January 2013; however, the appellants did not bring their
    motion to dismiss the Douglases’ action or amend their statement of defence to
    allege their incapacity until October 2013. While the appellants were entitled
    to raise the issue of the Douglases’ capacity at any stage of the litigation,
    including at trial, their delay in putting forward this issue works against any
    suggestion that they would be prejudiced if the action were continued in the
    Trustee’s name.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>State Farm should be given the opportunity to argue misnomer. State
    Farm fulfilled all of its obligations under the Policy. It immediately
    responded to the Douglases’ claim. It provided funding for Mr. Douglas’s
    personal expenses. It thoroughly remediated the property. There is no evidence
    that State Farm did anything but act in good faith, just as consumers trust all
    insurers will. And State Farm commenced the subrogated action within the
    two-year limitation period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In our view, to foreclose State Farm in this appeal from having the
    misnomer issue determined would potentially grant a windfall to the appellants
    and be contrary to the well-established principle underlying subrogation as
    articulated in <em>Somersall v. Friedman</em>, 2002 SCC 59, [2002] 3 S.C.R.
    109, at para. 50, that “the loss falls on the person who is legally responsible
    for causing it”.</span></p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As a result, we would set aside the dismissal of the appellants’ motion
    and remit the matter to the Superior Court to permit State Farm to seek to
    regularize its subrogated action by bringing a motion under rr. 5.04 and 26.01
    to substitute the Trustee, as trustee of the estate of Art Douglas, a bankrupt,
    as plaintiff, and to amend the pleadings as necessary to reflect the Douglases’
    bankruptcy.  We would direct that the Trustee be served with the motion
    materials.  In the event that State Farm does not serve this motion within 90
    days of the release of these reasons, or if State Farm is ultimately
    unsuccessful in that motion, including any appeal, the action will be
    dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>With respect to costs, the appellants prevailed on the appeal and
    are entitled to their costs in accordance with our colleague’s disposition of
    them.</span></p>

    Homeowners Policy in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>Section 143(1) of the Act defines the

    of fire is an incidental peril to the coverage provided;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>The Homeowners Policy is a
    comprehensive general liability policy, and “fire” is one of the many insured
    perils. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that comprehensive insurance
    policies like the Homeowners Policy do not qualify as “contracts of fire
    insurance” under British Columbia’s <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c.
    226: <i>KP Pacific Holdings Ltd. v. Guardian Insurance Co. of Canada</i>, 2003
    SCC 25, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 433. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>Lower courts in Ontario, applying <i>KP
    Pacific</i>, have determined that Part IV of Ontario’s Act does not apply to
    multi-peril policies: <i>Boyce v. Co-operators General Insurance Co.</i>, 2012
    ONSC 6381, rev’d on other grounds, 2013 ONCA 298; <i>Dumitrascu v. State Farm
    Fire and Casualty Co.</i>, 2014 ONSC 2224. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court
    of Appeal similarly held that the <i>Fire Insurance Act</i>, R.S.N.L. 1990, c.
    F-10 did not apply to comprehensive policies: <i>Co-operators General Insurance
    Co. v. Burry</i>, 2007 NLCA 52. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, courts in New
    Brunswick and Manitoba have distinguished <i>KP Pacific</i>, and have concluded
    that comprehensive policies are included in the “Fire Insurance” sections of
    their province’s insurance acts: <i>Thomas v. Aviva Insurance Co.</i>, 2011
    NBCA 96; <i>Casey v. Federated Insurance</i>, 2004 MBQB 99.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>Denis Boivin, in <i>Insurance Law</i>,

    to comprehensive policies has not been determined by this court. The issue was
    not argued by the parties and, because the subrogation clause in the Homeowners
    Policy permitted State Farm to subrogate before the Douglases were fully
    indemnified, it is unnecessary to determine it.</span></p>

    the subrogation relationship as one of trust, concluding that an insurer’s

    commentary to the effect that it has resulted in practical difficulties. Roderick
    Wood and David Bryan, in “Creeping Statutory Obsolescence in Bankruptcy Law,”
    IIC Art. Vol. 3-1 (Thomson Reuters Canada Ltd, 2014), at p. 12 suggest that the
    statutory framework within which <i>Ramgotra</i> was decided has changed, and
    that trustees in bankruptcy are not in fact applying the conceptual framework
    developed in that case. They state,</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>The practical reality is that
    trustees in bankruptcy do not convey trust property and exempt property back to
    the bankrupt. They treat the property as not ever having vested in the
    bankrupt’s estate. The difficulty, of course, is that the bankrupt has no power
    to dispose or otherwise deal with the property until the property has been
    transferred back to the bankrupt.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>They suggest that Parliament should amend the BIA to
    either provide that non-divisible assets do not vest in the trustee in
    bankruptcy, or else set out a specific procedure as has been done in the United
    States to withdraw exempt property from the bankrupt estate.</p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> In <i>Luckevich v. Ivany</i>, 2018 ONCA 144, a bankrupt appealed a motion
    judge’s dismissal of his motion seeking leave to commence third party claims
    for contribution and indemnity. In the course of his hearing before the motion
    judge, the bankrupt raised s. 37 of the BIA. In reasons released while this
    judgment was under reserve, this court held that the motion judge erred in dismissing
    the bankrupt’s motion without permitting the bankrupt to seek relief, or making
    clear the bankrupt remained entitled to seek relief, under s. 37 of the BIA.
    Section 37 permits a bankrupt or creditor who is aggrieved by any act or
    decision of the trustee to apply to the court to “reverse or modify the act or
    decision complained of” and make such order as it thinks just. Insofar as <i>Luckevich </i>may suggest that an undischarged bankrupt can obtain an order under s. 37
    of the BIA granting leave to issue third party claims in the bankrupt’s name, I
    would overrule it. In that case, the order available to the bankrupt would be
    one that reverses the trustee’s decision not to pursue the third party claims
    and orders the trustee to do so. See, for example, <i>Brown v. Royal Bank of
    Canada</i>, 2001 ABCA 73, 277 A.R. 241.</p>
