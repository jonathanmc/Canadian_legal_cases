  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted on one count each of
    sexual interference, sexual exploitation, and sexual assault following a jury
    trial. The offences arose out of two incidents involving the appellant’s
    stepdaughter. The first was alleged to have occurred when the complainant was
    13 years old; the second approximately 18 months later. The complainant was 18
    years old at the time of trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the first incident, the complainant alleged
    that, while laying on her bed, the appellant put his hand underneath her pajama
    bottom and touched, but did not penetrate, her vagina. Nothing more was said or
    done. The complainant testified that she could not tell if the appellant was
    awake when this touching happened. The appellant testified and denied that the
    incident occurred, but acknowledged that he had once fallen asleep on the
    complainant’s bed. The defence motion for a directed verdict in relation to
    this incident was unsuccessful. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the second incident, the complainant alleged
    that the appellant touched her torso while he was in her bed, told her that he
    had a crush on her, explained sex to her and informed her of his sexual
    prowess. He offered to have sex with her, but told her that he would respect
    her if she said no. The complainant declined his offer and ran from her
    bedroom. The appellant testified that he was in the complainant’s bedroom on the
    night in question to confront her about hard core pornography that he found on
    her computer earlier that day, and touched her only to see if she was awake.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sole issue on appeal is the judge’s charge
    to the jury. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred 1) in failing to
    instruct the jury that evidence concerning one incident could not be used to
    support a finding of guilt in the other incident; 2) in instructing the jury on
    the requirements of </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R. v. W. (D.)</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742; and 3) in failing to address important
    inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, the trial judge erred in failing to
    instruct the jury that evidence concerning one incident could not be used to
    support a finding of guilt on a charge relating to the other incident. The jury
    charge was both deficient and confusing in respect of this issue, and as a
    result the conviction cannot stand.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>The jury charge</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The indictment included three counts and the two
    incidents were relevant to each count. The Crown did not make a similar fact
    application in respect of the two incidents. Thus, the Crown had to prove each
    incident separately.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge understood the importance of
    separating the incidents in his instructions and discussed the matter with the
    parties at length prior to completing his charge. However, his instructions
    dealt with the need to treat the counts separately rather than treat the
    incidents separately. The trial judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The indictment on which you are trying S.A.
    alleges that he committed three specific offences. Each allegation is a
    separate charge. You must make a separate decision and give a separate verdict
    for each charge. The verdicts may but do not have to be the same on each
    charge. You must make your decision on each charge only on the basis of the
    evidence that relates to that charge in the legal principles that I tell you
    apply to make your decisions on that charge. You must not use evidence that
    relates only to one charge in making your decision on any other charge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although it is correct to say that each count in
    the indictment had to be decided separately based on the evidence related to
    that count, each count in the indictment included the two incidents, and these
    were not to be treated as similar fact incidents. The jury should have been instructed
    that each incident had to be proven separately, and that evidence concerning
    one incident could not be used to support a finding relating to the other
    incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We cannot accept the Crown’s submission that the
    looseness of the language – the use of the term “charge” rather than “incident”
    – is of no effect. Given the circumstances of this case – unrelated incidents included
    in the same counts – the language of the instruction is confusing. In these
    circumstances “charge” must mean “count”, because the trial judge instructed
    the jury that three separate decisions were required, and there were only two
    incidents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown submits that, read as a whole, the
    trial judge’s instructions would have been understood by the jury. We do not
    agree. Although the trial judge related the incidents to the charges later in
    his instructions, in our view, the failure to clearly separate the incidents
    for purposes of the required analysis gave rise to the risk that the jury would
    engage in propensity reasoning – that it would conclude that the appellant was surely
    guilty of one offence because of the unlikelihood of his having also been
    charged with another. In the circumstances of this case, where each charge
    concerned two incidents and the Crown conceded that one incident could not be
    used as similar fact evidence in relation to the other, the jury had to be
    informed not to use the evidence concerning one incident to support a finding relating
    to the other incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The failure of the appellant’s trial counsel to
    object to the charge is a relevant consideration, but it is not determinative. It
    was incumbent on the trial judge to properly instruct the jury on the need to
    separate the two incidents, regardless of counsel’s failure to object: </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>R. v. Brown</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, 2007 ONCA 71, 221 O.A.C.
    17, at para. 16.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of our conclusion on this ground, it is
    unnecessary to address the other grounds of appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal from conviction is allowed, and a new

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown concedes that the complainant did not
    meet the definition of a young person under s. 153(2) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-US> and that the charge of
    sexual exploitation should not have been left with the jury. Accordingly, an
    acquittal is entered on this count. </span></p>
