  <p class=Endorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The appellant husband
    appeals from an order, dated February 22, 2017, (the “February 2017 order”) under
    which the motion judge:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-US>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>struck a reply factum filed by the husband; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-US>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>rectified an overpayment of trust funds to the
    respondent wife by applying the overpayment to an underpayment of support
    payments; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-US>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>struck the husband's pleadings for failure to
    obey court orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>The husband was
    self-represented on the motions that led to the February 2017 order, which were
    heard on February 1, 2017. The wife had counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In addition to the above
    orders, at the motion hearing, the motion judge refused to permit the husband
    to lead oral evidence from his accountant because the husband had not complied
    with a condition in a December 22, 2016 order (the “December 2016 order”)
    permitting him to lead such evidence. The condition required the husband’s accountant
    to send a letter to the wife’s counsel outlining his intended evidence by
    January 20, 2017. However, although the requirement to send the letter to the
    wife’s counsel was included in the formal order entered on January 30, 2017 and
    was mentioned on one occasion during the oral hearing at which it was made, it
    was not included in the handwritten endorsement of the December 2016 order, on
    which the husband relied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Both parties were represented on
    appeal. At the appeal hearing, counsel agreed that, in fact, there was no
    overpayment of trust funds as described in para. 2 of the February 2017 order
    and also agreed that para. 2 of that order should be set aside in its entirety on
    consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In our view, the appeal from that
    part of the February 2017 order striking the husband’s pleadings must be
    allowed for three reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, the appellant was denied
    the opportunity to respond fully to the wife’s motion to strike. Second, the
    motion judge overstated the wife’s efforts to move the case on to trial. Third,
    in the context of not having a full picture of the husband’s position, the
    motion judge failed to properly consider whether any lesser remedy would
    suffice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Before turning to these reasons,
    we will briefly review some of the background leading up to the February 2017 order.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties were married in 1996 and separated
    in 2007. They have three children, ranging in age from 15 to 20. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The wife commenced a divorce proceeding in
    February 2008. Since that date, multiple motions have resulted in numerous
    court orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Among other things, the parties' farm property,
    which was held in the name of a corporation, has been sold. The wife’s counsel
    is holding the net proceeds of sale (originally $440,600.41) in trust, subject
    to an order to pay child and spousal support to the wife from the net proceeds<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[1]</span></span></span></a> with the payments to be
    credited against the husband’s interest in such proceeds. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties’ house and associated 3.8 acres of
    land has also been sold; the husband’s counsel is holding the net proceeds of
    sale ($265,111.72) in trust.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following a settlement conference in January
    2014, the wife obtained a final order for custody of the parties' children. No
    access to the children was ordered for the husband. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This proceeding first came on for trial in
    September 2015. With the consent of the wife’s counsel, the trial did not
    proceed – the husband could not attend because he was in jail in the United
    States. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The matter next came on for trial at a September
    6, 2016 sitting of the Superior Court in Sarnia. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 7, 2016, the wife brought a motion
    returnable September 12, 2016 to adjourn the trial and for disclosure from the
    husband. The motion judge adjourned the trial to November 7, 2016 and ordered
    the husband to produce the following items within 30 days, failing which the
    wife could move to strike his pleadings (the “September 2016 disclosure order”):</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-US>-       income tax returns and notices of assessment for 2010 to
    2015, subject to the proviso that the notices of assessment would not be
    available within 30 days;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-US>-      a statement of year-to-date gross earnings from all income
    sources in 2016;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-US>-      an up-dated financial statement; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-US>-      a net family property statement and brief of supporting
    documents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 12, 14, and 20, 2016, the husband’s
    counsel sent correspondence to the wife’s counsel in which she explained that
    the husband's accountant (who was also the accountant for the corporation that
    owned the farm) required certain information about the trust funds held by the
    wife's counsel to complete tax returns for the husband and the corporation. She
    also explained that she could not complete the husband’s financial statement
    for the same reason. In that correspondence, the husband’s counsel also purported
    to forward date of marriage financial information and draft financial
    statements for the corporation. Counsel's October 12, 2016 correspondence
    enclosed a letter from the husband's accountant questioning certain payments
    made to the wife from the trust account held by the wife's counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 4, 2016, the wife's counsel sent a
    letter to the husband's counsel explaining that, as a result of an error, the
    wife had been overpaid $53,996.19 from the net proceeds of sale of the farm. The
    wife’s counsel proposed that the overpayment be rectified by treating the
    support payments as being in arrears – because they were being paid from joint
    funds – and by applying the overpayment to outstanding arrears. The wife’s
    counsel also moved on October 25, 2016 to adjourn the November 7, 2016 trial
    date by motion returnable that day. The supporting affidavit indicated counsel
    had agreed to the adjournment. The husband subsequently discharged his counsel
    due to lack of funds. Nonetheless, the trial scheduled for November 7, 2016 was
    adjourned on consent to a date to be fixed by the trial coordinator. The trial
    was to be scheduled as soon as practicable but taking account of the fact that
    the husband had not yet complied with the September 2016 disclosure order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 18, 2016, the husband brought a
    motion returnable November 24, 2016, requesting a full accounting from the
    wife's counsel of the proceeds of sale of the farm property and seeking damages
    from the wife’s counsel for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud. The husband
    attached to his affidavit certain documents that he did not identify in his
    affidavit but which purport, on their face, to be copies of proposed personal
    and corporate tax returns and corporate financial statements for years that
    include 2010 to 2015. In addition, he attached a letter, dated November 14,
    2016, from his accountant to the wife’s counsel, purporting to enclose the
    husband’s personal tax returns for 2007 to 2015 and corporate financial
    statements and tax returns for the same period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In response to the husband's affidavit, the
    bookkeeper/accountant for the wife's counsel delivered an affidavit in which
    she explained that she had mistakenly paid $53,996.19 to the wife from the
    trust funds being held by the wife's counsel as a result of confusion about the
    terms of certain court orders for the release of funds. She also asserted that,
    unless an adjustment was made, the wife was effectively paying support to
    herself because the ongoing support payments were being deducted from joint
    funds. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 22, 2016, the wife brought a motion
    returnable on December 8, 2016 seeking, among other things, an order striking
    the husband's pleadings for failing to comply with various court orders (the
    September 2016 disclosure order and prior orders, dated January 30, 2014, June
    14, 2012, August 25, 2011, and August 30, 2012, under which the husband had
    been ordered to: provide information concerning his attempts to obtain
    employment and the terms of the employment he had obtained; answer undertakings;
    and provide evidence that he was maintaining certain insurance policies in
    place). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the same motion, the wife also asked for an
    order rectifying the overpayment of support of $53,996.19 by setting it off
    against support payments of $77,371.10, which she asserted had been paid from
    her share of the funds held in trust.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On December 12, 2016, the husband brought a
    motion returnable December 15, 2016 seeking a payout of $50,000 from the
    proceeds of sale of the farm property held in trust by the wife's counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On December 15, 2016, the husband brought a
    motion returnable December 22, 2016, requesting leave to call oral evidence
    from his accountant on his motion for an accounting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With the exception of the December 22, 2016
    motion, all the motions were dealt with on February 1, 2017. </span></p>

    leave, in the December 2016 order, to the husband to call oral evidence from
    his accountant, subject to two conditions and subject to the further direction
    of the motion judge presiding at the motion on February 1, 2017. First, the
    accountant’s evidence in-chief would not exceed 30 minutes. Second, the
    accountant would provide a letter to the wife’s counsel by January 20, 2017, outlining
    his intended evidence. However, as noted above, although the motion judge
    stated the latter condition on one occasion orally<a href="#_ftn2"

    referred to it as accurate as of March 4, 2008, page two of the document
    indicates it addresses income from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. On January
    26, 2017, the husband delivered his net family property statement. Although these
    documents refer to various &quot;Tab[s]&quot;, neither appends a document

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge’s reasons</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    pleadings, the motion judge noted that the continuing record consisted of 12
    volumes and disclosed that 16 judges had been involved in the case. He observed
    that the wife’s affidavit set out many examples of the husband’s “effort to
    stand in the way of the progress of the application and act to the disadvantage
    of” the wife. Further, he noted breaches of four orders and stated the
    following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>1. The September 12, 2016 order …:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>a) No Financial Statement in 5 years. Order

    document brief. In breach of September 12, 2016 order ….</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>c) By September 12, 2016, not file personal
    tax returns from 2010 to 2015.</span></p>

    conference undertaking to set out attempts to find employment. Nothing provided

    assisted with his mother’s farm.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>3. August 25, 2011, [the motion judge] ordered
    answers to his undertakings. Some still outstanding.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>4. Breach of [the motion judge’s] August 30,

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge concluded his reasons as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[Counsel for the wife] has tried a number of
    times to move this matter onto a trial list but the lack of financial
    disclosure has stood in his way to end this litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>This case is now at the 9 year mark. This is
    about 7 years too long.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The administration of justice must not suffer,
    beyond this date, further delay. In fairness to [the wife], she should be able
    to move ahead to finalize what is left to be done and without [the husband] continuing
    to stand in her way. His pleadings are struck. This case is one of those cases
    which requires this exceptional response to the behaviour of [the husband].</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As we have said, in our view, the
    husband’s appeal from that part of the February 2017 order striking his pleadings
    must be allowed for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>First, the transcript of the
    motion heard on February 1, 2017 demonstrates the appellant was denied the
    opportunity to respond fully to the wife’s motion to strike. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The early part of the motion
    hearing was devoted to sorting out what motions were before the court and what
    the record would be for purposes of the motion hearing. The motion judge made
    two rulings related to these issues. In ruling one, he denied the husband the
    opportunity to call oral evidence from his accountant. In ruling two, he struck
    the appellant’s reply factum based largely on the wife’s counsel’s stated
    objections to it. Both of these rulings adversely affected the husband’s
    ability to respond to the wife’s motion to strike, and both rulings are
    problematic.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ruling one adversely affected the
    appellant’s ability to respond to the motion to strike because the appellant’s
    accountant was being called to explain his concerns about the reconciliation of
    trust funds held by the wife’s counsel and the difficulties it created in
    preparing income tax returns. Although this evidence related primarily to the
    husband’s motion for an accounting and other relief related to the farm
    proceeds of sale held in trust, it was also relevant to the motion to strike. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>It is not clear from his reasons
    that the motion judge appreciated the husband’s position that the income tax
    returns, which had been ordered produced within 30 days of the September 2016
    disclosure order, had not been finalized within that period because of
    questions raised by the husband’s accountant about reconciliation of the trust
    funds held by the wife’s counsel. These questions later resulted in the wife’s
    counsel asserting that an error had been made in the distribution of trust
    funds. As we have said, on appeal, both counsel agreed that, in fact, no error
    was made. Nonetheless, it is apparent that, as of October 2016, confusion
    existed over how the trust funds had been distributed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ruling one is problematic because
    the motion judge focused on the terms of the formal December 2016 order, which
    required that a letter outlining the husband’s evidence be sent to the wife’s
    counsel. The transcript reveals that the motion judge never grasped, or even
    entertained, the husband’s point that the handwritten endorsement did not say
    the letter should be sent to the wife’s counsel – or the husband’s position
    that he had filed the necessary letter with the trial coordinator. Had the
    motion judge grasped the husband’s position, it may well have been possible to
    receive the accountant’s evidence by affording the wife’s experienced counsel
    an opportunity to review the accountant’s letter that the appellant asserted he
    had filed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ruling two adversely affected the
    husband’s position on the motion to strike because, after the ruling to strike his
    reply factum was made, the husband asserted that, among other things, it
    contained answers to undertakings and document briefs<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a>.
    The wife’s counsel objected to the reply factum because neither the </span><em>Family
    Law Rules</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, O. Reg. 114/99, nor the </span><em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194,
    provide for a reply factum; because it was delivered on January 30, 2017, only
    two days before the motion hearing; and because it contained evidence that was not
    under oath. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Ruling two is problematic because
    there is no indication the motion judge turned his mind to whether the reply
    factum contained any material that could properly be considered on any of the
    motions before the court for the husband’s benefit – such as answers to
    undertakings, responses to outstanding orders for disclosure, or documents that
    related to the husband’s net family property or financial statements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Although the </span><em>Family Law
    Rules</em><span style='line-height:200%'> and the </span><em>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</em><span style='line-height:200%'> are designed, at least in part,
    to ensure procedural orderliness and efficiency, they are not so rigid or
    inflexible as to preclude the court from examining non-compliant documents
    submitted by self-represented litigants to ensure that any properly admissible
    portions are received. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>A key issue on the motion to
    strike was the husband’s state of compliance as of the date of the motion
    hearing. Contrary to the subsequent submissions of the wife’s counsel, if the
    husband delivered documents in advance of the motion hearing to comply with
    outstanding undertakings or court orders, he should not have been precluded
    from demonstrating compliance because he did not file an affidavit in response
    to the motion to strike. If the documents or responses were included in his
    reply factum, that demonstrated pre-hearing compliance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The husband did not file fresh
    evidence on appeal. We do not, therefore, know whether he filed a letter from
    his accountant with the court office or what additional information his reply
    factum contained. What we do know is that he did not have the opportunity to
    convey fully his position on these issues to the motion judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second, although the motion judge relied
    on a finding that the wife’s counsel had tried “a number of times to move this
    matter onto a trial list but the lack of financial disclosure [had] stood in
    his way to end this litigation”, that is not an accurate characterization of
    how the case progressed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The record reveals that the wife’s
    counsel agreed to adjourn the trial from the September 2015 trial list, albeit
    because the husband was not available to attend. The matter next came up for
    trial in September 2016. The wife did not move for disclosure until the
    sittings were underway. Issues over reconciliation of the trust funds held by
    the wife’s counsel contributed to delay in completing the disclosure, and the
    November 7, 2016 trial date was vacated on consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In the result, the record does not,
    in fact, reveal a consistent effort by the wife’s counsel to pursue outstanding
    disclosure or to get this matter on for trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Third, in the context of not
    having a full picture of the husband’s position on the motion to strike, </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>the motion judge failed to properly
    consider whether any lesser remedy would suffice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>It is a “well-established
    principle that in a family law case, pleadings should be struck only in
    exceptional circumstances, and where no other remedy would suffice”: </span><em>Kovachis

    R.F.L. (7th) 6, at paras. 11-13. Nonetheless, before striking pleadings, a
    court should consider not only the availability of any alternate remedy, but
    also the importance and materiality of any items not produced:<i> </i></span><em>Kovachis</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Here, the motion judge could not
    properly carry out that function. He did not allow the husband to file his
    reply factum so that he (the motion judge) could assess to what extent it
    provided additional compliance with outstanding undertakings or court orders. And
    he did not explore whether the husband’s accountant could be permitted to
    testify on terms that were fair to the wife’s counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>In this case, the
    husband has a strong incentive to make proper disclosure before this case
    proceeds to trial.</span><span style='line-height:200%'> He takes the position
    that his preferred share in the farm corporation (arising from his prior
    ownership of the farm) makes the common shares that he and the wife hold
    essentially worthless. He also takes the position that the interim support
    being charged to his share of the farm proceeds is too high because it is based
    on an inflated imputed income. However, he cannot expect to advance these
    positions at trial if he does not make full and fair documentary disclosure
    about his assets, income, and ability to work (including full particulars of
    any attempts at retraining or finding work).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Based on our review of
    the existing record, by the time of the motion, the wife had disclosure of the
    husband's personal and corporate income tax returns for years exceeding those
    required under the September 2016 disclosure order, as well as at least draft
    corporate financial statements. The husband had also delivered a financial
    statement purporting to set out his income for 2016, as well as a net family
    property statement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>Although the husband’s
    financial statement lacked particulars (including the sources of his income and
    the amount of income from each source) and although his net family property
    statement did not include a document brief, a specific order could have been
    made requiring the husband to produce specific documents related to his income.
    Similarly, it was not made clear in any of the September 2016 disclosure order,
    the motion judge’s reasons, or the material filed before us what documents the
    husband was to include in the document brief to be delivered with the husband’s
    net family property statement. We note that in her October 2016 correspondence,
    the husband’s counsel purported to forward to the wife’s counsel documents
    related to date of marriage values for his property. If the husband was
    required to produce any documents other than those described in particular
    rules, the required documents ought to have been specified. </span></p>
