  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of
    Justice Mario D. Faieta of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 30, 2016,
    with reasons reported at 2016 ONSC 4337, 132 O.R. (3d) 588, allowing an appeal
    from the preliminary decision of Arbitrator Shari L. Novick, dated October 20,
    2015.</p>
  <p><strong>van Rensburg J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1><span style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>This appeal arises in the context
    of a dispute between insurers with respect to the payment of statutory accident
    benefits (“SABS”), and the determination by the arbitrator of a preliminary
    issue. In this case, the SABS claimant was not notified of the priority dispute
    between the insurers until after arbitration proceedings had been commenced. The
    issue is whether the late notice to the claimant precluded the appellant from
    contesting its liability to pay SABS and from proceeding with the arbitration.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The arbitrator determined the
    issue in favour of the appellant. This decision was reversed on appeal to the
    Superior Court of Justice. The appeal judge applied a correctness standard of
    review and substituted his own interpretation of the applicable regulation for
    that of the arbitrator.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons that follow, I
    would allow the appeal and restore the decision of the arbitrator. As I will
    explain, the appeal judge ought to have applied a reasonableness standard of
    review to the arbitrator’s decision. Typically, the decisions of SABS
    arbitrators respecting priority disputes are subject to review for
    reasonableness on appeal, even where the principal issue, as here, is a
    question of law. The arbitrator was a specialized decision-maker engaged in
    interpreting her home statute and regulation in the context of the
    determination of a preliminary issue in a priority dispute under the SABS
    regime. The arbitrator’s interpretation of the requirements of the regulation
    was reasonable, as was her determination that the appellant’s notice to the
    claimant only after the arbitration proceedings were underway did not bar the
    appellant from pursuing its priority dispute with the respondent. </span></p>

    did not send a copy of the DBI Notice to the claimant or otherwise notify him
    of the priority dispute between the insurers.</span></p>

    calls with the arbitrator, Dominion notified Mr.&nbsp;Fan of the dispute
    between the insurers by letter dated June 23, 2014 that enclosed the DBI Notice.
    The notice informed Mr.&nbsp;Fan of his right to object to the transfer of his
    claim and, if he objected, of his right to participate in any proceeding that
    might take place to determine which insurer was responsible to pay SABS. Mr.
    Fan did not respond to the notice. He attended an examination under oath in
    July 2014. He continued to receive benefits from Dominion. He did not resolve
    his SABS claim with Dominion, and the claim remained open during these
    proceedings.</span></p>

    arbitration hearing, Unifund made a preliminary objection to the jurisdiction
    of the arbitrator. The objection was based on Dominion’s failure to notify the
    claimant of the dispute between the insurers within 90 days of its receipt of the
    application for SABS. Unifund argued that such notice was a statutory
    precondition to Dominion’s claim that Unifund pay the claimant’s SABS. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>, O. Reg. 283/95, governs the procedures to be
    followed by insurers in a SABS priority dispute. The relevant sections of the
    regulation are as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>2.1(6) The first insurer that receives a completed
    application for benefits from the applicant shall commence paying the benefits
    in accordance with the provisions of the Schedule pending the resolution of any
    dispute as to which insurer is required to pay the benefits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>…</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>3.(1) No insurer may dispute its obligation to pay
    benefits under section 268 of the Act unless it gives written notice within 90
    days of receipt of a completed application for benefits to every insurer who it
    claims is required to pay under that section. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) An insurer may give notice after the 90-day
    period if,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(a) 90 days was not a sufficient period of time to
    make a determination that another insurer or insurers is liable under section
    268 of the Act; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(b) the insurer made the reasonable investigations
    necessary to determine if another insurer was liable within the 90-day period. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3) The issue of whether an insurer who has not given
    notice within 90 days has complied with subsection (2) shall be resolved in an
    arbitration under section 7.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='background:white'>…</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='background:white'>4.</span><span
style='background:white'>(1) An insurer that gives notice under section 3 shall
    also give notice to the insured person using a form approved by the
    Superintendent. [the approved form is in the form of the DBI Notice].</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='background:white'> …</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>5.(1) An insured person who receives a notice under
    section 4 shall advise the insurer paying benefits in writing within 14 days
    whether he or she objects to the transfer of the claim to the insurers referred
    to in the notice. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) If the insured person does not advise the insurer
    within 14 days that he or she objects to the transfer of the claim, the insured
    person is not entitled to object to any subsequent agreement or decision to
    transfer the claim to the insurers referred to in the notice. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3) Subject to subsection 7(5), an insured person who
    has given notice of an objection is entitled to participate as a party in any
    subsequent proceeding to settle the dispute and no agreement between insurers
    as to which insurer should pay the claim is binding unless the insured person
    consents to the agreement or 14 days have passed since the insured person was
    notified in writing of an agreement and the insured person has not initiated an
    arbitration under the&nbsp;<i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>6. (1) The insured person shall provide the insurers
    with all relevant information needed to determine who is required to pay
    benefits under section 268 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) Upon request by the first insurer that receives a
    completed application for benefits, the insured person shall submit to one
    examination under oath for the purpose of determining who is required to pay
    benefits under section 268 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>…</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(4) The scope of the examination under oath is
    limited to matters that are relevant to determining who is required to pay
    benefits under section 268 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>… </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>7.<b> </b>(1) If the insurers cannot agree as to who
    is required to pay benefits, the dispute shall be resolved through an
    arbitration under the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> initiated by the insurer
    paying benefits under section 2 or 2.1 or any other insurer against whom the
    obligation to pay benefits is claimed. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) If an insured person was entitled to receive a
    notice under section 4, has given a notice of objection under section 5 and
    disagrees with an agreement among insurers that an insurer other than the
    insurer selected by the insured person should pay the benefits, the dispute
    shall be resolved through an arbitration under the&nbsp;<i>Arbitration Act,
    1991</i>&nbsp;initiated by the insured person. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3) The arbitration may
    be initiated by an insurer or by the insured person no later than one year
    after the day the insurer paying benefits first gives notice under section 3. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The parties agreed to the
    arbitration of their priority dispute by Arbitrator Shari L. Novick. In her
    decision dated October 20, 2015 she determined Unifund’s preliminary objection
    that Dominion was out of time to pursue the dispute. She concluded that
    Dominion was not precluded from pursuing its priority dispute even though it
    did not send the required notice to the claimant until after the arbitration
    proceeding had been commenced. </span></p>

    of the regulation imposes a mandatory obligation on the first insurer who receives
    a completed application to provide notice to the insured person of its
    intention to dispute its obligation to pay benefits. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The arbitrator determined,
    however, that the requirement that the insurer “shall also” give notice to the
    insured person does not require such notice to be given within 90 days of
    receipt of the SABS application. She noted that the purpose of the section was for
    claimants to be notified of an ongoing priority dispute between insurers, and to
    be provided with the opportunity to participate in it. Nevertheless, the rights
    provided to claimants to participate in the process are entirely procedural. No
    determination of priority between insurers will affect a claimant’s entitlement
    to accident benefits, nor would the claimant’s position on the dispute affect
    its determination, which depends on the provisions of s. 268(2) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>More than two years after notice
    was provided to Unifund under s. 3 of the regulation, Dominion gave notice to
    Mr. Fan that it was disputing its obligation to pay benefits. This was approximately
    six months after the first arbitration pre-hearing teleconference was held. Mr.
    Fan received notice while the claim was still open, and as such he had the
    opportunity to participate in the process. The arbitrator acknowledged that
    insurers should ideally provide notice to claimants at the same time as notice
    is given to the other insurer. Even so, Dominion’s very late notice to Mr. Fan satisfied
    the requirement in s. 4 of the regulation to “also” give notice of the dispute
    to the claimant. It provided him with the opportunity to participate in the
    process.</span></p>

    within that period would cause the claimant to lose the right to initiate an

    year of the s. 3 notice. </span></p>

    drafters of the regulation intended to provide a right to an insured to
    initiate an arbitration in a priority dispute between insurers (something the
    arbitrator described as “extremely rare – if not unprecedented”). The right to
    initiate arbitration is referred to in both ss. 5(3) and 7(3) of the regulation.
    The arbitrator noted the inconsistency between the s. 5(3) requirement that an
    insured who objects to a proposed transfer of a claim initiate arbitration
    within 14 days, and the provision in s. 7(3) that an insured may initiate
    arbitration no later than one year after the day the first insurer gives its
    notice to the other insurer under s. 3. She observed that insurers might agree
    to transfer a claim years after the s. 3 notice was given. It would not make
    sense for a claimant to be precluded from maintaining an objection if the
    insurers reached an agreement more than one year after the s. 3 notice was
    provided. She concluded that the language in s.&nbsp;7(3) would not prohibit a
    claimant who was otherwise validly exercising the right to object to an
    agreement under s. 5(3) from initiating arbitration. The arbitrator rejected Unifund’s
    argument based on s. 7(3) that a 90 day deadline for giving notice was
    necessary to protect the claimant’s participation rights.</span></p>

    characterize the 90 day period as a type of “limitation period” in default of
    which an arbitration cannot be commenced, it is a time limit that exists within
    a statutory scheme. Its interpretation only affects those who have rights and
    obligations under that scheme. This is not a general question of law that
    transcends the specific regime, or “that is both of central importance to the

    engages a reading of s. 4 in the context of other sections of the regulation,

    the SABS regime. There is every reason to accord deference to the reasonable
    interpretation of the priority regulation by an arbitrator who has specialized

    268(2) of the Act, and not on any objection or position taken by the claimant. </span></p>

    characterized the claimant’s rights as procedural. It was reasonable for the
    arbitrator to conclude that a 90 day time limit was not essential to protect the
    claimant’s rights to object and participate, which could be protected in other
    ways. In this case for example, the claimant’s rights were protected by ensuring
    that he received notice and had the opportunity to object before the arbitration
    hearing to determine the priorities dispute was underway. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>As for the policy objective of
    ensuring certainty for insurers in the dispute resolution regime, Unifund
    points to Sharpe J.A.’s observation in <em>Kingsway General Insurance Company
    v. West Wawanosh Insurance Company </em>(2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 251, at para. 10, that,
    “clarity and certainty of application are of primary concern. Insurers need to
    make appropriate decisions with respect to conducting investigations,
    establishing reserves and maintaining records.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Strict compliance with the time
    limit for notice between insurers is mandated by the provision in s. 3 that, where
    notice to the other insurer(s) is not given in time, the first insurer is
    precluded from disputing its obligation to pay benefits. If there is a dispute
    about whether an extended time limit was required, that issue will be the
    subject of arbitration: s.&nbsp;3(3). In this case, the rights of the second
    insurer, Unifund, in the priority dispute resolution process were protected by
    its having received timely notice of the SABS claim from the first insurer -
    giving it time to properly evaluate Mr. Fan’s claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Unifund seeks to read into s. 4 not
    only the time limit for notice between insurers, but also the consequence for
    the failure to give timely notice – the prohibition of the dispute. Section 4
    contains no such time limit or consequence. Whether a claimant is given notice
    of a priority dispute within 90 days of submitting an application for SABS will
    have no impact on the rights of the second insurer. While notice to the second
    insurer serves the important function of permitting it to evaluate the SABS
    claim, notice to the insured serves no function at all in the determination of
    the priority dispute or rights between the insurers. Unifund’s preliminary objection
    based on the lateness of the s. 4 notice is not based on any prejudice to its
    own position in the priority dispute arising out of late notice to the claimant.
    Indeed, this interpretation would provide Unifund with a windfall, if, under s.
    268(2), it was the proper insurer to respond to Mr. Fan’s SABS claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The overriding objective of the
    regulation is to provide a procedure to determine priority disputes. That objective
    would not be furthered, and may well be undermined, by importing a requirement
    that has nothing to do with the determination of the dispute or the rights of
    the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'> Unifund also contends that the
    arbitrator’s decision fails to give effect to the express wording of s. 7(3),
    which requires an arbitration to be commenced by a claimant within one year of
    the s. 3 notice. Unifund’s argument, which was accepted by the appeal judge, is
    that the claimant’s participation rights would be meaningless if the claimant
    was unaware of the dispute until after the one year time limit on initiating
    arbitration of the dispute had passed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The arbitrator dealt with this submission
    in some detail. She noted the inconsistency between s. 5(3), which imposes a 14
    day time limit to the insured for commencing an arbitration, after the
    agreement between insurers, and s. 7(3). Giving the claimant notice within 90
    days would not solve the apparent problem of the one year delay expiring after
    the s. 3 notice, but before a settlement was reached. If that were the case, the
    insured could be prevented from commencing an arbitration if he or she objected
    to the settlement. The arbitrator reasonably concluded that the language of s.&nbsp;7(3)
    would not prohibit a claimant, who was otherwise validly exercising his or her
    right to object to an agreement in accordance with s. 5(3), from initiating
    arbitration.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The prescribed DBI Notice form appears
    to anticipate that notice will be given to the claimant at or around the same
    time as it is given to the other insured. There is no practical reason why
    notice could not be given at the same time. The question however is whether the
    failure to give such notice in a timely way should preclude the priority claim altogether,
    or whether it should be up to the arbitrator to determine the consequences of
    late notice. The arbitrator in this case concluded that, while there is no time
    limit for notice to be given to a claimant, it will be up to the arbitrator to
    determine whether the notice required by s. 4 has been given too late to permit
    the claimant to exercise the participation rights afforded by the regulation.
    This is a reasonable approach as the arbitrator is well-positioned to safeguard
    those rights and to address any prejudice.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Here, the insured did receive
    notice before the arbitration hearing commenced, and did not object to the
    transfer of the claim. He was therefore not entitled to further participation
    in the insurers’ priority dispute. There was no prejudice. The arbitrator
    reasonably concluded that, while the notice was late, the lateness was not an
    impediment to the insurers’ arbitration of the dispute. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>For all of these reasons, the
    arbitrator’s decision was reasonable, and ought not to have been overturned on
    appeal.</span></p>
