  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown appeals from a decision refusing to
    impose a s. 161(1) <em>Criminal Code </em>prohibition order. The appellant
    alleges that the trial judge erroneously failed to take into account public
    safety concerns when he refused to impose the order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was found guilty by a jury of
    sexual assault and sexual interference. At the sentencing hearing, the trial
    judge found as a fact that the appellant engaged in more than twenty acts of sexual
    intercourse with his step-daughter over a 2.5 year period. She was between six
    and eight years of age at the time of these assaults. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sexual interference count was conditionally
    stayed and a 6.5 year sentence was imposed on the sexual assault count. DNA,
    firearms and </span><em>Sex Offender Information Registration Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>, S.C. 2004, c. 10</span><em><span lang=EN-US> </span></em><span
lang=EN-US>orders were made. The s. 161 prohibition order was refused. The
    trial judge’s reasons for refusing to make the order are as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>As to the prohibition order sought pursuant to
    s. 161 of the </span><em>Code, </em><span lang=EN-US>I agree with Daley J.
    where he held in </span><em>R. v. M.A.J., </em><span lang=EN-US>2012 ONSC 6415
    … that this is not a proper or necessary order in the circumstances. Such an
    order represents a considerable interference with personal liberty, and it
    would be most difficult for this offender to completely avoid places accessible
    to the public for recreational use like public parks or community centres if he
    is ever allowed to renew contact with his children. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant does not object to the trial judge
    considering the impact that a s. 161 prohibition order would have on the
    respondent. Rather, the objection lies in what the appellant says that the
    trial judge did not consider. It is said that the trial judge committed
    reversible error when he failed to consider the respondent’s threat to public
    safety. The appellant argues that had the respondent’s risk factors been
    properly considered, a prohibition order would have been imposed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>R. v. K.R.J., </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>2016 SCC 31, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 906, </span></em>at
    para. 72, Karakatsanis J. reviewed the purpose of prohibition orders under s.
    161: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Prohibitions listed in s. 161(1) are to be
    imposed only when a judge is satisfied that the specific offender poses a
    continued risk to children upon his release into the community </span><em>and </em><span
lang=EN-US>that the specific terms of the order are a reasonable attempt to
    minimize the risk. [emphasis in original]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We agree that the trial judge failed to have
    regard to all of the appropriate considerations when he refused to impose a s.
    161 prohibition order. In fairness to the trial judge, he received no
    assistance from counsel on this issue. Indeed, the trial Crown did little more
    than ask for the imposition of a blanket order.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent correctly points out that, in
    arriving upon his overall disposition, the trial judge carefully reviewed the
    factual record before him, including the circumstances of the offence and the
    offender. The respondent maintains that, considered in context, the trial judge
    should be taken to have considered the public safety concerns when dismissing
    the s. 161 order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge recounted many of the
    facts informing the respondent’s ongoing risk to children, having regard to the
    reasons given, we are not satisfied that he took that risk into account when he
    refused to impose the s. 161 order.  We find that the appellant poses a
    continued risk to children. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In relation to the risk factors, we have
    particular regard to the pre-sentence report that refers to the respondent’s denial
    of sexually inappropriate behavior, something that increases his risk of
    re-offence. Drawing from the psychiatric opinion, the probation officer
    commented upon the respondent’s “deviant sexual preference that will require
    programming to assist the development of self-management strategies to avoid
    future behaviours.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. J. Gray, the psychiatrist who assessed the
    respondent, commented upon the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder, concluding
    that the respondent is at a moderate risk of sexual or violent reoffending. Dr.
    Gray also expressed the opinion that the respondent should not have
    unsupervised contact with females under the age of 18 years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, this was not the respondent’s first
    offence. In 1989 he was convicted on two counts of break and enter with intent
    and sexual assault. He was highly intoxicated when he entered a home and went into
    a young girl’s bedroom. He kissed her on the cheek and attempted to remove her
    bedcovers when she pushed him away and told him to leave. He then went to the
    mother’s bedroom, attempted to get into bed with her and was told to leave. He
    pled guilty and received a suspended sentence and two years probation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since the offending conduct occurred, the
    respondent has become involved in another relationship with a woman with whom
    he now shares a child. His wife also has a daughter who is around the same age as
    the victim, when the victim was assaulted. Following the charges being laid in
    this matter, the Children’s Aid Society became involved. Since that time, the
    respondent has been required to live away from the family.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although we agree with the trial judge that a prohibition
    order would represent a considerable interference with the respondent’s
    liberty, the imposition of a s. 161 order is a necessary measure to minimize
    the risk he poses to child safety. The order can and should be tailored to
    address the liberty concerns. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant asks for an order to be imposed in
    accordance with the versions of s. 161(1)(a) and (b) that were in force at the
    time that the offences were committed. Having regard to all of the
    circumstances, including the circumstances underlying the offence, the
    respondent’s past, and the psychiatric evidence filed, we impose a prohibition
    order as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>(a) The
    respondent is prohibited from attending a public park or public swimming area
    where persons under the age of 16 years are present or can reasonably be
    expected to be present, or a daycare centre, schoolground, playground or
    community centre, unless he is in the company of another adult; and </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>(b) The
    respondent is prohibited from seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment,
    whether or not the employment is remunerated or becoming or being a volunteer
    in a capacity that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards
    persons under the age of 16 years.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal is granted, the refusal to impose a
    s. 161 order is set aside and a s. 161 order is granted in accordance with these
    reasons for a duration of 15 years from the date the respondent is released
    from imprisonment, including release on parole, mandatory supervision or
    statutory release. </span></p>
