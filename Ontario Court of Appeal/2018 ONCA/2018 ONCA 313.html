  <p style='text-align:justify'>On appeal from the orders of
    Justice E. Ria Tzimas of the Superior Court of Justice, dated January 6, 2017 with
    reasons reported at 2017 ONSC 114, and of Justice John R. McCarthy of the
    Superior Court of Justice, dated January 13, 2017 with reasons reported at 2017
    ONSC 222.</p>
  <p><b>Nordheimer J.A.:</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These two appeals were heard together as they raise common issues. In
    both cases, the plaintiffs were patrons of the defendant ski resorts who purchased
    ski tickets. In both cases, those patrons executed the ski resorts’ waivers of
    liability as a condition of their tickets. And in both cases, the patrons were
    injured on the ski resorts’ premises. The patrons sued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a r. 21 motion under the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194 in the case of Mr. Schnarr, the parties agreed that there was a
    “consumer agreement” (as defined under s. 1 of the <em>Consumer Protection Act,
    2002</em>, S.O. 2002, c. 30, Sched. A (“<em>CPA</em>”)) between Mr. Schnarr and
    Blue Mountain Resorts Limited (“Blue Mountain”). On that basis, Tzimas J. held
    that Blue Mountain’s waiver under s. 3(3) of the <em>Occupiers’ Liability Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2 (“<em>OLA</em>”) partially offended ss. 7(1) and 9(3) of
    the <em>CPA</em>. She held that Blue Mountain’s waiver, insofar as it purported
    to waive liability in contract, was void and severed from the consumer
    agreement. In a similar vein, in the case of Ms. Woodhouse on a r. 22 motion,
    McCarthy J. held that Snow Valley’s waiver was void in respect of both tort and
    contract claims. However, he held that a court nevertheless had the equitable
    power to enforce a void waiver in a consumer agreement pursuant to s. 93(2) of
    the <em>CPA</em>. It is important to note that, aside from the agreed statement
    of facts submitted by the parties, none of the underlying facts have yet been
    proven in court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blue Mountain and Ms. Woodhouse appeal. Snow Valley cross-appeals. Foremost,
    these appeals raise the question of whether the <em>CPA</em><i> </i>or the <em>OLA</em> governs the relationship between the parties. Specifically, the appeals present
    a case of first impression as to whether ss. 7 and 9 of the <em>CPA</em> vitiate
    or void an otherwise valid waiver of liability under s. 3 of the <em>OLA</em>,
    where the party seeking to rely on the waiver is both a “supplier” under the <em>CPA</em> and an “occupier” under the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, when applied to the instant context, ss. 7 and 9 of the <em>CPA</em> fundamentally undermine the purpose of s. 3 of the <em>OLA</em>. The statutes
    are irreconcilable and conflict. As such, and as I shall explain below, the
    more specific provision in the <em>OLA</em> prevails over the general provisions
    in the <em>CPA</em>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> I would therefore allow both Blue Mountain’s appeal and Snow Valley’s
    cross-appeal for the reasons that follow. On the separate issue of the
    application of s. 93(2) of the <em>CPA</em>, I would also allow Ms. Woodhouse’s
    appeal.</p>
  <h1>Background Facts – Schnarr v. Blue Mountain Resorts Limited</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Schnarr purchased a 2010-2011 season ski pass from Blue Mountain's website
    on April 29, 2010. As part of his online transaction, Mr. Schnarr executed a Release
    of Liability Agreement, Waiver of Claims, Assumption of Risk and Indemnity
    Agreement (the “Blue Mountain waiver”).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 26, 2011, while skiing down a ski run called &quot;Smart Alec&quot;,
    Mr. Schnarr allegedly collided with a piece of debris from a broken ski pole.
    He lost control, struck a tree, and sustained injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Blue Mountain waiver contained a number of provisions purporting to
    shield Blue Mountain from certain liabilities and preclude Mr. Schnarr from
    suing. One heading, set out in bold type in a yellow box with a red border,
    specifically instructed the customer to “PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!” and cautioned Mr.
    Schnarr that by executing the document, he was giving up certain legal rights.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The waiver specifically provided that in consideration for Blue Mountain
    accepting his application for a season pass, Mr. Schnarr agreed both to waive
    any and all claims against the ski area operator and others, and to release
    them from liability for any damages that he may suffer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 13, 2011, Mr. Schnarr commenced an action in negligence
    against Blue Mountain. Mr. Schnarr claimed general damages in the sum of
    $200,000 and special damages in the sum of $100,000.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 4, 2016, Mr. Schnarr amended his statement of claim. Under the heading “Applicable
    Statutes”, he claimed for the first time that the season ski pass was a
    consumer transaction. He also alleged that Blue Mountain had breached the “reasonably
    acceptable quality” standard under s. 9(1) of the <em>CPA</em>. The particulars
    of this alleged breach were identical to the alleged breaches of the standard
    of care in the tort of negligence as advanced in the original statement of claim.
    In addition, in his amended statement of claim, Mr. Schnarr also pleaded that
    he was relying on s. 7(1) of the <em>CPA</em> to vitiate the entirety of the
    Blue Mountain waiver. He did not plead any additional or different facts to support
    his allegation that Blue Mountain failed to provide a reasonably acceptable
    quality of service.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial was originally scheduled to start in January 2016, Tzimas J.
    concluded that, due to the amendment of the statement of claim and the novel
    issue of law raised, the case should first proceed by way of a r. 21 motion.
    Justice Tzimas ordered a determination of a question of law under r. 21.01(1)(a)
    based on the pleadings before trial. Justice Tzimas did not receive any
    evidence other than the parties’ agreed statement of facts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 6, 2017, Tzimas J. released her reasons on the r. 21 motion. Justice
    Tzimas held that there was no conflict between the impugned sections of the <em>CPA</em> and <em>OLA</em>, and that the relevant provisions could be read harmoniously
    under modern principles of statutory interpretation. She concluded that, by operation
    of ss. 7(1), 9(1), and 9(3) of the <em>CPA</em>, the defendant could not
    disclaim liability for any breach of the deemed warranty of providing services
    of a “reasonably acceptable quality”. She went on to determine that Mr. Schnarr
    would be allowed to advance two distinct causes of action: one for negligence
    and the second for breach of warranty. She found that the negligence claim
    would be subject to the Blue Mountain waiver but that the breach of warranty
    claim would not be subject to that waiver since the portions purporting to
    waive liability for breach of warranty would be void and severed under ss. 9(3)
    and (4) of the <em>CPA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blue
    Mountain appeals from that decision.</p>
  <h1>Background Facts – <em>Woodhouse v. Snow Valley</em></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 23, 2008, Ms. Woodhouse went skiing with her husband and grandson at
    Snow Valley. Ms. Woodhouse purchased a beginner ski package from Snow Valley,
    which included a lift ticket, equipment rental, and a lesson.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lift ticket itself contained a Release of Liability. Moreover, Ms. Woodhouse was
    also required to execute a Rental Agreement and Release of Liability on
    December 23, 2008 when she purchased the beginner ski package (the “Snow Valley
    waiver”).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[3]</span></span></span></a> That document contains a section entitled “Waiver of Claims”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    release on the lift ticket and the content of the Snow Valley waiver were never
    explained by Snow Valley to Ms. Woodhouse. However, prior to attending Snow
    Valley on December 23, 2008, Ms. Woodhouse reviewed the Snow Valley waiver’s
    wording on Snow Valley’s website. Nevertheless, Ms. Woodhouse was neither
    informed of nor aware of the <em>CPA</em> or any rights it afforded her on or
    prior to December 23, 2008.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    signing the Snow Valley waiver, Ms. Woodhouse and her family took a ski lesson
    on December 23, 2008. After the ski lesson, Ms. Woodhouse and her family used
    the ski facilities for several hours. Ultimately, while using a tow rope, Ms.
    Woodhouse allegedly sustained injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 9, 2012, Ms. Woodhouse commenced an action in negligence for the injuries
    that she suffered. The parties eventually agreed to bring a r. 22 special case motion
    that raised five questions of law, all relating to the applicability of the <em>CPA</em> to Ms. Woodhouse’s injuries allegedly sustained at Snow Valley.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 13, 2017, McCarthy J. released his reasons on the r. 22 special case
    motion. He held that the <em>CPA</em> applied to the instant case.
    Consequently, he concluded that the Snow Valley waiver was presumptively void
    and, therefore, Ms. Woodhouse was entitled to proceed with her claim. Importantly,
    McCarthy J. held that s. 9 of the <em>CPA</em> voided the Snow Valley waiver in
    respect of both tort and contract claims. Justice McCarthy found that the <em>OLA</em>’s
    provisions did not supersede the <em>CPA</em>’s. However, he also held that a
    court could nonetheless order that Ms. Woodhouse was bound by the Snow Valley waiver
    by virtue of s. 93(2) of the <em>CPA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Woodhouse appeals from the McCarthy J.’s conclusion regarding the applicability
    of s. 93(2) of the <em>CPA</em>. Snow Valley cross-appeals from the conclusion
    that s. 9 of the <em>CPA</em> voids an otherwise valid waiver under s. 3 of the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <h1>Issues on Appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties framed their grounds of appeal in various ways. However, in my view,
    they can all be grouped into the following broad issues:</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does s. 9 of the <em>CPA</em> conflict with s. 3 of the <em>OLA</em>, or
    can the impugned provisions be read harmoniously?</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If they conflict, how should each statute be interpreted and what effect

  <h1>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset, I note that the parties agree that the statutory interpretation
    issues raised by these appeals involve questions of law and thus the standard
    of review is correctness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the general principles of statutory interpretation, the Supreme
    Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the modern approach espoused in E. A. Driedger, <em>Construction of Statutes</em>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), at p.
    87 that “the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in
    their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act,
    the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: <em>Bell ExpressVu
    Ltd. Partnership v. Rex</em>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26;
    and <em>Indalex Ltd., Re</em>, 2013 SCC 6, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 271, at para. 136. I
    analyze both statutes in greater detail below to explain the relevant scheme
    and objects of the <em>OLA</em> and <em>CPA</em>, as well as the legislative
    intent.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-style:normal'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Occupiers’ Liability Act</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with the origins of the <em>OLA</em>. The <em>OLA</em> came into force in
    1980. It was enacted following the Ontario Law Reform Commission’s 1972 <em>Report
    on Occupiers’ Liability</em>, which recommended that the common law duty of
    care owed by occupiers<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> be replaced with one generalized statutory duty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    recommendation came into effect with the passage of the <em>OLA</em>. It is
    evident from the provisions of the <em>OLA</em> that the legislation was
    intended to establish a single primary duty of care that an occupier would owe
    to persons entering upon their premises. Section 3 of the <em>OLA</em> also
    prescribes a default standard of care that requires an occupier to take such
    care as is reasonable in the circumstances to keep entrants and their property
    reasonably safe on the premises. The breach of that statutory standard of care
    would make the occupier liable for injuries sustained by those entrants. As
    Lewis N. Klar and Cameron Jeffries say in their text, <em>Tort Law</em>, 6th
    ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2017), at p. 723:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It seems irrefutable that the legislation was intended to be
    exclusive and comprehensive, in so far as the liability of occupiers is
    concerned.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    intention is made clear by s. 2 of the <em>OLA</em> which reads:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Subject to section 9, this Act applies in place of the rules of
    the common law that determine the care that the occupier of premises at common
    law is required to show for the purpose of determining the occupier’s liability
    in law in respect of dangers to persons entering on the premises or the
    property brought on the premises by those persons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two critical sections of the <em>OLA</em>, for the purpose of these appeals,
    are ss. 3 and 4. I refer to the following portions of those two sections:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3(1) An occupier of premises owes a duty to take such care as
    in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable to see that persons entering
    on the premises, and the property brought on the premises by those persons are
    reasonably safe while on the premises.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) The duty of care provided for in subsection (1) applies
    whether the danger is caused by the condition of the premises or by an activity
    carried on on the premises.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) The duty of care provided for in subsection (1) applies
    except in so far as the occupier of premises is free to and does restrict,
    modify or exclude the occupier’s duty.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>4(1) The duty of care provided for in subsection 3(1) does not
    apply in respect of risks willingly assumed by the person who enters on the
    premises, but in that case the occupier owes a duty to the person to not create
    a danger with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage to the person or
    his or her property and to not act with reckless disregard of the presence of
    the person or his or her property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    considering the purpose of the <em>OLA</em>, it is of some importance to
    recognize that part of the rationale for including s. 4 in the statute was to
    encourage private landowners to voluntarily make their property available for
    recreational activities by limiting their liability. This was made clear in the <em>Discussion Paper on Occupiers’ Liability and Trespass to Property</em> issued
    by the Ministry of the Attorney General in May 1979. It was also referred to by
    Allen M. Linden and Bruce Feldthusen in their text, <em>Canadian Tort Law</em>,
    10th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada, 2015), at <span style='background:white'>§18.66</span>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This provision was included for the purpose of protecting the
    interests of the agricultural community and to promote the availability of land
    for recreational activities. The Ontario Law Reform Commission’s draft Act did
    not contain this particular section.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    although s. 3(1) of the <em>OLA</em> prescribes the primary duty and standard
    of care, the <em>OLA</em> also expressly preserves situations where a higher
    obligation or standard may apply because of specific legislation or the common
    law under s. 9(1):</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nothing in this Act relieves an occupier of premises in any
    particular case from any higher liability or any duty to show a higher standard
    of care that in that case is incumbent on the occupier by virtue of any
    enactment or rule of law imposing special liability or standards of care on
    particular classes of persons including, but without restricting the generality
    of the foregoing, the obligations of,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) innkeepers, subject to the <em>Innkeepers
    Act</em>;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) common carriers;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) bailees.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    while the Legislature left to itself the right to establish a higher liability
    or duty of care for occupiers in specific situations, it did not see fit to
    amend the <em>OLA</em> to include obligations under the <em>CPA</em>. Moreover,
    as I will explain in my reasons below, the potentially “higher” obligations
    under s. 9 of the <em>CPA</em> cannot be read into this section.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-style:normal'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span>Consumer Protection Act</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    now turn to the origins of the <em>CPA</em>. The <em>CPA</em> was enacted in
    2002. It was adopted to modernize consumer law in Ontario. Prior to the enactment
    of the <em>CPA</em>, consumer protection was found in nine different statutes.
    The purpose of the <em>CPA</em> was to consolidate those statutes and update
    the law to provide protections for newer businesses and newer forms of
    transactions that were entering the marketplace.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    sections of the <em>CPA</em> are of particular importance to these appeals. One
    is s. 7(1) which reads:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The substantive and procedural rights given under this Act
    apply despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>The other is s. 9 which reads in relevant parts:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>9(1) The supplier is deemed to warrant that the services
    supplied under a consumer agreement are of a reasonably acceptable quality.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>[…]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) Any term or acknowledgement, whether part of the consumer
    agreement or not, that purports to negate or vary any implied condition or
    warranty under the <i>Sale of Goods Act</i> or any deemed condition or warranty
    under this Act is void.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) If a term or acknowledgement referenced in subsection (3)
    is a term of the agreement, it is severable from the agreement and shall not be
    evidence of circumstances showing an intent that the deemed or implied warranty
    or condition does not apply.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to these sections, I should note that there is no disagreement between
    the parties that the plaintiffs are consumers, the defendants are suppliers,
    and that the contracts that they entered into are consumer agreements.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the enactment of the <em>CPA</em>, the Ministry of Consumer and Commercial
    Relations (now the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, the “Ministry”)
    circulated a consultation paper entitled “Consumer Protection for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century”. It explained the reasoning behind the proposed enactment of the <em>CPA</em>.
    Two salient facts can be drawn from that consultation paper.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Proposal 4(a) at p. 9 of the consultation paper points out that “consumer law
    should not apply to transactions already governed under regulatory regimes that
    adequately address consumer protection.” The paper expands on this point, at
    pp. 9-10:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although any transaction in which individuals pay for anything
    is in some sense a consumer transaction, there are <u>several areas in which
    other specialized legal regimes apply instead of consumer law</u> […] <u>The
    Ministry is not proposing that general consumer law apply to these sectors.</u></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The proposed broader definition of consumer transactions would
    also call into question its application to areas that are already regulated by
    industry- and sector-specific legislation...</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In such cases, having two applicable legal regimes could be
    confusing, both for the public and the regulated sector. Similarly, having two
    regulatory bodies creates duplication…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the consultation paper discusses all of the industry and sector specific
    concerns that drove the goal of introducing new consumer protection
    legislation. Yet there is no commentary at any point in the consultation paper
    that identifies problems with the current state of legislation relating to
    occupiers, or problems with consumer transactions involving occupiers insofar
    as they provide their premises for the use of consumers engaging in
    recreational activities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    on a fair reading of the consultation paper and the <em>CPA</em> itself, it is
    evident that the principal concern was with respect to financial transactions,
    and the potential for scams to operate to the detriment of consumers. There is
    nothing to suggest that changing the existing framework governing liability for
    personal injuries sustained by persons availing themselves of premises for
    recreational activities was in any way an objective of the <em>CPA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Schnarr and Ms. Woodhouse, and the intervener Ministry, point to the fact that
    the <em>CPA</em> exempts certain statutes under s. 2(2) and the <em>OLA</em> is
    not one of them. The thrust of this argument is based on <em>expressio unius
    est exclusio alterius</em>. However, as I will explain in my reasons below, the
    principle that things are implicitly excluded when others are expressly
    enumerated is not an absolute rule. Key to this analysis is the fact that when
    one looks at the types of exemptions provided by the <em>CPA</em>, both in s.
    2(2) and in O. Reg. 17/05, it is clear that they are primarily directed at
    financial transactions and professional services. They are not directed at the
    type of activities covered by the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is nothing in the background to the passage of the <em>CPA</em>, or in the
    provisions of the <em>CPA</em> itself, that would suggest that it was intended
    to regulate duties of care of the type stipulated by the <em>OLA</em>, or that
    it was intended to regulate liability arising from the use of premises that are
    subject to the <em>OLA</em>. This conclusion is consistent with the
    consultation paper, which makes it clear that it was not the intention of the <em>CPA</em> to apply to areas that were “already regulated by industry- and sector-specific
    legislation.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    set out the background objects of the <em>CPA</em> and the <em>OLA</em>, I turn
    now to analyze whether they conflict.</p>
  <h3>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Does s. 9 of the <i>CPA</i> conflict with s. 3 of the <i>OLA</i>?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court set out the principles of statutory interpretation with respect to
    the analysis of conflicting statutes in <em>Thibodeau v. Air Canada</em>, 2014
    SCC 67, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 340, at paras. 88ff. In that case, Air Canada failed to
    provide services in French on some international flights as required under the <em>Official
    Languages Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.). The applicant applied to
    the Federal Court for a remedy of damages but Air Canada contended that the <em>Carriage
    by Air Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-26 precluded such liability. In analyzing
    whether a conflict existed between the two statutes, the Supreme Court held at
    para. 92:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>First, courts take a restrictive approach to what constitutes a
    conflict in this context. Second, courts find that there is a conflict only
    when the existence of the conflict, in the restrictive sense of the word,
    cannot be avoided by interpretation. Overlap on its own, does not constitute
    conflict in this context, so that even where the ambit of two provisions
    overlaps, there is a presumption that they both are meant to apply, provided
    that they can do so without producing absurd results. This presumption may be
    rebutted if one of the provisions was intended to cover the subject matter
    exhaustively. Third, only where a conflict is unavoidable should the court
    resort to statutory provisions and principles of interpretation concerned with
    which law takes precedence over the other.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that the above rules of statutory interpretation urge an approach
    that avoids a finding that two statutes conflict. This approach is premised
    upon the “presumption of perfection”.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> However, those interpretive rules still recognize that conflicts will arise.
    For example, courts have held that a conflict between two statutes arises
    where:</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>provisions are so inconsistent or “repugnant” to each other that they
    are “incapable of standing together” (<em>Reference re Broadcasting Act, S.C.
    1991 (Canada)</em>, 2012 SCC 68, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 489, at paras. 41-45);</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the application of one provision must implicitly or explicitly preclude
    the application of another (<em>Lévis (Ville) v. Côté</em>, 2007 SCC 14, [2007]
    1 S.C.R. 591, at paras. 48-49); or</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>two pieces of legislation are “directly contradictory or where their
    concurrent application would lead to unreasonable or absurd results” (<em>Lévis</em>,
    at para. 47 and <em>Thibodeau</em>, at para. 95).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as I have already alluded to, there is a clear and direct conflict
    between the <em>OLA</em> and the <em>CPA</em> – and it is an unavoidable one.
    The <em>OLA</em> permits an occupier to obtain a waiver of liability. The <em>CPA</em> precludes a supplier from obtaining a waiver of liability. In other words, what
    the <em>OLA</em> permits, the <em>CPA</em> prohibits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem with the presumption of perfection is, of course, that it ignores the
    practical realities in which legislation is enacted. As Ruth Sullivan says in
    her text, <em>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</em>, 6th ed. (Toronto:
    LexisNexis Canada, 2014), at 11.32:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This analysis ignores the realities of the way legislation is
    made and the way the statute book evolves. It ignores, for example, the fact
    that legislative schemes are developed, introduced and implemented by different
    departments with different legislative priorities. It ignores the tight
    timelines and political pressures under which much legislation is drafted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    observation has direct application to the situation here. The <em>OLA</em> is
    administered by the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Sport. The <em>CPA</em> is
    administered by the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services. The two
    statutes were enacted by two different governments more than twenty years
    apart. Further, as I mentioned above, there is nothing in the consultation
    paper relating to the <em>CPA</em>, or otherwise in the record before this
    court, that suggests that, in enacting the <em>CPA</em>, any consideration was
    given to the <i>OLA</i> or to the impact that any of the provisions in the <em>CPA</em> might have on the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Schnarr and Ms. Woodhouse try to avoid the reality of a conflict between the
    statutes by submitting that there is a distinction between the ability of a
    party to sue either in contract or in tort. On that point, with due respect to
    Tzimas J., suggesting that the waiver is valid with respect to the tortious
    negligence claims, but invalid with respect to the contractual warranty claims,
    is a distinction without a difference. In this regard, Mr. Schnarr and Ms.
    Woodhouse relied heavily on the decision in <em>BG Checo International Ltd. v.
    British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority</em>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12. With
    respect, that decision does not support their position because they
    mischaracterize the nature of the issue that was engaged in that case. There is
    no doubt that the decision in <em>BG Checo</em> holds that a party has the
    choice whether to sue in contract or in tort. Indeed, they may decide to sue in
    both. No one disputes that principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, however, we are not dealing solely with duties arising from tort or
    contract. Here we are dealing with a duty of care imposed by statute: <em>Mackay
    v. Starbucks Corp.</em>, 2017 ONCA 350, 413 D.L.R. (4th) 220, at paras. 10 and
    46. It is the <em>OLA</em>’s statutorily imposed duty that all occupiers must
    meet, regardless of whether the occupier has a relationship with an injured
    party that is founded in contract or in tort. The decision in <em>BG Checo</em> does not assist Mr. Schnarr and Ms. Woodhouse in this regard. Indeed, it
    arguably assists Blue Mountain and Snow Valley because the decision recognizes
    that parties can contractually alter the rights that might otherwise be imposed
    upon them by the common law. As LaForest and McLachlin JJ. said, at p. 27:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The rule is not that one cannot sue concurrently in contract
    and tort where the contract limits or contradicts the tort duty. It is rather
    that the tort duty, a general duty imputed by the law in all the relevant
    circumstances, must yield to the parties’ superior right to arrange their
    rights and duties in a different way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>OLA</em> permits an occupier to “restrict, modify or exclude” the duty
    imposed by the statute regardless of whether a claim is founded in contract or
    in tort. The waivers in the instant appeals dealt with both Blue Mountain’s and
    Snow Valley’s contractual and tort obligations. The effort to avoid a conflict
    between the statutes on the basis that the <em>OLA</em> deals with tort
    liability and the <em>CPA</em> deals with contractual liability is not only
    artificial, it does not reflect the fact that the duty of care originates from
    the statute itself, nor does it take into account that the statute allows for
    the modification of the duty and liability arising therefrom. Moreover,
    adopting such a restricted interpretation of s. 3(3) of the <em>OLA</em> would
    go against the development trends in private law. As the majority noted in <em>BG
    Checo</em>, at p. 21, “the law should move towards the elimination of
    unjustified differences between the remedial rules applicable to the two
    actions [tort versus contract], thereby reducing the significance of the existence
    of the two different forms of action”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    I agree with Tzimas J.’s observation, at para. 99 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>On their face, the statutes take different approaches to
    waivers. This is so because they have very different legislative purposes. Waivers
    in the OLA are designed to shield occupiers. The rejection of waivers in the CPA
    is designed to shield consumers. A conflict in the application of both statutes
    arises when consumers clash with suppliers who are also occupiers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, despite Mr. Schnarr’s and Ms. Woodhouse’s best efforts to advance the
    contrary proposition, there can be no reasonable conclusion other than that the
    two statutes conflict when one attempts to apply them to occupiers under the <em>OLA</em> who also happen to be suppliers under the <em>CPA</em>. Simply put, under the <em>OLA</em>,
    an occupier can obtain a waiver of liability (within limits as defined by the
    common law)<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> from any person coming onto their premises. However, that same occupier, if
    they are also a supplier under the <em>CPA</em>, cannot obtain an equivalent
    waiver. This, despite the fact that the factual foundation for both tort and
    contract causes of action are the same. A plain reading of the amended
    statements of claim allows for no other conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the instant appeals amply demonstrate, the result is a clear conflict. On the
    one hand, Blue Mountain and Snow Valley have lawful waivers that would exclude
    their liability for the injuries suffered by Mr. Schnarr and Ms. Woodhouse,
    respectively, and yet they are told that those waivers are of no effect by
    virtue of the <em>CPA</em>. It is of no practical comfort to Blue Mountain and
    Snow Valley to be told that their waivers protect them from the negligence
    claims but not from the warranty claims. The result for the ski resorts is the
    same. They will be held liable for something that they thought they had
    lawfully protected themselves against. In my view, such a result is both a
    direct contradiction and an absurd result.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles of statutory interpretation urge an approach that allows both

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will discuss each in turn.</p>
  <h4>Class of things</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    9(1) of the <em>OLA</em> provides that the statute does not restrict the
    imposition of a higher liability or standard of care upon occupiers. It
    provides innkeepers, common carriers, and bailees as examples of where a higher
    liability or standard of care would apply even if those classes of persons are simultaneously
    occupiers. The class of persons is not exhaustive in s. 9(1). However, in my
    view, the type of situations that would impose a “special liability or
    standards of care” on occupiers under s. 9(1) should be read <em>ejusdem
    generis</em> and be restricted to situations that are similar to the enumerated
    examples.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the situations in which Ontario courts have imposed a higher standard of care
    upon an occupier are squarely analogous to the enumerated classes in s. 9(1).
    For example, in <em>Miaskowski (Litigation guardian of) v. Persaud</em>, 2015
    ONCA 758, 393 D.L.R. (4th) 237, at para. 40, this court held that occupiers who
    are also landlords remain subject to the duties imposed on landlords under the <em>Residential
    Tenancies Act, 2006</em>, S.O. 2006, c. 17. And in <em>Miller v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, 2015 ONSC 669, at para. 24, Leach J. held that the
    Crown’s duty to take reasonable and adequate measures to protect an inmate from
    a reasonably foreseeable risk of injury and predictable dangers supplemented
    the Crown’s duties under the <em>OLA</em> as an owner and occupier of
    penitentiaries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CPA</em> does not purport to apply a special liability or higher standard
    of care for actions that are incidental to the role of an occupier. Rather, the <em>CPA</em> seeks to regulate the entirely separate category of consumer
    transactions between a supplier and consumer. As such, reading the section
    pursuant to the principle of <em>ejusdem generis</em>, it is clear that the
    application of any special liabilities or higher standards imposed by the <em>CPA</em> were not meant to be preserved under s. 9(1) of the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <h4>Express mention</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    alluded to above, the fact that s. 2(2) of the <em>CPA</em> and its subordinate
    regulations do not include the <em>OLA</em> in its prescribed list of
    exemptions is not the end of the matter. The interpretive rule that the express
    mention of one thing means the implied exclusion of another is rebuttable, and
    has not been accepted by the courts where the proposed interpretation disregards
    the underlying objectives of the statute: <em>Copthorne Holdings Ltd. v. Canada</em>,
    2011 SCC 63, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 721, at para. 111. Indeed, this court has cautioned
    against overreliance on the maxim: <em>Fleming v. Massey</em>, 2016 ONCA 70,
    128 O.R. (3d) 401, at paras. 41-43.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these appeals, there is no evidence in the record that in drafting the <em>CPA</em> and the <em>OLA</em>, the Legislature turned its mind to the interplay of these
    two statutes. There is no basis for expecting an express reference to the <em>OLA</em> in the <em>CPA</em>’s exemptions. As such, there is little value to the <em>expressio
    unius</em> argument in these appeals and it provides no basis to infer that the
    Legislature intended for the <em>CPA</em> to supersede the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <h4>Exhaustiveness</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    mentioned above, the <em>OLA</em> was a statutory scheme that replaced the
    common law with respect to occupiers’ liability. Significantly, it replaced the
    different common law standards of care applicable to entrants on premises (including
    contractual entrants) with a single, unified statutory duty to take reasonable
    care to see that entrants and their property are reasonably safe on the
    occupiers’ premises. Furthermore, the <em>OLA</em> expressly allows for the
    restriction, modification, or exclusion of the statutory duty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the <em>OLA</em> was therefore intended to be an exhaustive scheme at
    least in relation to the liability of occupiers to entrants on their premises flowing
    from the maintenance or care of the premises. The very purpose of this
    legislative scheme would be undermined if the <em>CPA</em> were allowed to
    reintroduce another novel contractual duty that purports to subject occupiers
    to an obligation to warrant that their premises are of a “reasonably acceptable
    quality”. As such, the fact that s. 9 of the <em>CPA</em> undermines the very
    purpose of the <i>OLA</i> is a factor that militates towards holding that the <i>OLA</i> supersedes the <em>CPA</em>.</p>
  <h4>Specific overrules general</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    appreciate that determining whether legislation is general or specific can be a
    difficult, and perhaps a somewhat theoretical, exercise. Indeed, it may very
    well be driven by the vantage point of the observer who is asked to make the
    determination. The arguments made by the parties in these appeals reflect that
    divergence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, in this factual situation, the <em>OLA</em> must be reasonably seen
    as dealing directly with the core issue, that is, the ability of occupiers of
    premises to obtain waivers of liability. In contrast, the <em>CPA</em> deals
    generally with all forms of consumer transactions. Buying a ski pass is but one
    of a myriad of consumer transactions to which the <em>CPA</em> could apply. The <em>OLA</em>, on the other hand, deals directly, and substantially, with
    activities on premises (as defined), including the operation of recreational
    activities on premises. Indeed, as I have explained above, part of the
    rationale for permitting occupiers to obtain waivers of liability was to
    promote the use of their properties by others for those very activities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adopting
    this approach does not invalidate the <em>CPA</em> or otherwise render it of no
    force or effect. Rather, this result simply recognizes that the <em>OLA</em> carves out consumer transactions that relate to activities covered by the <em>OLA</em> from the application of the <em>CPA</em>. Put another way, to the extent that
    an occupier engages with members of the public for the use of the occupier’s
    premises in return for payment, and thus creates a consumer agreement, the
    provisions of the <em>CPA</em> do not apply to that agreement. At the same
    time, insofar as parties who are occupiers engage with members of the public
    and create consumer transactions that do not relate to “persons entering on
    premises or the property brought on the premises by those persons” (<em>OLA</em>,
    s. 2), then the <em>CPA</em> would still apply to those consumer transactions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    result is consistent with the approach taken in <em>R. v. Greenwood</em> (1992),
    7 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 260 where, in commenting on the
    application of the principle of <em>generalia specialibus non derogant</em>, Griffiths
    J.A. said, at p. 266:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Applying this maxim of construction, the provisions of the
    special statute are not construed as repealing the general statute, but as
    providing an exception to the general.</p>
  <h4>Avoiding absurdity</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application of the principle that the specific overrules the general, along
    with the exhaustiveness principle in these appeals is also consistent with the
    objective of avoiding an absurdity, which is what I view the positions adopted
    by the motion judges below to result in. It is clear that one of the purposes
    of the <em>OLA</em> was to provide protection to occupiers who permitted persons
    to come onto their lands for the purpose of recreational activities. The result
    of the decisions below is that one of the fundamental purposes of the <em>OLA</em> is defeated, not through an intentional amendment to the <em>OLA</em>, but
    through an interpretation of the <em>CPA</em> that results in an indirect and
    implied amendment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am reinforced in my conclusion in this regard by the actions of the Legislature
    in 2016 when it enacted the <em>Ontario's Trails Act, 2016</em>, S.O. 2016, c.
    8, Sched. 1. This legislation, among other things, amended the <em>OLA</em> to
    provide protection to occupiers who permitted their premises to be used by
    members of the public for recreational trails, including hiking, portaging, or
    snowmobiling trails. These amendments resulted from concerns expressed by landowners
    of being exposed to liability as a result of allowing access to trails on their
    land. Volunteer non-profit clubs and associations taking care of those trails
    also voiced similar concerns.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport explained the purpose of the legislation
    at the time that it was being debated. He said, in part:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>One of the key pieces to this legislation is increasing the
    number of trail users by adding clarity to the Occupiers’ Liability Act. That’s
    an important piece that we think needs to be put in place here in Ontario. We
    know that trail tourism in the province of Ontario is part of a larger tourism
    sector in the province, which is a $28-billion; sector.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>[…]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Currently there exists some legal ambiguity around what
    standard of care is owed to the users of trails. For example, if an ATV club
    charges membership fees for coordinating rides on a portion of an Ontario trail
    network, it is legally questionable what level of care is required from the
    business and from the owner of the trail. If Bill 100 is passed, it will
    clarify legislation, encouraging further participation between businesses and
    the owners of trails.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is difficult to accept that the Legislature went through the exercise of
    amending the <em>OLA</em> for the purpose of clarifying the liability of
    occupiers, and to encourage them to open their property for use by members of
    the public, all to have it rendered of no force or effect because of the
    existence of the <em>CPA</em>. Indeed, the fact that the Legislature, in this
    instance, amended the <em>OLA</em> to address liability issues surrounding the
    recreational use of property, with no mention of or reference to the <em>CPA</em>,
    strikes me as clear evidence that the Legislature did not view the <em>CPA</em> as having any role to play in this area.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conclusion that the <em>CPA</em> does not operate within the sphere of
    activities governed by the <em>OLA</em> does not undercut the effectiveness of
    the <em>CPA</em>, nor does it offend public policy. Rather, it allows for the
    commercial flexibility necessary to promote the goal of encouraging landowners
    to permit their premises to be used for recreational activities. This objective
    was noted by the Supreme Court in <em>BG Checo</em>,<i> </i>where La Forest and
    McLachlin JJ. said, at p. 27:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This principle is of great importance in preserving a sphere of
    individual liberty and commercial flexibility. Thus if a person wishes to
    engage in a dangerous sport, the person may stipulate in advance that he or she
    waives any right of action against the person who operates the sport facility: <i>Dyck
    v. Manitoba Snowmobile Association Inc., </i>[1985] 1 S.C.R. 589.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that, in <em>Dyck</em>, the court held that there were no grounds of
    public policy that would lead to the striking down of a waiver of claims clause.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conclusion also does not offend the principle that consumer protection
    legislation should be interpreted generously. That principle only applies where
    the legislation operates validly. It does not apply to expand the jurisdiction
    of consumer protection legislation to occupy an area that is already covered by
    other specific legislation. Decisions such as <em>Seidel v. TELUS
    Communications Inc</em><i>.</i>, 2011 SCC 15, [2011] 1 S.C.R. 531 and <em>Weller
    v. Reliance Home Comfort Limited Partnership</em>, 2012 ONCA 360, 110 O.R. (3d)
    743 do not assist in determining the central point at issue in these appeals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    this conclusion is also consistent with the principle that broad language in
    legislation may be given a restricted interpretation where necessary in order
    to avoid an absurdity. As Blair J.A. said in <em>Blue Mountain Resorts Ltd. v.
    Bok</em>, 2013 ONCA 75, 114 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is also consistent with the principle that broad language in
    a statute may be given a somewhat restricted interpretation where necessary in
    order to avoid absurdity and to give the words their appropriate meaning,
    having regard to their context, the purpose of the Act, and the intention of
    the Legislature.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    such, I would conclude that ss. 7 and 9 of the <em>CPA</em> do not operate to
    void otherwise valid waivers executed under s. 3(3) of the <em>OLA</em>.</p>
  <h3>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Does s. 93(2) of the <i>CPA</i> allow a court to hold a consumer bound to a voided waiver under s. 9(3)?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Woodhouse’s appeal raises a separate issue with respect to McCarthy J.’s
    conclusion that s. 93(2) of the <em>CPA</em> might be used as a mechanism to
    hold a consumer to a waiver of liability, even if s. 9(3) of the <em>CPA</em> voided
    the waiver. While Tzimas J. did not make any direct finding on this issue, I
    believe a fair reading of her reasons suggests that she reached the opposite
    conclusion. While it is technically unnecessary for me to address this issue in
    light of my conclusions above, I will deal with it for the sake of
    completeness, especially since the issue was fully argued by the parties. I
    believe that the issue can be dealt with briefly.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    93 of the <em>CPA</em> reads:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1) A consumer agreement is not binding on the consumer unless
    the agreement is made in accordance with this Act and the regulations.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) Despite subsection (1), a court may order that a consumer
    is bound by all or a portion or portions of a consumer agreement, even if the
    agreement has not been made in accordance with this Act or the regulations, if
    the court determines that it would be inequitable in the circumstances for the
    consumer not to be bound.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that the court could rely on s. 93(2) to hold a consumer to a waiver
    of liability, notwithstanding that such waiver would be void under s. 9 of the <em>CPA</em>,
    McCarthy J. said, at para. 43 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I conclude therefore, that in situations where a consumer
    agreement contains terms or acknowledgments rendered presumptively void by
    operation of s. 9(3) and where the parties cannot agree to sever those
    offending terms from the consumer agreement under s. 9(4), the court may
    exercise its jurisdiction to sever the offending terms of the consumer
    agreement. It may do so as part of its s. 93(2) inquiry into whether it would
    be inequitable in the circumstances for the consumer not to be bound by the
    original agreement, including those terms and acknowledgments that would be
    void but for the equitable jurisdiction of the court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the motion judge erred in so concluding. The purpose behind s. 93(2)
    is to avoid situations where a consumer, who has received the benefit of a consumer
    agreement, attempts to retain those benefits without performing his or her side
    of the agreement because of a technical breach of the <em>CPA</em>. Section
    93(2) is not intended to permit the court to hold a consumer to a consumer
    agreement that violates one of the basic tenets of the <em>CPA</em>, especially
    when the provision is void.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that regard, it is important to observe, and give effect to, the exact wording
    of s. 9(3) of the <em>CPA</em>. It reads:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Any term or acknowledgement, whether part of the consumer
    agreement or not, that purports to negate or vary any implied condition or
    warranty under the <i>Sale of Goods Act</i> or any deemed condition or warranty
    under this Act is void.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    points can be taken from that wording. One is that it applies to any term or
    acknowledgment whether it is part of the consumer agreement or not. Thus, s.
    9(3) has a very broad reach. It is clear that it was intended to catch any
    attempt to negate or vary the deemed warranty provided by s. 9(1) of the <em>CPA</em>,
    even if the attempt is outside of the consumer agreement itself. The other is
    that s. 9(3) renders any such term or acknowledgement void. A term that is void
    is a term that is a nullity. It is different in kind from a term that is
    voidable. A term that is void has no legal force or effect and there is nothing
    to be saved by a curative provision: <em>Price v. Turnbull’s Grove Inc</em><i>.</i>,
    2007 ONCA 408, 85 O.R. (3d) 641, at paras. 34-37.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adopting
    a purposive interpretation of the <em>CPA</em>, there is nothing that would
    suggest that the Legislature intended that, notwithstanding the direct language
    used in s. 9(3), courts would be able to hold a consumer to a waiver of the deemed
    warranty provided by s. 9(1) of the <em>CPA</em>. Indeed, it would be hard to
    conceive of a factual situation where it would be equitable to do so in light
    of the fundamental purpose of the <em>CPA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude therefore that s. 93(2) cannot be used to give effect to a waiver that
    is voided by s. 9(3) of the <em>CPA</em>.</p>
