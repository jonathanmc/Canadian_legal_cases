  <p class=Onappealfrom><b>Hourigan J.A.:</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>This appeal concerns the
    interpretation of the </span><em>Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
    Act</em><i><span style='line-height:200%'>,</span></i><span style='line-height:
200%'> R.S.C. 1985, c. 30 (4th Supp.) (the “</span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>”). At issue is whether the motion judge erred in
    finding that funds subject to an American court order constituted proceeds of
    crime and were thereby subject to enforcement under the </span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the motion judge correctly
    concluded that the funds are proceeds of crime under the </span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>In 2010, an American jury convicted the
    appellant of conspiracy and fraud. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered
    to pay both restitution and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $26
    million USD, representing his interest in the property derived from the
    proceeds of his offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>In 2012, American authorities discovered an
    account in the name of Brent David Emanuel at a branch of the Royal Bank of
    Canada (“RBC”) in Milton, Ontario, containing $9.2 million CAD, believed to
    belong to the appellant. On September 21, 2012, Justice Kelly of the U.S.
    District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued an order
    restraining the funds in the RBC account as substitute assets (the “Kelly
    Order”) until further order of that court. It was issued on the basis that the
    $26 million forfeiture money judgment against the appellant remained
    outstanding and the property derived from the proceeds of his offences could
    not be located.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>Under the American </span><em>Federal
    Rules of Criminal Procedure,</em><span style='line-height:200%'> a forfeiture
    order for the proceeds of crime may be extended to include “substitute property”
    if the property subject to the forfeiture order cannot be located or has been
    transferred to third parties. Therefore, pursuant to American law, the American
    government was entitled to seek forfeiture of any assets belonging to the
    appellant in satisfaction of the forfeiture money judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>American authorities then requested
    Canada’s assistance in enforcing the Kelly Order. On September 24, 2012, Forestell
    J. authorized the Kelly Order to be filed and entered as a judgment of the
    Ontario Superior Court of Justice pursuant to ss. 9.3(1) and (2) of the </span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. Under s. 9.3(4)(d) of the </span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, she ordered that the Kelly Order could be enforced
    as if it were made under s. 490.8(3) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. Both s. 9.3(4)(d) of the </span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> and s. 490.8(3) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><i><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>apply to
    “offence-related property”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>In September 2016, the appellant moved to
    set aside Forestell J.’s order, arguing that the court had no jurisdiction to
    file and enter the Kelly Order under s. 9.3 of the </span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> because the funds in the RBC account do not
    constitute offence-related property or proceeds of crime. Rather, he argued
    that these funds were the proceeds of a legitimate business transaction and
    were being held by Mr. Emanuel in trust for his mother.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>In February 2017, the respondent moved to
    have the appellant’s motion summarily dismissed on the basis that it was
    frivolous or vexatious. It is the result of that motion that is at issue on
    this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Decision Below</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The motion judge granted the respondent’s
    motion for summary dismissal. She held that the appellant’s motion to set aside
    Forestell J.’s order “has no chance of success in fact or in law”. She noted
    that s. 9.3(1) of the </span><em>Act</em><span style='line-height:200%'> applies to the enforcement of “an order for the restraint or seizure of
    property situated in Canada” and that it was not, on its face, restricted to
    orders in respect of proceeds of crime or offence-related property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>However, she held that she did not need to decide that
    issue because in her view, the phrase “proceeds of crime” in s. 9.3(4)(b) of
    the </span><em>Act</em><i><span style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span
style='line-height:200%'>was broad enough to encompass the Kelly Order. The
    motion judge found that the RBC funds were proceeds of crime because they had
    been substituted for proceeds of crime by a foreign state under its
    legislation. Therefore, substituting s. 462.33(3) of the </span><em>Code</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> (referred to in s. 9.3(4)(b) of the </span><em>Act</em><i><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>and dealing
    with proceeds of crime)<i> </i>for the section originally cited in Forestell J.’s
    order (s. 490.8(3), referred to in s. 9.3(4)(d) of the </span><em>Act</em><i><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span style='line-height:200%'>and dealing
    with offence-related property) resolved any issue of jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The motion judge also rejected the appellant’s
    argument that the order of Forestell J. was issued on the basis of material
    misrepresentations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>On June 21, 2017, Brown J.A. of this court granted leave
    to appeal the order of Molloy J., pursuant to s. 35 of the </span><em>Act</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. In granting leave to appeal, Brown J.A. stated the
    legal issue in this appeal as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Does an Order under the US <em>Federal Rules of Criminal
    Procedure</em> to restrain “substitute assets” for satisfaction of a forfeiture
    order constitute an “order for the restraint or seizure of property situated in
    Canada” within the meaning of s. 9.3(1) of the <em>Act</em> and for an order to
    restrain the proceeds of crime or offence-related property within the meaning
    of ss. 9.3(4)(b) and (d) of the <em>Act</em>?</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The respondent argues that the funds in the RBC
    account do not need to be proceeds of crime or offence-related property to be
    subject to restraint under the </span><em>Act</em><span style='line-height:
200%'>. It submits that under s. 9(3)(2), a Canadian court must file the order
    if the preconditions under ss. 9.3(1) and 9.3(3) are met. Because these
    preconditions have been met in this case, it does not matter whether the funds
    are proceeds of crime or offence-related property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The respondent also submits that the appellant does
    not have standing to oppose the registration of the Kelly Order, given his
    position that the funds in issue are not his property.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is unnecessary to deal with either of these issues. <span
style='line-height:200%'>This appeal can be decided on the narrow question of
    whether the motion judge erred in finding that the funds qualified as proceeds
    of crime under s. 9.3(4)(b) of the </span><em>Act</em><span style='line-height:
200%'>. I turn now to that issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The starting point of the analysis is the text of s. 9.3
    of the </span><em>Act</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, which provides as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>9.3 (1) When a written request is presented to the
    Minister by a state or entity, other than the International Criminal Court
    referred to in section 9.1, for the enforcement of an order for the restraint
    or seizure of property situated in Canada issued by a court of criminal
    jurisdiction of the state or entity, the Minister may authorize the Attorney General
    of Canada or an attorney general of a province to make arrangements for the
    enforcement of the order.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) On receipt of an authorization, the Attorney
    General of Canada or an attorney general of a province may file a copy of the
    order with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction of the province in which
    the property that is the subject of the order is believed to be located. On
    being filed, the order shall be entered as a judgment of that court and may be
    executed anywhere in Canada.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(3) Before filing an order, the Attorney General of
    Canada or an attorney general of a province must be satisfied that</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) the person has been charged with an offence
    within the jurisdiction of the state or entity; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) the offence would be an indictable offence if
    it were committed in Canada.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(4) On being filed,</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) an order for the seizure of proceeds of crime
    may be enforced as if it were a warrant issued under subsection 462.32(1) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) an order for the restraint of proceeds of
    crime may be enforced as if it were an order made under subsection 462.33(3) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>;</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(c) an order for the seizure of offence-related
    property may be enforced as if it were a warrant issued under subsection 487(1)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em> or subsection 11(1) of the <em>Controlled Drugs
    and Substances Act</em>, as the case may be; and</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(d) an order for the restraint of offence-related
    property may be enforced as if it were an order made under subsection 490.8(3)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em> or subsection 14(3) of the <em>Controlled Drugs
    and Substances Act</em>, as the case may be.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the $9 million at issue in this case is not proceeds of
    crime or offence-related property. The <span style='line-height:200%'>Kelly
    Order</span> provided for the restraint of these funds as legitimate
    non-criminal assets because the American government had been unable to collect
    against the appellant on a money judgment for the value of the proceeds of
    crime. Therefore, the appellant argues that the <span style='line-height:200%'>Kelly
    Order</span> was issued to collect an unpaid money judgment, not to restrain
    proceeds of any crime. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the appellant’s submission that ss. 9.3(4)(a) to (d) of the <em>Act</em> stipulate that only filed orders for the seizure or restraint of proceeds of
    crime and of offence-related property can be enforced pursuant to s. 9.3. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the appellant argues that in interpreting s. 9.3 of the <em>Act</em>, the definition
    of proceeds of crime found under s. 462.3(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>should
    be applied. That definition refers to property “obtained or derived directly or
    indirectly” from the commission of an indictable offence. Adopting this
    definition, the appellant submits, would be consistent with the purpose of the <i>Act</i>.
    Moreover, he argues that it would be contrary to common sense and public policy
    for proceeds of crime that can be restrained or seized under the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> to be narrower than property that can be restrained pursuant to a
    foreign order under the <em>Act</em>. This would give foreign states a more
    extensive restraint and seizure power in Canada than the Canadian government. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the appropriate procedure would have been to instead
    commence civil proceedings to collect the Kelly Order pursuant to ss. 9(1) to (3)
    of the <em>Act</em>, but that did not occur.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to any of these submissions, for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> First,
    domestic legislation that has been enacted to implement Canada’s international
    obligations should be interpreted broadly and purposively with the aim of
    fulfilling those obligations: <em>National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Import
    Tribunal)</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, at 1371. Thus, where a court is faced
    with two possible interpretations of a statute implementing Canada’s
    international obligations, the interpretation that allows Canada to fulfill
    those obligations will be preferred: <em>R. v. Hape</em>, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2
    S.C.R. 292, at para. 53; <em>R. v. Appulonappa</em>, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3
    S.C.R. 754, at para. 40.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has adopted this approach to statutory interpretation in the
    transnational law context in its consideration of the proper application of the <em>Act</em><i>:</i> <em>Canada (Attorney General) v. Ni-Met Resources Inc.</em> (2005), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 19; <em>Canada (Attorney
    General) v. Foster</em> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 59 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 57; <em>Belgium
    v. Suthanthiran</em>, 2017 ONCA 343, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 120, at para. 62, leave to
    appeal refused: [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 256.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in the transnational law context, due regard must be had to differences in
    foreign legal concepts. For example, in <em>France v. Diab</em>, 2014 ONCA 374,
    120 O.R. (3d) 174, leave to appeal refused: [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 317, this court
    adopted a broad and purposive interpretation of the requirement that a person
    who is being extradited is “sought for the purpose of prosecution” by the
    foreign state under the <em>Extradition Act</em>, S.C.1999, c.18. This court
    held that the test for whether a person is sought for prosecution is whether
    the authorities in the foreign state have taken a step that can fairly be
    described as the commencement of a prosecution in that state. It did not
    require a strictly Canadian understanding of the concept, which would require
    formal charges to be laid: see paras. 165-177. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the phrase “proceeds of crime” should be interpreted in a
    manner that respects differences in legal systems. Rule 32.2(e)(1)(B) of the
    American <em>Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</em> permits the American government
    to enter an order of forfeiture or to amend an existing order of forfeiture to
    include property that is “substitute property that qualifies for forfeiture
    under an applicable statute”. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 853(p), as incorporated
    by 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c), where, <em>inter alia</em>, property of a defendant
    cannot be located or has been transferred to a third party, a court shall order
    the forfeiture of substitute property. The effect of these provisions is that the
    American government is entitled as a matter of law in such circumstances to
    seek the forfeiture of any assets belonging to a defendant in satisfaction of
    the forfeiture money judgment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a policy choice made by the American government, and as its treaty partner, Canada
    should respect that choice. It would violate the principle of comity and
    Canada’s treaty obligations for Canada to insist that it will only assist a
    treaty partner where the foreign criminal law provision mirrors the domestic
    Canadian criminal law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    a broad definition of proceeds of crime accords with the purposes of the <em>Act</em>.
    At its essence, the <em>Act</em> has a dual purpose. It provides for assistance
    to other states in furtherance of Canada’s treaty obligations and it ensures
    that those states will in turn provide Canada with assistance when necessary to
    investigate crimes in which Canada has an interest:<i> <em>Foster</em></i>, at
    para. 55.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, interpreting proceeds of crime in a restrictive manner that only
    accords with the Canadian criminal law definition of this term would frustrate
    rather than support these objectives. Imposing the limits of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em><i> </i>definition on foreign orders would undermine Canada’s ability
    to cooperate with other states and prevent the government from honouring its
    treaty obligations. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed. In accordance with the respondent’s request, no costs are
    awarded.</p>
