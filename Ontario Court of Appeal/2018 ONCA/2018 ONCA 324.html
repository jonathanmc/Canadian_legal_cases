  <p class=Judge><strong>BROWN J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:
none'>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns whether the failure to disclose immediately an
    agreement between or amongst parties to a lawsuit that converts their
    adversarial relationship into a co-operative one ordinarily should result in
    the stay of the non-disclosing party’s claim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this 2009 action, the plaintiff entered into litigation agreements
    with one of the defendants, H&amp;M Combustion Services Ltd. (“H&amp;M”). Under
    the 2011 agreement, H&amp;M agreed to defend the action and commence a third
    party claim, which the plaintiff would fund. Under the 2016 agreement, H&amp;M
    assigned all its interest in the lawsuit to the plaintiff, who indemnified
    H&amp;M from any exposure in the litigation and undertook to prosecute the
    third party claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither the plaintiff nor H&amp;M disclosed the agreements to the other
    parties immediately upon their execution. They were disclosed in a piecemeal
    fashion throughout 2016. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the defendants, Geo. Williamson Fuels Ltd. (“Williamson”), moved
    to stay the action on the basis that the plaintiff and H&amp;M had failed to
    comply with the obligation of immediate disclosure set out in the decision of
    this court in <em>Aecon Buildings v. Stephenson Engineering Limited</em>, 2010
    ONCA 898, 328 D.L.R. (4th) 488, leave to appeal refused, [2011] S.C.C.A. No. 84.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge held that the 2011 and 2016 litigation agreements
    should have been disclosed. However, he refused to stay the action concluding,
    in effect, that the late disclosure of the agreements had not caused Williamson
    any prejudice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Williamson appeals. I would grant the appeal. Having found that the
    agreements were of the type requiring immediate disclosure under the principles
    set out in <em>Aecon</em>, the motion judge erred in principle by failing to
    apply the remedy for such non-disclosure specified in <em>Aecon</em> – staying
    the claim of the non-disclosing party.</p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:
none'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>II.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE HISTORY OF THE LITIGATION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2004, Helen Handley bought a new outdoor oil tank for her residence. She
    alleged that in 2007 she discovered that it had leaked, discharging several
    hundred litres of fuel oil into the surrounding soil. This litigation ensued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2009, Ms. Handley’s insurer, Aviva Insurance Company of Canada (“Aviva”),
    commenced this subrogated claim in the name of Ms. Handley against those
    involved: (i) in the sale and installation of the oil tank – DTE Industries
    Limited (“DTE”) and H&amp;M; and (ii) in the delivery of fuel oil to the tank –
    Williamson and Ultramar Ltd. Since this is a subrogated claim, I will refer to
    Aviva as if it were the plaintiff throughout these reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The 2011 Litigation Agreement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H&amp;M had been dissolved in 2007. Aviva was aware of that fact; the
    statement of claim pleaded it. As well, H&amp;M was not insured.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva
    had not named as defendants in the main action one of the oil tank vendors in
    the supply chain, Kawartha Lakes HVAC Inc. (“Kawartha Lakes”), and its
    corporate successors, Don Park Inc. and SLM Toronto Inc. By the time it decided
    to sue Kawartha Lakes, the limitation period for the main action had expired.
    Aviva decided to explore initiating a third party claim against Kawartha Lakes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Starting
    in the spring of 2011, as the deadline for issuing a third party claim approached,
    counsel for Aviva and H&amp;M discussed striking a litigation agreement. Under
    the resulting August 10, 2011 agreement amongst Aviva, H&amp;M, and H&amp;M’s
    principal, Jim Richards (the “2011 Litigation Agreement”), Aviva agreed to
    provide financial support to H&amp;M to prosecute a third party claim. The key
    terms of the agreement were that:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(i)      H&amp;M
    would defend the main action and commence the third party claim;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(ii)      Aviva
    would contribute $5,000 to cover H&amp;M’s costs of prosecuting the third party
    claim through the examinations for discovery;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(iii)     Richards
    would revive H&amp;M should that be necessary to prosecute the third party
    claim; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(iv)     All
    communications between counsel for Aviva and H&amp;M pertaining to the
    prosecution of the third party claim would be subject to common-interest privilege.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 24, 2011, H&amp;M filed its statement of defence and cross-claim and
    issued the third party claim against Kawartha Lakes and its successors. H&amp;M
    cross-claimed against Williamson, and Williamson cross-claimed against H&amp;M.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time, neither Aviva nor H&amp;M disclosed the 2011 Litigation Agreement to
    the other parties. Disclosure was not made until the fall of 2016.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The 2016 Litigation Agreement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    litigation moved slowly ahead. In May 2012, the third parties delivered
    statements of defence to the main action and third party action. They then sought
    security for costs from H&amp;M.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early 2013, H&amp;M agreed to post security of $20,000 for costs through
    discoveries. Aviva provided H&amp;M with the required funds, a fact not
    disclosed to the other parties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Examinations
    for discovery were conducted throughout 2013 and 2014.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 2016, the third parties proposed a settlement to H&amp;M, which
    forwarded the proposal to Aviva’s counsel advising it would await Aviva’s
    direction before responding. In the result, H&amp;M rejected the settlement
    proposal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    late February 2016, the third parties scheduled a motion to: (i) amend their
    defence to plead the expiration of the limitation period by reason of H&amp;M’s
    status as a dissolved corporation; and (ii) increase the security for costs
    posted by H&amp;M.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early March, the court assigned a November 2016 trial date.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    activity led Aviva and H&amp;M to conclude a further litigation agreement on
    March 7, 2016 (the “2016 Litigation Agreement”), which was in two parts: (i) a letter;
    and (ii) an e-mail. Under the 2016 Litigation Agreement:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H&amp;M assigned to Aviva all its rights in the action, including the
    rights to receive all proceeds from the third party claim;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva agreed to indemnify H&amp;M and Richards against all costs and
    damages that might be awarded against H&amp;M;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva would assume responsibility for defending H&amp;M and prosecuting
    its third party claim;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva assumed responsibility for all reasonable costs and disbursements
    incurred by H&amp;M’s counsel but reserved the right to appoint its own
    counsel; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties would disclose the assignment to the other parties if
    required by law or reasonably necessary in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, for all intents and purposes Aviva stepped into the litigation shoes
    of H&amp;M.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The slow disclosure of the litigation agreements</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 7, 2016, counsel for H&amp;M advised the third parties that Aviva had
    undertaken to pay any costs assessed against H&amp;M. No further disclosure of
    the terms of the 2011 and 2016 Litigation Agreements was made. However, that
    limited disclosure resolved the third parties’ motion for security for costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in March, counsel for Williamson made an overture to H&amp;M to jointly retain
    a damages expert. H&amp;M declined, disclosing it had assigned its rights in
    the third party proceeding to the plaintiff and that “the interest of both the
    Plaintiff and H&amp;M are aligned”. At the end of March, Aviva’s counsel sent the
    other parties a copy of the part of the 2016 Litigation Agreement contained in
    the letter; the part contained in the e-mail was not sent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further
    correspondence ensued in April and May 2016, with counsel for the third parties
    pointing out to Aviva its obligation to disclose immediately any litigation
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early August 2016, Aviva produced the 2016 Litigation Agreement; the 2011 one
    was not disclosed. Yet more correspondence amongst counsel ensued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third parties moved to adjourn the trial and compel the delivery by Aviva and
    H&amp;M of a further affidavit of documents containing a Schedule B that
    particularized the documents over which privilege was claimed. Aviva’s counsel
    thereupon delivered a proper affidavit of documents, which identified on
    Schedule B the 2011 and 2016 Litigation Agreements. The third parties’ motion
    settled, with Aviva and H&amp;M agreeing to produce the Schedule B documents
    and waive any common interest privilege. Aviva ultimately produced all the
    litigation agreements by late October 2016.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    that point, Williamson and the third parties moved for an order staying the
    action on the basis that Aviva and H&amp;M had failed to disclose immediately agreements
    that affected “the litigation landscape”, contrary to the principles set down
    by this court in <em>Aecon</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third party action settled on the eve of the motion hearing; only Williamson’s
    motion to stay proceeded. </p>
  <h1><span style='text-transform:
none'>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the motion judge, Aviva conceded the 2016 Litigation Agreement should have been
    disclosed immediately upon completion. However, it submitted the 2011
    Litigation Agreement was merely a funding agreement that did not require
    disclosure. The motion judge disagreed, holding that the 2011 Litigation Agreement
    did not maintain adversity between Aviva and H&amp;M and, therefore, should have
    been disclosed to all parties immediately upon completion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
    that finding, the motion judge refused Williamson’s request for a stay of the
    action. He distinguished <em>Aecon</em>. In his view, since the litigation
    agreement in <em>Aecon</em> was between the plaintiff and the sole defendant,
    and the stay granted affected only third and fourth party claims, <em>Aecon</em> did not stand for the proposition that the claims against all parties to the litigation
    should “automatically” be stayed: at paras. 44-45.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the motion judge drew on this court’s decision in <em>Abarca v. Vargas</em>,
    2015 ONCA 4, 123 O.R. (3d) 561, to hold that the principle of proportionality
    should inform the consideration of the remedy for the failure to disclose the
    2011 and 2016 Litigation Agreements. The motion judge appeared to conclude that
    Williamson suffered no prejudice from the delayed disclosure for two reasons:
    (i) as a supplier of the oil in the tank, and not the tank, Williamson was
    unaffected by the third party claim, which was against an entity in the tank
    supply chain (notwithstanding that H&amp;M and Williamson had cross-claimed
    against each other); and (ii) there was no reason for Williamson to spend money
    litigating the third party claim because H&amp;M had been a dissolved
    corporation throughout. In those circumstances, the motion judge concluded that
    a stay of the action against Williamson would not be an appropriate remedy.</p>

    the principle in <em>Aecon</em> is clear: where such an agreement is not

  <p class=Heading>The obligation of immediate disclosure</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    at least the 1993 decision in <em>Pettey v. Avis Car Inc.</em> (1993), 13 O.R.
    (3d) 725 (Gen. Div.), the law in Ontario has been clear that <em>Mary Carter-</em>type
    agreements<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> must be disclosed to the court and to the other parties to the lawsuit as soon
    as the agreement is made. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the 2009 decision in <em>Laudon v. Roberts</em>, 2009 ONCA 383, 249 O.A.C. 72,
    at para. 39, leave to appeal refused, [2009] S.C.C.A. No. 304, this court
    repeated the obligation to disclose such an agreement to the court and to the other
    parties to the lawsuit “as soon as it is concluded”. That disclosure
    obligation, and its rationale, were explained by this court at para. 39 of its
    reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The existence of a [<em>Mary Carter</em> agreement]
    significantly alters the relationship among the parties to the litigation. 
    Usually the position of the parties will have changed from those set out in
    their pleadings. It is for this reason that the existence of such an agreement
    is to be disclosed, as soon as it is concluded, to the court and to the other
    parties to the litigation.  The reason for this is well stated in [<em>Pettey</em>,
    at pp. 737-738]:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>The answer is obvious. The agreement must be disclosed to
    the parties and to the court as soon as the agreement is made.  <em>The
    non-contracting defendants must be advised immediately because the agreement
    may well have an impact on the strategy and line of cross-examination to be
    pursued and evidence to be led by them</em>.  The non-contracting parties must
    also be aware of the agreement so that they can properly assess the steps being
    taken from that point forward by the plaintiff and the contracting defendants.
    In short, procedural fairness requires immediate disclosure. <em>Most
    importantly, the court must be informed immediately so that it can properly
    fulfil its role in controlling its process in the interests of fairness and
    justice to all parties</em>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    year later in <em>Aecon</em>, this court considered an agreement between the
    plaintiff, Aecon, and the sole defendant, the City of Brampton, that capped the
    damages for which Brampton might be liable to Aecon. Those parties did not
    disclose their agreement to the third and fourth parties until several months
    after its conclusion. This court held that agreements which “change entirely
    the landscape of the litigation” must be disclosed immediately, stating, at para.
    13:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>We do not endorse the practice whereby such agreements are
    concluded between or among various parties to the litigation and are not
    immediately disclosed.  While it is open to parties to enter into such
    agreements, the obligation upon entering such an agreement is to <em>immediately</em> inform all other parties to the litigation as well as to the court … <span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>The reason for this is obvious. Such agreements
    change entirely the landscape of the litigation</span><em>.</em> [Italics in
    original and underlining added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Aecon</em>, the failure of the plaintiff and defendant to disclose
    immediately their litigation agreement led this court to stay the third and
    fourth party proceedings.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Litigation agreements covered by the obligation of immediate
    disclosure </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    obligation of immediate disclosure is not limited to pure <em>Mary Carter</em> or <em>Pierringer</em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></span></a> agreements. The disclosure obligation extends to any agreement between or
    amongst parties to a lawsuit that has the effect of changing the adversarial
    position of the parties set out in their pleadings into a co-operative one: <em>Aviaco
    International Leasing Inc. v. Boeing Canada Inc</em>. (2000), 9 B.L.R. (3d) 99 (Ont.
    S.C.), at para. 23. To maintain the fairness of the litigation process, the
    court needs to “know the reality of the adversity between the parties” and
    whether an agreement changes “the dynamics of the litigation” or the
    “adversarial orientation”: <em>Moore v. Bertuzzi</em>, 2012 ONSC 3248, 110 O.R.
    (3d) 611, at paras. 75-79.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Aviaco</em>, at para. 23, the court formulated the question to pose to
    ascertain whether an agreement triggers the immediate disclosure requirement: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Do the terms of the agreement alter the apparent relationships
    between any parties to the litigation that would otherwise be assumed from the
    pleadings or expected in the conduct of the litigation?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the motion judge rejected Aviva’s argument that the 2011 Litigation
    Agreement did not alter the adversarial orientation in the lawsuit between it
    and H&amp;M. Aviva does not challenge that finding, and properly so. Although
    the 2011 Litigation Agreement was not a “pure” <em>Mary Carter</em> agreement, and
    while the terms of the 2011 and 2016 Litigation Agreements were not identical
    to those in the agreement at issue in <em>Aecon</em>, nevertheless they shared
    the same essential element: they changed the relationship between two parties from
    an adversarial one into a co-operative one.<span style='line-height:200%'> As
    such, the 2011 and 2016 Litigation Agreements were ones that changed the
    litigation landscape.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The remedy for failing to disclose immediately an agreement
    that changes the litigation landscape</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aviva
    submits the <em>Aecon</em> decision did not lay down a general rule about the
    remedy a court should grant where a party’s conduct amounts to an abuse of
    process because the party failed to disclose immediately an agreement that
    changed the landscape of the litigation. <em>Aecon</em>, it contends, must be
    confined to its facts, which differ from those in the present case. Aviva
    contends that in any case where a court finds that a party has committed an
    abuse of process, the court must engage in a case-specific proportionality
    analysis to craft an appropriate remedy, as was done in the <em>Abarca</em> decision. Not to do so, Aviva argues, would ignore the flexible application of
    the doctrine of abuse of process articulated by cases such as <em>Toronto
    (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79</em>, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the <em>Abarca</em> case did not involve a litigation agreement and did not
    discuss the consequences of a failure to disclose immediately such an
    agreement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    contrast, <em>Aecon</em> squarely addressed the consequences that should flow
    from a specific kind of abuse of process – a party’s failure to disclose
    immediately an agreement that alters the adversarial posture of the litigation.
    Several clear messages emanate from <em>Aecon</em>: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The obligation of immediate disclosure of agreements that “change
    entirely the landscape of the litigation” is “clear and unequivocal” – they
    must be produced immediately upon their completion: at paras. 13 and 16;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The absence of prejudice does not excuse the late disclosure of such an
    agreement: at para. 16;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Any failure of compliance amounts to abuse of process and must result
    in consequences of the most serious nature for the defaulting party”: at para.
    16; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only remedy to redress the wrong of the abuse of process is to stay
    the claim asserted by the defaulting, non-disclosing party. Why? Because sound
    policy reasons support such an approach:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Only by imposing consequences of the most serious nature on the
    defaulting party is the court able to enforce and control its own process and
    ensure that justice is done between and among the parties. To permit the
    litigation to proceed without disclosure of agreements such as the one in issue
    renders the process a sham and amounts to a failure of justice: at para. 16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Aecon</em> identified the remedy for a specific kind of abuse of process. As a matter of litigation
    procedural policy, no unfairness is likely to arise from the application of the <em>Aecon</em> principles. At least one party to a litigation agreement usually
    is an insurer or other sophisticated litigation participant who should be well
    aware of the <em>Aecon</em> principles. Where such a sophisticated party fails
    to comply with its clear disclosure obligation, judicial time should not be
    spent on inquiring into what, if any, prejudice was caused by a breach of the party’s
    clear obligation (or, as argued by Aviva, whether the undisclosed litigation agreement
    somehow actually benefited the parties who knew nothing of its existence).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    if a party to a litigation agreement is unclear whether the agreement has the
    effect of changing the adversarial position of the contracting parties, thereby
    attracting the mandatory disclosure obligation, it is always open to the party
    to move before the court for directions. In that way, the court can enforce and
    control its own process and ensure that justice is done between and among the
    parties. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the motion judge misdirected himself regarding the principles in <em>Aecon</em>.
    He erred by failing to apply <em>Aecon’s</em> remedy of staying the claim of
    the party that did not immediately disclose a litigation agreement. Given that
    misdirection, his discretionary decision is not entitled to deference in the
    circumstances: <em>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass</em>,
    [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391, at para. 87. The motion judge should have applied <em>Aecon</em> and granted the stay Williamson requested.</p>
