  <h1><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants, the Better Business Bureau of
    Ottawa-Hull Incorporated/Bureau d’Ethique Commercial d’Ottawa-Hull Incorporée
    and Better Business Bureau of Ottawa-Hull Inc. (collectively the “BBB”), are
    part of a network of not-for-profit organizations of fee-paying members whose
    goals include investigating consumer complaints and promoting the reliability
    of businesses. Members are required to respond to consumer complaints made to
    the BBB; non-members may also do so and utilize the BBB’s mediation process.
    The BBB also provides ratings about businesses, which are posted on its
    website. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Barry Walsh controls the respondent company,
    Walsh Energy Inc. (“Walsh”), as well as Waltek Energy Services Inc. (“Waltek”).
    Both companies were plaintiffs in these proceedings, but only Walsh is a party
    to this appeal. Both Walsh and Waltek were members of the BBB until they
    resigned in 2007.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Shortly following their resignation, the BBB
    received a complaint from a Walsh customer, Mr. Fleischman. Walsh did not
    respond to the BBB concerning the complaint pursuant to the BBB protocol, nor
    did it resolve the complaint independently. As a result, the BBB changed Walsh’s
    website-posted rating from “satisfactory” to “unsatisfactory”. The posted rating
    included the information that it was the result of an unresolved consumer
    complaint. The rating appeared on the BBB website for approximately one year,
    until the BBB adopted a new rating system in January, 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The new rating system was designed by the BBB’s
    umbrella organization and the BBB was required to adopt it. The system operated
    using the umbrella organization’s proprietary software, which generated letter
    grades based on 17 factors considered by the BBB. The new ratings system generated
    a grade of B for Waltek and D- for Walsh, and these grades were posted on the
    BBB website.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Waltek and Walsh sued the BBB in defamation,
    claiming that the grades posted on the BBB website caused substantial damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that Waltek’s B grade was not
    a relatively lower grade than the former “neutral” rating it had been assigned,
    and if anything suggested that the company had improved. It was not defamatory.
    The trial judge found, further, that Walsh’s D- grade was not defamatory,
    stating that it was uncertain whether the grade was a diminution or an
    improvement over Walsh’s prior “unsatisfactory” rating. He rejected the
    argument that the grades of both companies suggested that they were
    untrustworthy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge went on to conclude that the
    ratings were protected by defences of qualified privilege and fair comment in
    any event, and that there was no evidence of malice. He concluded, further,
    that Waltek and Walsh had failed to prove special damages and that general
    damages of only $15,000 would have been appropriate had they established
    liability. The trial judge awarded the BBB approximately $348,000 in costs on a
    partial indemnity basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Waltek and Walsh appealed to the Divisional
    Court, but Waltek abandoned its appeal prior to the hearing. The Divisional
    Court allowed the Walsh appeal, concluding that the D- grade was defamatory and
    ordering a new trial on the issues of fair comment, malice, and damages. The
    Divisional Court also allowed the abandoned Waltek appeal and ordered a new
    trial on whether it had been defamed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties sought directions concerning the
    appropriate order and the Divisional Court provided supplementary reasons. The
    court noted the parties’ agreement to the following points:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Waltek’s claims were abandoned prior to argument
    of the appeal and should not be remitted for retrial;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Walsh’s claim for lost profits was not pursued
    on appeal and should not be remitted for retrial;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court had decided that the BBB’s impugned
    words were defamatory as against Walsh; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court had decided that the
    defence of qualified privilege was not available.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court held that issues of fair
    comment, malice, and damages other than lost profits should be remitted for
    determination by a new trial judge, who should have an unrestricted ability to
    make findings of credibility and fact, draw inferences, and determine the
    outstanding issues. The court held, further, that although it had found that the
    impugned words were defamatory, the precise defamatory meaning of the impugned
    words should be determined by the trial judge based on the record at the new
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The BBB appeals with leave of this court and
    raises several issues. The BBB submits that the Divisional Court erred by:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>concluding that the impugned publication was
    defamatory; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>concluding that the fair comment defence had not
    been established and ordering a new trial on the issue; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>concluding that the impugned publication was not
    made on an occasion of qualified privilege; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ordering a new trial on the question of malice;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>acting in a procedurally unfair manner on the
    question of damages; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ordering a new trial on the question of damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Walsh cross-appeals. It submits that the record
    before the Divisional Court was sufficient for it to substitute its own
    decision and seeks judgment against the BBB, including awards of general,
    special and punitive damages. In the alternative, in the event that the case is
    referred to a new trial, Walsh seeks a direction requiring the trial judge to
    determine whether the facts underlying the impugned publication were
    sufficiently known to readers such that the defence of fair comment is
    available. In the further alternative, in the event the BBB succeeds on its appeal,
    Walsh seeks a reduction in the costs awarded at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the Divisional Court did not err in
    determining that the impugned publication was defamatory. The Divisional Court did
    err, however, in ordering a new trial on the fair comment issue. The record is
    sufficient to permit this court to conclude that the test for fair comment is
    satisfied. With the exception of the issue of the costs at trial raised by Walsh,
    which I address at the end of these reasons, these conclusions are sufficient
    to dispose of the appeal and cross-appeal and there is no need to address the
    other issues raised. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Was the publication defamatory?</span></em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is no question in this case that the
    impugned words were published by the BBB and were “of and about” Walsh. The
    question was whether the D- grade was defamatory, in the sense that it would
    tend to lower Walsh’s reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person: <em>Grant
    v. Torstar Corp.</em>, 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640 at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that it was not. He
    considered that it was uncertain whether the D- grade was a diminution or an
    improvement over Walsh’s previous rating of “unsatisfactory”, and inferred that
    Walsh was content with the unsatisfactory rating because it did nothing about
    it. The trial judge found, further, that although the plural word “complaints”
    appeared on the BBB website, the website correctly stated that there was only
    one unresolved complaint. Moreover, there were disclaimers and explanations on
    the website that made clear that the accuracy of the ratings was not
    guaranteed. The trial judge rejected the inference the D- grade was an innuendo
    that Walsh was untrustworthy and does not respond to customer complaints. However,
    the trial judge did not address the pleading that this was also the plain and
    ordinary meaning of the grade.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The BBB submits that whether the D- grade was
    defamatory was a question of mixed fact and law and the trial judge’s decision
    was entitled to deference. Instead, the Divisional Court substituted its view, and
    in doing so adopted the worst possible meaning of the impugned words.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not agree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge’s conclusion was otherwise
    entitled to deference, the Divisional Court properly concluded that the trial
    judge erred in principle by failing to make a finding as to the plain and
    ordinary meaning of the grade. The focus of the trial judge’s analysis was on
    the context in which the grade was assigned and its connection to the prior
    “unsatisfactory” rating Walsh had received, as para. 25 of his decision makes
    clear:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It appears that his complaint is really that
    the rating system has changed, not with the rating itself. Specifically, the allegation
    is that the ‘D-’ was libelous when compared with an ‘unsatisfactory’ rating.
    The court finds, however, that in considering both the words in and of
    themselves, and in their greater context, it is not satisfied on the balance of
    probabilities that defamation has been made out. Indeed it is uncertain whether
    ‘D-’ was a diminution or an improvement over ‘unsatisfactory’.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The context in which words are used is relevant
    to determining meaning. So too are any reasonable implications the words may
    bear, the audience to whom they were published, and the manner in which they
    were presented<i>: <em>Botiuk v. Toronto Free Press Publications Ltd.</em></i>,
    [1995] 3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 62. But it need not be established that an impugned
    statement is worse than prior statements made by a defendant in order for that
    statement to be defamatory. Although context may be important in determining
    whether a statement is defamatory, the plain and ordinary meaning must also be
    considered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given the trial judge’s error, it fell to the
    Divisional Court to determine whether the D- grade was defamatory. In my view,
    it was open to the Divisional Court on the record that was before it to
    conclude that it was defamatory. As the court explained, at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In summary, the rating means, in its plain and
    ordinary meaning, in the context in which it was written, that BBB has
    conducted a fair and impartial assessment of [Walsh] and concluded, on the
    limited information available to BBB, that [Walsh] is not trustworthy, ethical
    or responsive to customer complaints.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept the BBB’s submission
    that the Divisional Court adopted the worst possible meaning. The D- grade must
    be understood in the context of the BBB’s stated purpose. The BBB website
    states that its mission is to be “the leader in advancing marketplace trust”,
    which it accomplishes by, among other things, “[d]enouncing substandard
    marketplace behavior”. The website goes on to state that it regards trust as a
    function of integrity and performance, and defines integrity as including
    “respect, ethics and intent”. Performance is described as relating to a “business’
    track record of delivering results in accordance with BBB standards and/or
    addressing customer concerns in a timely, satisfactory manner”. In light of
    this, it was open to the court to find that the plain and ordinary meaning of
    the D- grade the BBB assigned Walsh was defamatory.</span></p>

    420, at para. 28 and recapitulated in <em>Grant </em>at para. 31. A defendant

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    comment defence, stating the test and concluding it was met. The Divisional
    Court held that the trial judge erred by conflating fair comment with the
    defence of qualified privilege, and in applying the fair comment defence
    without first construing the plain and ordinary meaning of the impugned words. Despite
    its criticism of the trial judge's decision, the Divisional Court acknowledged
    that the trial judge found that the BBB's ratings concerned a &quot;matter of
    public interest&quot; – the integrity and customer service record of small
    businesses – and agreed with his finding. &nbsp;The court acknowledged,
    further, that that the D- grade was a comment, easily recognizable as an
    opinion as opposed to statement of fact, and was based on facts.<b> </b>These conclusions
    aligned with those of the trial judge and satisfied the first three prongs of
    the test from <em>WIC Radio</em>. However, the court remitted the matter for a
    new trial rather than itself determining whether the test was met on the facts,
    because it found the trial judge failed to analyze the “objective honest belief”
    branch of the test.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The BBB submits that the Divisional Court made
    findings that were contradicted by the evidence and erred in its application of
    the fair comment test. In particular, the court erred in failing to
    characterize the BBB’s opinion as based on its criteria and the facts in the
    BBB file, and in requiring the impugned statement to satisfy a test of
    objective reasonableness. The BBB submits that the only facts necessary to
    apply the fair comment test were the BBB website and Walsh’s admission that it
    had refused to respond to a customer complaint. It was not necessary to remit
    the matter for a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its cross-appeal, Walsh submits that the
    Divisional Court erred in its application of the second branch of the fair
    comment test. In particular, Walsh submits that the BBB did not disclose
    Walsh’s D- grade was the result of a failure to respond to a single complaint,
    and that Walsh had informed the BBB that it would not respond to BBB complaints
    but would deal directly with any customers that contacted it with a complaint.
    In the absence of this information, Walsh says that it was impossible for
    readers to assess the merits of the D- grade it was assigned.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it was open to the Divisional Court
    to determine whether the fair comment defence was satisfied on the record before
    it, and the court ought to have done so rather than remit the matter for new
    trial. I address the parties’ submissions below.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><em>Was the opinion based on fact?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second branch of the fair comment test requires
    that the facts underlying an impugned opinion be “sufficiently stated or
    otherwise be known to the listeners” to allow the listeners to make up their
    own minds about the opinion: <i>WIC Radio</i>, at para. 31. The defence of fair
    comment is not available if the factual foundation for an opinion is either unstated
    or unknown, or turns out to be false. That said, if there is a factual
    foundation for an opinion, there is no requirement that the opinion be
    reasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I see no need to remit the fair comment defence
    for new trial to determine if there was a factual basis for the BBB’s opinion. The
    issue is not so complex that it requires a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the factual basis for the BBB’s
    opinion was clearly set out in the record. As the Divisional Court noted, under
    the BBB’s rating system, “[a] single refusal to address a customer complaint
    through BBB mediation would result in a grade of A being reduced to D-.” Here,
    Walsh admitted that it had not responded to the individual complaint. Moreover,
    it is undisputed that the BBB website identified the points applicable to
    specific criteria, how scores were converted into letter grades, and
    definitions of the weighted factors. Nothing further was required.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><em>Could any person honestly express that opinion on the
    proved facts?</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge set out the test from <em>WIC
    Radio</em> and stated that it was satisfied, the Divisional Court held that the
    trial judge erred in failing to deal with this branch of the test – the objective
    test, which turns on whether any person could honestly express the BBB’s opinion
    on the proved facts. Again, however, it was open to the Divisional Court to
    deal with the matter on the basis of the record that was before the court.
    Remitting the matter for a new trial was unnecessary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following <em>WIC Radio</em>, an objective test
    replaced the subjective test for this branch of the fair comment analysis. What
    matters at this stage is whether a person could honestly express the opinion,
    given the proved facts – not whether the BBB actually held the opinion. The
    court does not evaluate the objective reasonableness of an opinion in light of
    the facts. It is enough that the opinion could honestly be held and has “a
    basis” in the facts. A court does not consider whether the facts “warranted”
    the comment or whether the comment “fairly” arose out of the facts: <em>WIC
    Radio</em><i>, </i>at para. 39. As Binnie J. acknowledged in <em>WIC Radio</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 50, “the ‘objective’ test is
    not a high threshold for the defendants to meet, but nor is it in the public
    interest to deny the defence to a piece of devil’s advocacy that the writer may
    have doubts about (but is quite capable of honest belief) which contributes to
    the debate on a matter of public interest.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The drop to a D- grade simply on the basis of
    one unanswered complaint may be thought harsh, but it is inherent in the fair
    comment defence that, provided the BBB’s opinion is based on facts and could
    honestly be held, it is protected whether it is harsh or gentle, reasonable or
    unreasonable. As Binnie J. explained in <em>WIC Radio</em>,<i> </i>a trier of fact
    “is not required to assess whether the comment is a reasonable and proportional
    response to the stated or understood facts”: see para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the D- grade was an opinion that
    could honestly have been expressed on the proved facts. Put another way, it cannot
    be said that no one<i> </i>could honestly hold that opinion. This is sufficient
    to satisfy, in the general terms required, the fourth branch of the fair
    comment test. Accordingly, there was no reason to remit the matter for new
    trial. The fair comment defence was established.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span lang=EN-US>(3)     Was fair comment defeated

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence of fair comment, like qualified
    privilege, is defeated if the plaintiff establishes the impugned comment was
    made with malice. Malice includes spite or ill-will, but may also be
    established by showing that a comment was made with an indirect motive or
    ulterior purpose, dishonestly, or in knowing or reckless disregard for the
    truth. See <em>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R.
    1130, at para. 145. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that Walsh failed to meet
    its burden. The BBB website made clear that there was only one unanswered complaint
    against Walsh; there was no plan or hidden agenda to force Wash into the BBB’s
    conciliation process or BBB membership; and there was no evidence that the BBB
    dealt with Walsh differently than any other companies. In sum, the trial judge
    concluded that the there was “simply no evidence” of malice in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The BBB submits that the Divisional Court ought
    to have deferred to these findings. There was no basis for the Divisional Court
    to remit the question of malice for new trial. I agree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Walsh submits that it must be inferred that the
    D- grade was assigned for the dominant purpose of preferring the interests of
    BBB members and encouraging non-members to become paying members of the BBB. It
    notes that the A+ grade is only available to BBB members. A BBB member with an
    A+ grade would be less affected if it failed to respond to a customer complaint
    than a non-member, who would be starting from a maximum grade of A.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I see no palpable and overriding error in the
    trial judge’s analysis. The trial judge stated the applicable test, considered
    the arguments that made by the parties, and concluded that Walsh had failed to
    meet the difficult burden of establishing malice. The trial judge was not
    required to draw the inference Walsh submits. The trial judge reached a
    conclusion that was open to him on the record, and the Divisional Court erred
    in concluding otherwise.</span></p>

    Bakery Ltd.</em>, 2004 SCC 9, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303, at para. 27. As this court
    held in <em>Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario</em> (2004) 71 O.R. (3d) 291 at para. 37, the overriding principle in assessing
    costs is the reasonableness of the costs award: “[t]he failure to refer, in
    assessing costs, to the overriding principle of reasonableness, can produce a
    result that is contrary to the fundamental objective of access to
    justice.&quot; The assessment of costs is not purely mathematical exercise, but

    of Civil Procedure</em><i>,</i> he considered them under r. 57. But the trial
    judge failed to consider the fairness and reasonableness of the costs awarded, and
    did not provide an adequate justification for the striking disparity in the
