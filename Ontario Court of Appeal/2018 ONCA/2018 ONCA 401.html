    J. that awarded the applicant, Union Building Corporation of Canada, the sum of
    $407,582, together with interest and costs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and dismiss the
    application.</p>
  <h1>Background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By an Agreement of Purchase and Sale made in July 2015 (the “APS”), the
    appellant agreed to sell to the respondent an undeveloped 3.6 acre parcel of
    land for a sale price of $3,960,000. The land was zoned agricultural and was
    part of a larger 19.29 acre parcel of land owned by the appellant in the City
    of Markham (the “City”). The respondent wished to purchase the land so that it
    could develop it for its head office.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The APS contained a provision, clause 17, making the sale conditional
    upon the City consenting to a severance of the land being sold to the
    respondent from the larger parcel owned by the appellant, pursuant to s. 50 of
    the <em>Planning Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13. Clause 17 provided that the
    appellant would seek the severance and satisfy any conditions the City imposed,
    except for conditions that were “onerous or unreasonable”. In the event the
    City imposed an onerous or unreasonable condition, clause 17 provided that the
    appellant could give the respondent the opportunity to satisfy such severance
    condition. If the respondent chose not to do so, then the APS would be null and
    void. The full text of clause 17 appears in the appendix to these reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The severance was obtained by the appellant but it was made subject to
    certain conditions. One of the severance conditions that the City imposed was
    to require the appellant to enter into the Cathedral West Cost Sharing
    Agreement (the “Cost Sharing Agreement”) – a private agreement among other
    landowners in the area who were developing, or had developed, their lands. The
    appellant had no intention of developing its property and had not previously
    entered into the Cost Sharing Agreement. One aspect of entering into the Cost
    Sharing Agreement was that the appellant would have to fund development related
    costs in the amount of $407,582.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant took the position that this severance condition was
    onerous or unreasonable under clause 17. It was not developing the land. It was
    selling the land. The evidence showed that there was no precedent in the City
    for a non-developing vendor being forced, as a condition of severance, to enter
    into a cost sharing agreement among developers – something the City’s Official
    Plan required only of “development proponents”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant invoked its rights under clause 17 and gave the respondent
    the option to satisfy the severance condition. The respondent disagreed that
    the severance condition was onerous or unreasonable. It took the position that clause
    17 required the appellant to satisfy the condition. However, in order to
    prevent the APS from floundering on this issue, the respondent agreed to pay
    the $407,582 necessary to satisfy the severance condition but reserved its rights
    to seek that amount back from the appellant. On that basis, the purchase of the
    property closed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent then brought the underlying application to the Superior
    Court of Justice for a determination that the appellant was required to pay the
    $407,582 that the respondent had paid to satisfy the severance condition. As
    the Notice of Application makes clear, the issue fell to be determined on the
    meaning of the words in clause 17. Indeed, in the Notice of Application, the
    respondent sought the following relief:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>a declaration that Woodmills is solely responsible for the
    associated costs of satisfying section 17 of the Purchase Agreement, and more
    specifically Unifor’s $407,582 without prejudice payment/contribution to the
    City of Markham...</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The hearing before the application judge proceeded on this basis. As the
    Notice of Application also states, the parties had agreed “that the Court
    should determine the single issue regarding the $407,582 payment”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching his conclusion, however, the application judge took a different route.
    He decided the application based upon his interpretation of clause 19 of the
    APS, a provision that dealt with the requirement to get an amendment to the
    existing agricultural zoning for the property being conveyed. Indeed, the application
    judge said in his reasons, at para. 26:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The issue in this case is not determined by an understanding of
    the application of clause 17 of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale. Rather it
    is the requirement found in clause 19 that the zoning for the intended
    development of the purchaser be in place and be “in full force and effect” (see
    para. [20] above) at the time the property was sold.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge observed that clause 19 of the APS required the amended
    zoning to be in full force and effect at the time of closing. However, the
    amended zoning, as passed by the City, had a “hold” in place. The “hold” would
    be lifted once there was compliance with the Cost Sharing Agreement and payment
    of the accompanying obligations. The application judge concluded that the
    amended zoning was not “in full force and effect” until that payment was made.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Consequently, he found that the appellant was required to bear the costs
    associated with the Cost Sharing Agreement. He therefore granted the
    application and ordered the appellant to pay the $407,582 to the respondent.</p>
  <h1>Analysis</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a normal situation, an application judge’s interpretation of a non-standard
    form contract is entitled to deference. This is because the interpretation of such
    a contract involves a question of mixed fact and law: <em>Sattva Capital Corp.
    v. Creston Moly Corp</em><i>.</i>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, at para.
    50. As such, on an appeal from a judicial decision, the interpretation of a
    non-standard form contract is normally reviewable only for palpable and
    overriding error unless there is an extricable question of law: <em>Housen v.
    Nikolaisen</em>, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 36.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are, however, situations where a broader principle involving natural justice overtakes
    questions of contractual interpretation. One of the instances where that broader
    principle is invoked is where a judge decides a proceeding on a basis that was not
    “anchored in the pleadings, evidence, positions or submissions of any of the
    parties”:<i> <em>Labatt Brewing Co. v. NHL Enterprises Canada L.P.</em></i>, 2011
    ONCA 511, 106 O.R. (3d) 677, at para. 5. When that occurs, the judge commits an
    error of law: <em>Moore v. Sweet</em>, 2017 ONCA 182, 134 O.R. (3d) 721, at
    para. 30 (leave to appeal to S.C.C. allowed [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 156 with
    judgment reserved on February 8, 2018). That error results from the procedural
    unfairness that is visited upon the parties which, by itself, warrants
    appellate intervention: <em>Rodaro v. Royal Bank of Canada</em> (2002), 59 O.R.
    (3d) 74 (C.A.), at para. 62.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the parties proceeded before the application judge for a
    determination of their respective rights based on the interpretation of clause
    17 of the APS. More specifically, the parties sought a determination as to whether
    the payment required under the Cost Sharing Agreement, as a condition of the
    severance, was onerous or unreasonable under Clause 17. Clause 19 was not part
    of the dispute between the parties. In fact, the respondent never took the
    position that there was any failure by the appellant to comply with its
    obligations in respect of the property’s zoning or the requirements of clause 19.
    There is also not a single mention of clause 19 in the Notice of Application nor
    is there any mention of the zoning issue generally. Further, this court was told
    that there was no mention of clause 19 during the course of the application hearing,
    save for a passing reference in the respondent’s reply. While counsel for the
    respondent hedged on this issue at the appeal hearing, any doubt on this point
    is removed by the contents of the application judge’s reasons on costs. In
    those reasons, he said, at paras. 5-6:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Time was spent examining the requirement of severance, and how
    it should be applied in the particular context. As it is, the decision made
    reflects not on that question but on zoning and the responsibility to have the
    rezoning of the property “in full force and effect” at the time of sale.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>This understanding did not arise from the submissions made
    but from the separate consideration by the court</u>. My concern for the award
    of costs does not stem from the failure of the applicant to establish bad faith
    or the unnecessary reliance of the respondent on what members of the municipal
    staff or others might have anticipated independent of the words of the
    agreement but on the fact that <u>for all the effort made the answer lay in a
    place the parties, for whatever reason, did not identify</u>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the authorities make clear, the application judge’s decision to dispose of the
    application on a basis that was not advanced by the parties amounts to a denial
    of procedural fairness. That reality mandates that the decision must be set
    aside. The issue then becomes whether the matter must be remitted back to the
    Superior Court of Justice for a fresh determination, or whether the issue can
    be determined by this court on the basis of the existing record and the
    arguments that were made by the parties on the interpretation of clause 17.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the record and arguments allow this court to make its own determination
    pursuant to s. 134(1)(a) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C.43.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause
    17 permits the appellant to refuse to comply with a condition of severance that
    is onerous or unreasonable. The application judge made brief reference at the
    tail end of his reasons to the fact that, while the $407,582 that had to be paid
    under the Cost Sharing Agreement was approximately 10.3% of the $3,960,000 sale
    price, there was no evidence as to the percentage that the $407,582 represented
    in terms of the profit the appellant would make on the sale of the property.
    This led the application judge to say, at para. 32, “in the absence of context
    it is not possible to assess whether $407,582 is ‘onerous’.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, that is not the appropriate test to be applied in determining whether
    the amount to be paid under the Cost Sharing Agreement was onerous or
    unreasonable under clause 17. In fact, it is not the onerous exception that
    applies to the payment, it is the unreasonable exception. What renders the
    payment unreasonable, in these circumstances, is the fact that the appellant
    never had any intention of developing this property. It was selling the
    property. It was the respondent that wished to develop the property. I share
    the position of the appellant that it would be unreasonable for it to have to
    pay what is undeniably a cost of development from the price that it negotiated
    for the sale of an undeveloped property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, reasonableness must be interpreted objectively. There was ample
    objective evidence demonstrating that a reasonable person would not consider
    the requirement, that a vendor of undeveloped land pay the costs associated
    with the future development of the land, to be a reasonable interpretation of
    the APS. As noted earlier, there was no precedent in the City for a
    non-developing vendor being forced, as a condition of severance, to enter into
    a cost sharing agreement among developers. This conclusion is reinforced by the
    application judge’s finding, at para. 30 of his reasons, that the appellant was
    “surprised” to find that it would be required to enter into the Cost Sharing
    Agreement, which related entirely to developers, in order to sever the property
    so that it could sell it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the condition imposed by the City, that the Cost Sharing
    Agreement be entered into, with the requisite $407,582 payment in order to
    obtain the severance, was an unreasonable one for the appellant to bear. It
    therefore fell to the respondent, under clause 17, to either bear that cost or
    terminate the APS. The respondent chose the former.</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below, and dismiss the
    application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber>17.     <u>Severance</u></span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span class=MsoPageNumber>This Agreement is subject to
    the express condition that this Agreement is effective only if the provisions
    of Section 50 of the <i>Planning Act</i> (Ontario), as amended from time to
    time, have been complied with. Forthwith following the date the size and
    configuration of the Property has been determined, the Vendor, at the Vendor’s
    sole expense, shall make application for the consent of the Committee of
    Adjustment for the City of Markham in order to permit the conveyance of the
    Property to the Purchaser in accordance with the subdivision control provisions
    of the <i>Planning Act</i> and shall proceed diligently using all reasonable
    efforts to successfully complete this application.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span class=MsoPageNumber>All conditions imposed in
    the severance consent shall have been complied with on or before the Closing
    Date. The Vendor shall satisfy all conditions imposed in connection with the
    severance consent at its sole expense provided that such conditions are not
    onerous or unreasonable. In the event that the conditions of consent are
    onerous or unreasonable and as a result the Vendor is not prepared to satisfy
    the conditions imposed in the severance consent, the Purchaser at the Vendor’s
    sole and unfettered discretion shall have the option of satisfying the
    conditions imposed in the severance consent at the cost of the Purchaser. If by
    October 30, 2016 (the “Severance Date”) the necessary consent is not given, or
    if approval is given but conditions are attached which the Vendor is not
    prepared to satisfy for the reasons stated herein (and the Purchaser does not
    elect to satisfy, upon having been given the option to do so) or if approval is
    given but is appealed and the Vendor is not prepared to defend such appeal,
    this Agreement shall be null and void, the Deposit and any accrued interest
    thereon shall be returned to the Purchaser and neither party shall have any
    future obligations to the other respecting this Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Vendor shall prepare the
    reference plan(s) required in order to effect the severance consent at its sole
    cost and expense, which reference plan shall be subject to the Purchaser’s
    written approval, acting reasonably.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span class=MsoPageNumber>Prior to submitting any
    materials to the Committee of Adjustment for the City of Markham in respect of
    the severance consent, the Vendor shall first deliver same to the Purchaser for
    the Purchaser’s written approval, such approval not to be unreasonably delayed
    or withheld. The Vendor shall keep the Purchaser informed of all matters in
    connection with the severance process and shall provide the Purchaser with
    copies of all materials in respect thereof.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=MsoPageNumber>19.     <u>Zoning</u></span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Purchaser acknowledges
    that the Property is currently zoned “Agricultural” and is designated as
    Business Park Corridor by the Official Plan of Markham. The Purchaser intends
    to construct a three storey office building of approximately 65,000 square feet
    with approximately 300 surface parking stalls (“Purchaser's Intended
    Development”). This Agreement shall be conditional until August 1, 2016 upon
    the Vendor obtaining Zoning in the Final Form required for the Purchaser's
    Intended Development of the Property. For the purposes of this Agreement,
    Zoning in Final Form shall mean an Official Plan amendment and/or rezoning of
    the Property re-designating and rezoning the Property to permit the Purchaser's
    Intended Development and such redesignation and rezoning being in full force
    and effect, with all appeal periods having expired without appeals, or all
    appeals having been determined to the satisfaction of the Purchaser without any
    further right of appeal. The required zoning change is to be undertaken at the
    sole cost and responsibility of the Vendor. Such rezoning may be completed
    prior to the Closing Date, but in the event that such rezoning is not
    completed, the Vendor or at its sole discretion may extend the Closing Date to
    such a time when the rezoning has been completed and is in force and effect. In
    such case, the Vendor shall notify the Purchaser in writing of the successor
    rezoning, and the Closing Date shall be amended to reflect thirty (30) days
    from such event. In the event that that Vendor is unable to obtain the
    necessary rezoning by December 1, 2016 then this agreement shall become null
    and void and the Vendor shall return all Deposits to the Purchaser with
    interest and without penalty.</span></p>
