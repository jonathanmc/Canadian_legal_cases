  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Hugh R. McLean of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated November 7, 2016, with reasons reported at
    2016 ONSC 5041.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Watt J.A.:</strong></p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capcorp Planning (2003) Inc. (“Capcorp”) sold a health and welfare plan
    (“HWP”). Some employers found the HWP attractive, especially owner/manager
    operations where the owner or manager of the corporation was the only employee seeking
    coverage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under Capcorp’s HWP, a participating employer agreed to pay specified
    expenses incurred by participating employees. When an employee incurred an
    expense said to be covered by the HWP, the employer submitted a claim and a cheque
    to Capcorp for the expense claimed and an administrative fee for Capcorp. After
    a review of the claim, Capcorp determined whether the expense claimed was
    covered by the HWP. If the claim was covered, Capcorp reimbursed the employee
    for the expense.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capcorp did not charge retail sales tax (“RST”) on any amounts employers
    paid and it received in respect of claims made under the HWP. The Minister of
    Revenue (“the Minister”) considered that RST was exigible for these amounts,
    assessed Capcorp accordingly and required Capcorp to pay a penalty plus
    interest for failure to collect and remit the RST the Minister considered
    applicable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issues assigned to us for determination are whether RST was exigible
    on the amounts paid by employers under the HWP and, if so, whether Capcorp is
    liabile to a penalty for having failed to collect and remit the RST. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I will explain, I agree with the appellant Minister that Capcorp was
    required to charge, collect and remit RST and is subject to penalty for having
    failed to do so.</p>
  <h1>The background facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The underlying circumstances are largely uncontroversial and require
    only brief elaboration beyond what has already been said. </p>
  <h2>The Plan and Its Participants</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capcorp provides insurance solutions to business owners. A typical
    client is the owner/manager of a small or medium-sized business with insurance
    needs. Capcorp determines the client’s needs for life, disability, critical
    illness and health insurance and then offers a range of individual and group
    plans including third party insurance products and the HWP.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Individual and group plans from insurance companies supplement
    provincial health coverage by covering services or items not covered by OHIP,
    including dental and vision care and some prescription drugs. But these plans
    often require medical prerequisites and limit the scope of coverage for
    dependants, and may offer little beyond coverage provided by provincial health
    care. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The HWP, by contrast, contained less demanding medical prerequisites and
    offered more generous coverage for the dependants of plan members. Accordingly,
    it found favour with individuals who had been rejected from extended health care
    coverage under independent private plans.</p>
  <h2>Participation in the HWP</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    participate in the HWP, an employer agreed to pay specified expenses incurred
    by a participating employee and an administrative fee to Capcorp. Since most
    involved in the HWP were individuals, the HWP functioned as an alternative to
    an individual health insurance plan for an employee.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    enrol in the HWP, an employer completed a Notice of Participation which
    identified the participating employee, any dependants, the type of benefits
    covered and the extent of the coverage. The relationship between Capcorp and a participating
    employer was governed by the Notice of Participation and the HWP Master Plan. Capcorp
    constantly reviewed the insurance marketplace to make better options available
    to its clients.</p>
  <h2>The Claims Reimbursement Procedure</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    an employee asserted a claim for a covered expense under the HWP, the employer
    submitted the claim, together with a cheque for the amount of the claim and the
    administrative fee to which Capcorp was entitled. Capcorp reviewed the claim to
    determine whether it fell within the coverage provided. Where the claim related
    to a covered expense, Capcorp sent a cheque to the employee for the amount of
    the claimed expense. </p>
  <h2>The Audit and Assessment</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    auditor from the Ministry of Revenue reviewed the records of Capcorp and found
    that the company had not charged, collected or remitted RST on any amounts paid
    by employers to Capcorp for claims under the HWP from August 1, 2005 until
    March 31, 2009. Capcorp was assessed a penalty of $278,625.31, including
    interest. The assessment was based on the auditor’s determination that the HWP
    was a “benefits plan” subject to taxation under the<em> Retail Sales Tax Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. R. 31, as amended. Capcorp, by extension, was required to
    charge, collect and remit RST. Failure to do so rendered the company liable to
    the penalty assessed. </p>
  <h2>The Objection</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capcorp
    objected. The Minister affirmed the assessment and penalty.</p>
  <h2>The Appeal</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the Minister confirmed the assessment, Capcorp appealed to the Superior Court
    of Justice under s. 25 of the <i>RSTA</i>. Capcorp contended that:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>payments made by employers under the HWP were exempt from RST; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Notice of Assessment did not properly explain the basis for the
    penalty imposed on Capcorp; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Capcorp had exercised due diligence in determining its obligations to
    collect RST.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    brief summary of the relevant provisions of the <i>RSTA</i> will help
    illuminate the appeal judge’s analysis. Further detail is provided later in
    these reasons, where necessary. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2.1(1) of the <i>RSTA</i>, in relevant part,<i> </i>requires that “[e]very
    person who is resident in Ontario, or who carries on business and Ontario and
    who:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(a) enters
    into a contract of insurance with an insurer;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(b) is a
    person whose risk is covered by group insurance; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>(c) is a <u>planholder
    or member of a benefits plan;</u> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>shall pay … a tax at the rate of 8 percent of the
    premium payable” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    “benefits plan” is defined under s. 1(1) of the <i>RSTA</i> as a funded
    benefits plan, an unfunded benefits plan or a qualifying trust. The term
    “unfunded benefits plan” is exhaustively defined in s. 1(1) to mean: </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:
normal'>a plan which gives <u>protection against risk to an individual that
    could otherwise be obtained by taking out a contract of insurance</u>, whether
    the benefits are partly insured or not, and where payments are made by the
    planholder directly to or on behalf of the member of the plan or to the vendor
    upon the occurrence of the risk. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge concluded that the HWP was not a policy of insurance, group
    insurance, or a funded benefits plan. In his view, the HWP was most akin to an
    “unfunded benefits plan” for the purposes of the <em>RSTA</em>. The judge then
    focused on the language “a risk to an individual that could otherwise be
    obtained by taking out a contract of insurance” in the exhaustive definition of
    “unfunded benefits plan”. He accepted the evidence adduced by Capcorp that most
    of the employers who enrolled in the HWP could not obtain health insurance that
    would supplement their OHIP coverage. In the absence of evidence from the
    Minister to contradict the testimony about the HWP constituency, the appeal
    judge concluded that since those who enrolled in the HWP would not be able to
    obtain insurance coverage, they were not required to pay RST on the amount they
    paid to Capcorp. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essentials of the appeal judge’s analysis appear in three paragraphs
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It, therefore, seems to this Court that those persons who would
    not be able to obtain coverage by insurance would not be required to pay retail
    sales tax on the amount they paid to the Appellant.  As stated in their factum
    at para. 66, the Respondent takes the position that:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>In order for Capcorp to “demolish” the assumptions upon
    which an assessment is made, it must make out at least a <em>prima facie</em> case. Only then, will the onus of proving the assumptions be shifted to the
    Minister, and the onus will not be “lightly or capriciously or casually
    shifted.” </p>
  <p class=CQuote>As set out in the decision of <em>Orly Automobiles Inc. v.
    Canada</em>, 2005 FCA 425, 345 N.R. 284, the onus to establish a <em>prima
    facie</em> case “will not be lightly or capriciously or casually shifted.” <u>However,
    here, a <em>prima facie</em> case has been made out with regard to whether
    health insurance for this risk was otherwise available in regard to this Plan
    which is an unfunded benefits plan. Here the evidence is uncontradicted and
    indicates that insurance for this type of risk would not be available. There is
    no contradictory evidence. Therefore, it seems that a <em>prima facie</em> case
    has been made out.</u> Thus, it is the Court’s view that the onus has shifted
    to the Respondent Crown and that burden has not been met by the Respondent. At
    the very least, the Respondent should have provided some evidence statistically
    or otherwise indicating what portion of these persons would not be covered.
    This is particularly key in the face of the evidence that was called. It is
    impossible for the Court on the basis of the record to distinguish those who
    were using this Plan for convenience only and those who actually required the
    Plan in the sense that they could not obtain health coverage otherwise. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>That being the case, with no evidence to the contrary being
    called by the Respondent, the Court is of the view that the assessment in total
    has not been justified on the basis of the evidence presented. Therefore, for
    those reasons the assessment is quashed. [Emphasis Added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge considered and rejected two further grounds of appeal advanced by Capcorp.
    He held that the nature of the penalty imposed – the amount of tax that should
    have been collected – was implicit in the <em>RSTA</em>. He also decided that
    the defence of due diligence had no application to the Minister’s assessment. </p>
  <h1>The grounds of appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Minister advances two grounds of appeal, the second, an alternative to the
    first. The Minister submits that the appeal judge erred:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in his interpretation of the definition of an “unfunded benefits plan”
    under the <em>RSTA</em>; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in the alternative, in his consideration of the evidence, by prematurely
    shifting the burden of proof to the Minister, in failing to consider relevant
    evidence and in misapprehending the nature and sufficiency of Capcorp’s
    evidence. </p>
  <h2>Ground # 1: The Interpretation of “unfunded benefits plan”</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    earlier paragraphs I have canvassed relevant features of the HWP including
    enrolment and administration and attempted to set out the essence of the appeal
    judge’s reasoning that underpinned his interpretation of the term “unfunded
    benefits plan” in s. 1(1) of the <em>RSTA</em>. No useful purpose will be
    achieved by their repetition here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Preliminary
    to a summary of the arguments advanced on this issue of statutory
    interpretation, it is helpful to set down a more extensive outline of some of
    the statutory definitions that have a say in our interpretation. </p>
  <h2>The Definitions</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    convenience, I will repeat the definition of the term “unfunded benefits plan”
    in s. 1(1) of the <em>RSTA</em>:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>a plan which gives protection against risk to an
    individual that could otherwise be obtained by taking out a contract of
    insurance, whether the benefits are partly insured or not, and where payments
    are made by the planholder directly to or on behalf of the member of the plan

    the component parts of this definition, the terms “protection against risk to

  <h2><span lang=EN>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The Minister begins his submissions with a reminder about the
    applicable standards of review: correctness for the appeal judge’s
    interpretation of the term “unfunded benefits plan”, and palpable and
    overriding error for the assessment of the evidence adduced and findings of
    fact, except for extricable errors of law or principle. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The Minister says that the appeal judge erred in his interpretation of
    the term “unfunded benefits plan”. An unfunded benefits plan is simply an
    alternative to a contract of insurance for the purpose of obtaining protection
    against specified risks to an individual. Provided the protections extended by
    the plan could be obtained under an insurance contract, it is immaterial that a
    particular individual under the plan cannot get alternative insurance coverage,
    whether because of a pre-existing condition or otherwise. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The Minister submits that the appeal judge’s interpretation of the term
    “unfunded benefits plan” is flawed for several reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>First, the appeal judge’s interpretation undermines the consistency,
    predictability and workability of the </span><em>RSTA</em><span lang=EN>. Tax
    statutes must be interpreted to achieve consistency, predictability and
    fairness. Interpretations that interfere with efficient administration and
    enforcement or result in pointless hardship and inconvenience must be rejected.
    Interpretations that bring about a more workable and practical result are
    preferable, providing the words of the enactment can reasonably bear that
    interpretation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>According to the Minister, the appeal judge’s interpretation would
    result in parties’ obligations under the Act changing, depending on the state
    of the insurance marketplace at a particular time. In a similar way, the
    judge’s interpretation would create significant enforcement difficulties. To
    determine whether tax was exigible on a plan, the Minister would have to determine
    the historical state of the insurance market for the entire period of the audit
    and assess medical information about each member of the plan for the same
    period. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Second, the Minister continues, the appeal judge’s interpretation
    creates irrational and arbitrary distinctions between those who use an unfunded
    benefits plan for convenience, on the one hand, and those who do so out of
    necessity, on the other. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Third, the Minister submits the appeal judge’s interpretation is at
    odds with the statutory definition of an “unfunded benefits plan”. The
    definition is ostensive, that is to say, it relies on the concept of a contract
    of insurance to explain the concept of an unfunded benefits plan. Such a plan
    is an alternative to a contract of insurance. The HWP is not excluded from the
    definition simply because it can provide a level of coverage to some
    individuals above and beyond what they could have obtained through a contract
    of insurance. After all, the legislature used the term “could”, not “can”,
    which suggests the definition focuses on the hypothetical not the actual
    availability of insurance to planholders. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN> Fourth, according to the Minister, the broad definition of “protection
    against risk to an individual” supports this interpretation. The definition suggests
    that an unfunded benefits plan provides a wide basket of benefits otherwise
    available under a contract of insurance. But it does not exclude plans that
    provide additional coverage for a particular expense or a greater percentage of
    reimbursement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Finally, the Minister says, the legislative history demonstrates that
    where an employer “self-insures” the cost of its employee benefits, as in the
    HWP, RST is exigible. The legislative history also confirms that unfunded
    benefits plans are provided in lieu of contracts of insurance and should
    therefore receive similar tax treatment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Capcorp says that the appeal judge correctly interpreted the term
    “unfunded benefits plan” by assigning to it a meaning supported by the plain language
    of the phrase. In addition, the judge properly found on the uncontradicted evidence
    adduced that protection against risk to individuals covered by the HWP could
    not otherwise be obtained by taking out a contract of insurance. This was so
    because there were material differences in the benefits offered under the HWP
    and those available under contracts of insurance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Capcorp also relies on general principles of statutory interpretation
    to support its position. The argument it advances is grounded in a textual,
    contextual and purposive analysis of the plain meaning of the statutory definition,
    harmonious with the legislation as a whole. The actual words of the taxation
    statute are critical to determine its meaning. Where ambiguity arises, courts
    must adopt the construction that favours the taxpayer.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In the end, Capcorp says, the appeal judge properly interpreted the
    applicable provisions of the</span><em> RSTA</em><span lang=EN>. He relied on
    the precise language in the definition of “unfunded benefits plan” and rightly
    rejected the Minister’s reliance on policy considerations to displace the plain
    meaning of the unambiguous language chosen by the legislator. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>The Governing Principles</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN> Determination of this ground of appeal requires us to interpret the
    term “unfunded benefits plan” as exhaustively defined in s. 1(1) of the </span><em>RSTA</em><span
lang=EN>. This requires a consideration not only of the general principles
    informing statutory interpretation, but also those specific to the
    interpretation of taxation statutes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>  It has been long established that there is but one principle or
    approach to statutory interpretation and that is that the words of the statute
    are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the
    intention of the enacting legislative body: </span><em>Agraira v. Canada
    (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</em><span lang=EN>, 2013
    SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 64; </span><em>Canada Trustco Mortgage
    Co. v. R.</em><span lang=EN>, 2005 SCC 54, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 601, at para. 10. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>When we consider the written words of a statute, context inevitably
    plays an important role. Context involves the presumption of consistent
    expression, that is to say, that when different terms are used in a single
    piece of legislation, they must be understood to have different meanings. When
    the same terms are used, the same meaning should be assigned:  </span><em>Agraira,</em> <span lang=EN>at paras. 80-81.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In the interpretation of tax statutes, understandably we are required
    to place an emphasis on textual interpretation. And this is so because of the
    particularity and detail of many tax provisions. Where the legislature has
    specified the precise conditions that must be satisfied to achieve a particular
    result, it is reasonable to assume that taxpayers would rely on those
    provisions to achieve the result they prescribe: </span><em>Canada Trustco</em><span
lang=EN>, at para. 11; <i>A.Y.S.A. Amateur Youth Soccer Assn. v. Canada Revenue
    Agency</i>, 2007 SCC 42, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 217, at para. 16; <i>Aubrey Dan Family
    Trust v</i>. <i>Ontario (Finance)</i>, 2017 ONCA 875, 2017 D.T.C. 5128, at
    para. 13.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Where the words of a tax statute are precise and unequivocal, the
    ordinary meaning of the words predominates in the interpretive process.  On the
    other hand, where the words can support more than one reasonable meaning, the
    ordinary meaning of the words plays a lesser role with greater emphasis
    bestowed on the context, scheme and purpose of the Act. In such a way,
    legislative purpose may not be used to supplant clear statutory language, but
    may assist in arriving at the most plausible explanation of an indeterminate
    statutory provision: </span><em>Canada Trustco</em><span lang=EN>, at para. 10; </span><em>Placer Dome Canada Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Finance),</em><span
lang=EN> 2006 SCC 20, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 715, at para. 23; <i>Craig v. R.</i>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>It is also well established that in resolving doubt about the meaning
    of a tax provision, the administrative practice and interpretation adopted by the
    Minister are important factors to be weighed, although they are not dispositive
    of the interpretation to be accorded to the provision: </span><em>Placer Dome</em><span
lang=EN>, at para. 10. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Another principle to keep in mind where the wording of a statute may
    give rise to more than one interpretation is that where one interpretation can
    be placed on a statutory provision that would bring about a more workable and
    practical result, such an interpretation is preferable if the words the
    legislator has chosen can reasonably bear that interpretation: </span><em>Berardinelli
    v. Ontario Housing Corp., </em>[<span lang=EN>1979] 1 S.C.R. 275, at para. 19; <i>Markevich

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Two further points will round out this brief canvass of governing
    principles.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>First, the provisions of a tax statute should be interpreted in such a
    way as to achieve consistency, predictability and fairness so that taxpayers
    may manage their affairs intelligently: </span><em>Canada Trustco,</em><span
lang=EN> at paras. 11-12; </span><em>Placer Dome</em><span lang=EN>, at para.
    21.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Second, in a dispute about the proper interpretation of a tax statute, there
    is a residual presumption in favour of the taxpayer. But this residual presumption
    applies only in the exceptional case in which application of the ordinary
    principles of interpretation does not resolve the issue. Doubts about the
    meaning of a taxation statute must be reasonable. The residual presumption may
    not be enlisted unless the usual rules of statutory interpretation have been
    applied and are unavailing in an attempt to determine the meaning of the
    provision: </span><em>Placer Dome,</em><span lang=EN> at para. 24. As I will
    explain, there is no need to resort to the residual presumption because the principles
    of statutory interpretation allow us to ascertain the meaning of the statutory
    provisions in issue. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>The Principles Applied</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>For the following reasons, I would give effect to this ground of appeal
    and hold that the HWP is an “unfunded benefits plan” as the term is defined in
    s. 1(1) of the </span><em>RSTA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span
lang=EN> and thus subject to RST. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In its essence, the dispute fastens upon the meaning to be accorded to
    the clause “that could otherwise be obtained by taking out a contract of
    insurance” within the exhaustive definition of the term “unfunded benefits
    plan” in s. 1(1) of the </span><em>RSTA</em><span lang=EN>. The appeal judge
    concluded that since most employers who enrolled in the HWP would not be able
    to obtain insurance coverage, they were not required to pay RST on the amount
    they paid to Capcorp.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The parties occupy common ground on two of the essential ingredients of
    the definition of “unfunded benefits plan”:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>that the HWP is a plan; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>that the HWP is a plan “which gives protection
    against risk to an individual”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>I am persuaded that the HWP falls within the sweep of the definition of
    “unfunded benefits plan” and thus is subject to the RST assessment levied by
    the Minister. I will begin by examining the plain language of the definition,
    before assessing the broader context of the <i>Act </i>and policy
    considerations relevant to Capcorp’s proposed interpretation.  </span></p>
  <h2><em>Plain Meaning</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In my view, the plain meaning of the definition of an “unfunded
    benefits plan” in s. 1(1) is ambiguous. I agree with the Minister that the
    definition is ostensive, in that it explains the concept of an “unfunded
    benefits plan” by reference to a contract of insurance. A contract of insurance
    protects a policy holder against defined risks. Healthcare costs beyond those
    covered by a provincial healthcare plan. Prescription drug costs. Dental care.
    Vision care. Hearing care. Protection against income loss due to illness or
    accident. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>These examples illustrate the types of “protection against risk” that
    may be provided through both contracts of insurance and unfunded benefits plans.
    The question before us is whether the term “unfunded benefits plan” includes a
    plan that provides protections generally available under contracts of
    insurance, but unavailable to specific participants because of their
    pre-existing medical conditions, or some other reason. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>This question is not resolved by the plain language used to define an
    unfunded benefits plan in s. 1(1), contrary to Capcorp’s submission. If
    anything, the statutory definition supports the Minister’s proposed
    interpretation. I agree that the use of the auxiliary verb “could” in the
    phrase “could otherwise be obtained by taking out a contract of insurance”
    refers to a possibility, to potential rather than actual. What matters, it
    would appear, is the potential availability of a contract of insurance to
    protect against the risk, not congruency between the plan and contract in terms
    of enrolment requirements and extent of coverage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Moreover, the phrase “could otherwise be obtained…” can be reasonably
    read as referring to the “protection against risk” provided by a benefits plan,
    and not the specific individual to whom protection is being provided. Put
    differently, what counts is whether the protection against risk<i> </i>“could
    otherwise have been obtained through a contract of insurance”, and not whether the
    specific individual<i> </i>being insured could have obtained the coverage. It
    also bears mentioning that the expansive definition of “protection against risk
    to an individual” does not exclude from its reach a plan that provides more
    extensive coverage than a contract of insurance, either in terms of benefits
    paid or eligibility requirements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>For these reasons, the plain language within s. 1(1) does not resolve
    the interpretive issue before us. </span></p>
  <h2><em>Legislative Purpose and Efficient Administration </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The legislative purpose for taxing benefits plans supports the
    interpretation advanced by the Minister. Benefits plans became subject to RST
    following an amendment to the <i>RSTA</i>: Bill 138, <i>An Act to amend the
    Retail Sales Tax Act</i>, 3rd Sess., 35th Leg., Ontario, 1994. The explanatory
    notes accompanying Bill 138 make clear that the legislature decided to tax
    benefits plans because they were adjudged to be a substitute for insurance:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>As well, those <u>providing funded and unfunded
    benefits plans, in lieu of insurance</u>, that cover risks to an individual,
    such as death, disability, loss of income due to illness or accident, and
    payments for supplemental health care, drugs, dental and other expenses, will
    be liable to pay tax on contributions into a funded plan or on net benefits
    paid out of an unfunded plan. Those who are covered under either type of plan
    will be liable to pay tax on the contributions they made [Emphasis Added].</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Excerpts from the legislative debate on Bill 138 also suggest that
    benefits plans can be viewed as a form of self-insurance: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Bill 138 says a benefit plan is a plan that gives
    protection against risk to an individual that could otherwise be obtained
    through insurance. Such plans would typically cover payment on death or
    disability, supplement health care, drugs, dental care, vision care, hearing
    care or protection from loss of income due to illness or accident.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>What's interesting about this definition, and I
    mentioned it just a few moments ago, <u>is that where an employer self-insures
    and doesn't go out and purchase the plan but offers this benefit to their
    employee, the tax applies</u>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>What’s really interesting about this is that it
    clearly defines what happens <u>when an employer self-insures. It defines what
    a plan is, and it’s very clear that they were attempting to close any loophole
    that might give any flexibility [Emphasis Added]</u>.<a href="#_ftn1"

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Therefore, benefits plans – funded or unfunded – are taxed because the
    legislature has determined that such plans are substitutes for insurance, and should
    therefore receive similar tax treatment to contracts of insurance. Crucially, a
    plan does not cease to be a substitute for a contract of insurance simply because
    it provides protections above and beyond those that specific plan members could
    have obtained in the marketplace. To hold otherwise would arbitrarily exclude some
    benefits plans from the scope of s. 1(1), unduly restricting the provision’s
    reach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Additionally, the interpretation by the appeal judge of the term “unfunded
    benefits plan” undermines the consistency, predictability and workability of
    the provision, an essential ingredient of the interpretation of tax legislation:
    see <i>Canada Trustco</i>, at paras. 11-12; <i>Placer Dome</i>, at para. 21.
    For example, the appeal judge’s interpretation would require the Minister to
    determine the historical state of the insurance market for the entire period of
    an audit before determining whether a benefits plan should be taxable. Where an
    individual plan member’s insurability is a deciding factor, the Minister would
    have to get medical information about each member to effectively audit the
    plan. Absent clear statutory wording, I do not accept that the legislature
    intended to introduce such difficulties into the process of taxing unfunded
    benefits plans. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>For these reasons, I am satisfied that the appeal judge erred in his
    interpretation of the definition of “unfunded benefits plan” in s. 1(1) of the </span><em>RSTA</em><span

    proper interpretation, the Minister’s assessment must be restored.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>Ground # 2: The Burden of Proof Issue</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The second ground of appeal asserts that the appeal judge erred by
    prematurely shifting the onus of proof to the Minister in the absence of any
    evidence dislodging the initial obligation on Capcorp to “demolish” the
    assumptions on which the Minister relied in his assessment.</span></p>

  <h2><span lang=EN>The Evidentiary Foundation</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>On the appeal in the Superior Court of Justice, Andrew Noseworthy, the
    Chief Executive Officer of Capcorp, testified that the HWP was intended to
    replace an “individual” contract of insurance and serve as an alternative to
    such a contract for a certain constituency. He said that “individual” contracts
    of insurance do provide coverage for the costs of various services, such as
    prescription drugs, semi-private hospital accommodation, and vision, hearing
    and dental care.  However, the benefits under “individual” contracts of
    insurance are more limited and the insured is generally required to pass a
    medical examination. But where there are enough employees to enter into a
    contract for group insurance, an individual employee’s medical history will not
    necessarily prevent that employer from obtaining group coverage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Mr. Noseworthy gave evidence that the HWP could provide unlimited
    coverage for all health and dental expenses, did not require a medical
    examination and could cover any dependent who satisfies the eligible dependent
    criteria for the medical expense tax credit under the </span><em>Income Tax Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)</span></em><em>.</em> <span lang=EN>According to Mr. Noseworthy, owner-managers generally chose
    unlimited coverage under the HWP.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Mr. Noseworthy and an audit manager with the Ministry of Finance
    testified that, as a general rule, the health, dental and vision care covered
    by the HWP could be obtained by taking out a contract of insurance. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>The Reasons of the Appeal Judge</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In a passage excerpted earlier the appeal judge concluded that the
    evidence of Mr. Noseworthy on behalf of Capcorp established a</span><em> prima
    facie</em><span lang=EN> case that planholders – individual owner/managers –
    could not obtain insurance coverage for the same risks covered by the HWP.
    Since the Minister had failed to adduce any contrary evidence, the appeal judge
    quashed the Minister’s assessment. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The Minister begins with an uncontroversial submission. In tax cases,
    the burden of proof rests on the taxpayer who contests an assessment to
    demolish the assumptions on which the assessment is grounded. The standard of
    proof required is a </span><em>prima facie</em><span lang=EN> case. This means
    that the case for the taxpayer must be supported by evidence which raises such
    a degree of probability in its favour that it must be accepted, if believed,
    unless it is rebutted or the contrary is proven. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In this case, the Minister continues, the evidence adduced by Capcorp
    fell short of the </span><em>prima facie</em><span lang=EN> case standard.
    There was no evidence about the insurability of specific persons during the
    assessment period and no evidence about the state of the insurance marketplace
    during that same time. Said differently, in the absence of evidence to support
    a </span><em>prima facie</em><span lang=EN> case that HWP subscribers could not
    obtain equivalent insurance coverage, Capcorp failed in its burden. The
    assessment should stand. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Capcorp accepts not only that the initial burden of proof settles upon
    it, but also the standard of proof required to discharge that burden. But a taxpayer
    may rebut that burden in a variety of ways. And one way is by demonstrating
    that the Minister’s assumptions on which the assessment is grounded, that
    participants in the HWP could get insurance to protect against the same risks,
    is wrong.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In this case, Capcorp says, its evidence before the appeal judge
    demonstrated the incorrectness of the Minister’s assumption. Participants in
    the HWP could <i>not</i> obtain the same coverage under an insurance policy.
    Limitations were imposed. Insurability. Extent of coverage. The failure of the
    Minister to adduce contrary evidence left the Minister’s assumptions demolished
    and the assessment invalid.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>The Governing Principles</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Under s. 18(1) of the </span><em>RSTA,</em><span lang=EN> where a
    vendor has failed to make a return or a remittance as required under the Act,
    the Minister may make an assessment of the tax collected by the vendor for
    which the vendor has not accounted and the assessed amount is deemed to be the
    tax collected by the vendor. Subject to being varied or vacated on an objection
    or appeal and subject to a reassessment, the Minister’s assessment is deemed to
    be valid and binding on the taxpayer or vendor: <i>RSTA</i>, s. 18(8).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>It follows from these statutory provisions that the taxpayer bears the
    burden of establishing that the factual findings (or assumptions) on which the
    Minister grounded the assessment are wrong: </span><em>Placer Dome, </em><span
lang=EN>at para. 25. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In taxation, the standard of proof is proof on a balance of
    probabilities: </span><em>Hickman Motors Ltd. v. R.</em><span lang=EN>, [1997]
    2 S.C.R. 336</span><em>,</em><span lang=EN> at para. 92. In making assessments,
    as we have already seen, the Minister proceeds on assumptions. And so it is
    that the initial burden settled upon the taxpayer is to “demolish” the
    assumptions that underpin the assessment. To do this, the taxpayer must make
    out at least a </span><em>prima facie</em><span lang=EN> case that the Minister’s
    assumptions are wrong: </span><em>Hickman Motors,</em><span lang=EN> at paras. 92-93.
    It is only where this </span><em>prima facie</em><span lang=EN> case has been
    made out, that the burden shifts to the Minister. Where the burden shifts in
    this way and the Minister adduces no evidence whatsoever, the taxpayer succeeds
    and the assessment is vacated: </span><em>Hickman Motors</em><span lang=EN>, at
    para. 95. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN>The Principles Applied</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>I agree with the Minister and would give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>In large measure, the appeal judge’s error in finding that Capcorp’s
    evidence constituted a </span><em>prima facie</em><span lang=EN> case that
    rebutted the assumptions underlying the Minister’s assessment followed from the
    judge’s error in interpreting the term “unfunded benefits plan” under s. 1(1)
    of the Act. Capcorp’s evidence was general in nature. It revealed a lack of
    congruency or equivalency between the HWP and insurance coverage. In a
    requirement of insurability for individuals, but maybe not for groups. In the
    extent of coverage afforded. But the definition of “unfunded benefits plan” is not
    so exacting, requiring only that the protection against risk to an individual
    afforded by the plan “could otherwise be obtained by taking out a contract of
    insurance”. And “protection against risk to an individual” includes </span><em>any </em><span lang=EN>undertaking to pay, among other things, “for supplemental
    healthcare, drugs, dental care, vision care, hearing care or for protection
    against loss of income due to illness or accident…”. Capcorp’s evidence fell
    short of establishing a <i>prima facie </i>case that these types of protections
    could not “otherwise be obtained through contracts of insurance”, on the proper
    construction of the phrase.</span></p>
  <h1>OTHER GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Capcorp sought to uphold the result reached by the appeal judge –
    setting aside the Minister’s assessment – on four additional grounds. None are
    availing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>First, Capcorp argued that each Notice of Participation submitted to it
    by participating employers was a “contract of insurance … for the life, health
    or physical well-being of insured individuals”. The HWP, the argument goes, was
    therefore exempt from taxation under s. 2.1(8)(c) of the <i>RSTA</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>This submission must fail. The <i>RSTA </i>clearly distinguishes
    between benefits plans and contracts of insurance, at multiple points.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[2]</span></span></span></a> As the HWP constitutes an
    “unfunded benefits plan”, it would be incongruous if it also qualified as a
    “contract of insurance” for the purposes of the <i>RSTA</i>. Indeed, Capcorp’s
    position would render any employer benefits plan for the health and well-being
    of individual employees exempt from the <i>RSTA</i>, contrary to the clear indicia<i> </i>of legislative intent outlined above at paras. 59-60. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Second, Capcorp submitted that it is not liable to pay RST under s.
    2.1(1) of the <i>RSTA</i>, as it is not an insurer or a planholder. This
    submission does not assist Capcorp. Even if Capcorp were not required to pay
    RST under s. 2.1(1) of the </span><em>RSTA</em><span lang=EN>, it was required
    to collect and remit it as a vendor under s. 10 of the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Third, Capcorp argued, as it did before the appeal judge, that it
    exercised reasonable diligence in determining not to pay RST. I disagree. Capcorp
    was only assessed for amounts of RST it should have collected. These were
    obligations that endured despite Capcorp’s contrary interpretation of the
    requirements of the </span><em>RSTA</em><span lang=EN>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Fourth, Capcorp renewed its submission before the appeal judge that the
    Minister’s Notice of Assessment failed to set out the grounds on which a
    penalty had been imposed. Like the appeal judge, I reject this submission. I
    agree with the appeal judge that the nature of the penalty was implicit in the
    Notice of Assessment; specifically, the amount of RST that Capcorp should have
    been collecting from employers. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of
    the appeal judge and affirm the assessment of the Minister.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
