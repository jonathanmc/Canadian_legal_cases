  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Lynne Leitch of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated November 18, 2016.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Fairburn J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Judge>OVERVIEW </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In August 2008, certain Maple Leaf brand
    ready-to-eat (“RTE”) meats became contaminated with listeria monocytogenes at
    dangerous levels.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Some people fell seriously ill and some died after eating the meat. Maple Leaf recalled
    meats that were produced at the production plant where the infected meat
    originated, and the plant was temporarily closed. The recall and plant closure affected
    the supply of two of the RTE meats used by the franchisees of Mr. Submarine
    Ltd. (“Mr. Sub”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A class action was certified on behalf of Mr.
    Sub franchisees against Maple Leaf Foods Inc. and Maple Leaf Consumer Foods
    Inc. (collectively “Maple Leaf”).  The representative plaintiff, 1688782
    Ontario Inc., claims damages on the basis that Maple Leaf: (a) negligently
    manufactured and supplied potentially contaminated meat; and (b) negligently represented
    that the supplied meats were fit for human consumption. There is no evidence
    that any Mr. Sub customer was harmed by any contaminated product. However, the representative
    plaintiff alleges that the franchisees suffered economic losses arising in
    large part from the reputational harm they say they experienced from being
    publicly associated with Maple Leaf in the aftermath of the listeria outbreak.
    In particular, the representative plaintiff claims damages for loss of past and
    future sales, past and future profits, and loss of capital value and goodwill. It
    also claims damages for clean-up costs and other costs related to the disposal,
    destruction and replacement of RTE meats. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After certification of the class action, Maple
    Leaf brought a summary judgment motion seeking dismissal of certain claims on
    the basis that Maple Leaf owed no duty of care to the class. The representative
    plaintiff, in turn, asked that summary judgment be granted in its favour. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal arises from the motion judge’s decision
    concluding that Maple Leaf owed a duty of care to the franchisees “in relation
    to the production, processing, sale and distribution of the RTE Meats” and a
    duty of care “with respect to any representations made that the RTE Meats were
    fit for human consumption and posed no risk of harm.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Deloitte
    &amp; Touche v. Livent Inc. (Receiver of), </em>2017 SCC 63, [2017] 2 S.C.R.
    855, was released after this appeal was heard. The judgment has direct
    application to this case as it clarifies the analytical approach to identifying
    a duty of care, especially in the context of negligent misrepresentation claims.
    Accordingly, the parties were provided with the opportunity to file additional
    written submissions focused on the application of </span><em>Livent </em><span
lang=EN-US>to this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A franchise agreement governs the relationship
    between the franchisor, Mr. Sub, and its franchisees. The agreement requires
    the franchisees to purchase products exclusively from Mr. Sub or sources or
    suppliers approved by it. Although franchisees may purchase products not
    previously authorized by Mr. Sub, this may only be done with Mr. Sub’s approval.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the time of the listeria outbreak in 2008, Maple
    Leaf was in a contractual relationship with Mr. Sub. The agreement involved an
    exclusive supplier arrangement, whereby Mr. Sub contracted for 14 core menu
    items, including the two RTE meats relevant to this appeal, to be supplied only
    by Maple Leaf. However, under the terms of the agreement, Maple Leaf had no corresponding
    obligation to supply the RTE meats to Mr. Sub or its franchisees. At any time,
    Maple Leaf could have stopped supplying any or all of the 14 core menu items. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The franchisees did not buy the RTE meats directly
    from Maple Leaf. Instead, Maple Leaf dealt with distributors who, in turn,
    dealt with the franchisees. The franchisees would place their orders with, and
    be invoiced by, the distributors. Similarly, the distributors would place their
    orders with Maple Leaf and, in turn, be invoiced by Maple Leaf.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On August 7, 2008, the CFIA warned Maple Leaf
    that there might be an issue with some meats produced at one of its production
    plants. The CFIA’s warning did not relate to any of the products used by the
    franchisees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>More than a week later, on August 16, 2008 at
    10:00 p.m., Maple Leaf was informed that one of its products had tested
    positive for listeria. Within hours of notification, at 3:30 a.m. on August 17,
    2008, Maple Leaf issued a nationwide press release and notice of recall of two
    products. Neither of these were products used by the franchisees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On August 19, 2008, additional test results
    identified a potentially broader problem at the production plant where the
    infected meat had been produced. Maple Leaf expanded the voluntary recall to
    include two of the core menu items used by the franchisees - roast beef and
    corned beef. As tests continued to come back, Maple Leaf voluntarily decided to
    expand the recall, ultimately to 191 products, and then shut down the plant
    until the problem could be resolved. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is not in dispute that media reports dealing
    with the listeria outbreak drew an association between Maple Leaf and certain
    food sellers, including Mr. Sub and McDonalds. The CFIA’s “Health Hazard Alerts”
    also included reference to food brands and food sellers who used Maple Leaf
    products, including Mr. Sub, Boston Pizza, Compliments, Kirkland Signature,
    McDonalds, No Name, Pizza Nova, Safeway, Shopsy’s, and Tim Hortons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Maple Leaf communicated with Mr. Sub about the
    recall and sent communications to Mr. Sub intended for its franchisees. Maple
    Leaf set up a hotline to answer any questions that the franchisees may have had
    about the recall. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Maple Leaf also paid the distributors to attend
    at the franchisees’ restaurants to retrieve the two core menu items affected by
    the recall. Maple Leaf then credited the distributors for the retrieved products.
    Maple Leaf believed that the distributors then issued credits to the
    franchisees, although the representative plaintiff in this case maintains that it
    received no such credit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the plant was closed, Maple Leaf assisted Mr.
    Sub in finding a new supplier for the two recalled products. The new supplier was
    located by mid-September. By October, Maple Leaf was again producing the RTE meat
    products. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Sub sued Maple Leaf. The claim was settled
    when Maple Leaf paid Mr. Sub $250,000 and the parties entered into a Supply and
    Settlement Agreement, whereby Maple Leaf agreed to reduce the cost of the RTE
    meats sold to Mr. Sub and relieved Mr. Sub of the exclusive supply arrangement
    in certain circumstances. Maple Leaf believed that the price reductions would
    be passed on to Mr. Sub franchisees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The representative plaintiff maintains that Mr.
    Sub was the sole submarine sandwich restaurant identified by the media as a
    purveyor of Maple Leaf RTE meats. This association with Maple Leaf is said to
    have hurt the franchisees’ reputations and given their competitors a
    significant competitive advantage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The representative plaintiff suggests that
    customers did not want to come to Mr. Sub as a consequence of the listeria
    outbreak, or they would come in but then leave. In addition, in the affidavit
    evidence filed, it is suggested that it was not possible to purchase
    replacement products for the two recalled meats for six to eight weeks. In the
    meantime, the representative plaintiff had to explain to its customers why it
    did not have the requested product. It maintains that Maple Leaf’s negligence
    ultimately led to its demise as a viable business. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In its Amended Statement of Claim, the
    representative plaintiff pleads that “it was foreseeable that negligence on the
    part of [Maple Leaf] would result in a recall of all contaminated or
    potentially contaminated RTE Meats distributed to the [franchisees], and that
    such recall would be widely publicized and result in a loss of sales, profits
    and goodwill for the [franchisees].” It was also pleaded that the franchisees
    would be required “to take remedial measures including disposing or destroying
    of any contaminated or potentially contaminated RTE Meats to prevent harm to
    their customers or employees.”</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Decision Below</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Maple Leaf moved for summary judgment on the
    basis that Maple Leaf owed the representative plaintiff no duty of care. In the
    alternative, Maple Leaf sought a dismissal of the claims for damages arising
    out of pure economic loss, namely alleged loss of past and future sales, past
    and future profits, loss of capital value of the representative plaintiff’s
    franchise and business, and loss of goodwill.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The representative plaintiff requested an order
    for summary judgment on all of the issues on the defendant’s motion and was
    largely successful.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At para. 4 of her order, the motion judge
    ordered that Maple Leaf “owed a duty of care to [the franchisees] in relation to
    the production, processing, sale and distribution of the RTE Meats”. In her
    reasons, she described the duty as “a duty to supply a product fit for human
    consumption”: para. 40. She noted that her conclusion was consistent with three
    cases, which I will discuss in some detail below. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In support of her conclusion that Maple Leaf
    owed a duty to supply a product fit for human consumption, the motion judge found
    that Maple Leaf was “under an obligation to be mindful of the [representative]
    plaintiff’s legitimate interests in conducting its affairs”: para. 41.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In considering proximity, she noted that Maple
    Leaf was the exclusive supplier of RTE meats and the various dealings between
    Maple Leaf and the franchisees during the recall. She also noted that “RTE
    products were an integral and essential part of the business of the franchisees
    without which their business could not operate”: para. 42.  “The quality and
    safety of the RTE meats”, she found, “were essential to the maintenance of the
    franchisee’s good will and reputation … and if the RTE meats were contaminated
    they were potentially dangerous to consumers”: para. 42. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She further found that the alleged harm was a
    reasonably foreseeable consequence of Maple Leaf’s conduct: para. 43. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The motion judge went on to deal with the negligent misrepresentation
    claim. At para. 5 of her order, she ordered that Maple Leaf “owed a duty of
    care with respect to any representations made that the RTE meats were fit for
    human consumption and posed no risk of harm”. She discussed the negligent
    misrepresentation claim, at para. 49 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In relation to the defendants alleged representations that the
    RTE meats were fit for human consumption and posed no risk of harm, I find
    there was a “special relationship” between the plaintiff and [Maple Leaf] of the
    nature described in [<em>R v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</em>, 2011 SCC 42,
    [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45] because [Maple Leaf] ought reasonably to have foreseen that
    the plaintiff would rely on their representations and its reliance was
    reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    continued, at para. 50, as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The plaintiff is within a known and readily identifiable
    category of persons. [Maple Leaf] supplied the plaintiff, an entity it had a
    close and direct relationship with as its exclusive supplier, a defective
    product dangerous to public health, knowing that the product would be offered for
    sale to consumers who could be injured from consuming the product thereby
    causing economic losses to the plaintiff. There are no policy concerns arising
    from imposing a duty of care on the defendants in favour of the plaintiff and
    the class it represents. Rather, policy considerations weigh in favour of
    imposing a duty in these circumstances to heighten accountability. I disagree
    with the defendants that indeterminate liability is a concern here considering
    my findings in relation to the proximity requirement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Success
    on the motion was divided in that the representative plaintiff also claimed
    that Maple Leaf owed a duty to warn of the presence of listeria in its plant
    and the motion judge dismissed that claim. The representative plaintiff does
    not challenge that aspect of the motion judge’s order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span

lang=EN-US>I note that, in her reasons at para. 54, the motion judge declined
    to strike the claim for damages to cover disposal, destruction and clean-up
    costs as the “fact that the plaintiff does not have a claim for [these damages]
    does not entitle the defendants to an order striking these claims which the
    plaintiff makes on behalf of the class it represents”. On appeal, Maple Leaf
    does not challenge that aspect of the decision.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Maple Leaf maintains that the motion judge made
    a key finding of fact that was unsupported by the evidence and that this error
    led to her erroneous conclusion that a duty of care was owed. In particular,
    Maple Leaf points to the motion judge’s comment, at para. 50, that Maple Leaf “supplied
    the plaintiff … a defective product dangerous to public health”. Maple Leaf emphasizes
    that there is no evidence that any RTE meats contaminated with listeria reached
    the representative plaintiff’s store or that either of the two core menu items
    that were recalled ever tested positive for listeria. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The representative plaintiff says that the
    motion judge did not commit a palpable and overriding error. She did not find,
    says that representative plaintiff, that any meats provided to or recalled from
    the franchisees were contaminated. Rather, she properly found that the RTE
    meats that were provided to the franchisees were at risk of contamination and
    thus posed a risk to public health and safety. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the impugned comment must be read in
    the context of the motion judge’s reasons on the summary judgment motion and
    her related reasons on the certification motion. In particular, I note the comment
    at para. 40 of the motion judge’s certification reasons where she refers to “the
    risk of danger … that could occur from consumption of the product.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US> that the two core menu items </span><em>could</em><span lang=EN-US> compromise human health, given that they had been produced at the same plant as
    the tainted products. This is how the representative plaintiff encourages this
    court to read the impugned comment and, particularly in light of the high level
    of deference owed to the motion judge on findings of fact, I am prepared to do
    so. </span></p>

    finding proximity based upon a previously established or analogous category: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>… [W]here a party seeks to base a finding of proximity upon a
    previously established or analogous category, <span class=Underline>a court
    should be attentive to the particular factors</span> which justified
    recognizing that prior category in order to determine whether the relationship
    at issue is, in fact, truly the same as or analogous to that which was
    previously recognized. And, by corollary, <span class=Underline>courts should
    avoid identifying established categories in an overly broad manner</span> because, again, residual policy considerations are not considered where
    proximity is found on the basis of an established category (<em>Cooper</em>, at
    para. 39). … When, therefore, a court relies on an established category of
    proximity, it follows “that there are no overriding policy considerations that
    would [negate] the duty of care” (<em>ibid.</em>). A consequence of this
    approach, however, is that <span class=Underline>a finding of proximity based
    upon a previously established or analogous category must be grounded not merely
    upon the identity of the parties, but upon examination of the particular
    relationship at issue in each case</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    the plaintiffs provided pipeline systems to carry natural gas. The defendant
    sold a defective polyethylene resin to the plaintiffs for use in the pipes. The
    pipes cracked, natural gas escaped and an explosion occurred. The plaintiffs
    suffered financial hardship as a result and the defendant was held liable for damages

    imposing liability to deter manufacturers from engaging in such behaviour. Here,
    in contrast to the manufacturer in </span><em>Plas-Tex</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    which put a product into the marketplace that it knew to be dangerous, as soon
    as Maple Leaf knew its meat may be dangerous, it voluntarily recalled the

    patrons exposed to the foam suffered serious skin and eye irritation. The
    nightclub owner sued various parties involved in the manufacture and/or supply
    of the foam to the nightclub. The nightclub claimed that it suffered economic
    loss as a result of the defendants’ negligence. The trial judge described the
    claim as a claim “about lost drink sales, expenses associated with maintaining
    drink sales, and the loss of the opportunity to raise drink prices”: para. 225. </span></p>

    policy considerations, noting that they “weigh[ed] in favour of confirming a
    duty on the part of distributors and suppliers to the users of their product to
    ensure that the product is suitable and fit for its purpose and, to the extent
    that it carries hazards, adequate warnings are conveyed”: para. 153. The court

lang=EN-US>Finally, </span><em>Country Style</em> <span lang=EN-US>involved,
    among other things, a claim for damages for negligent misrepresentation arising
    out of the redesign of a shopping mall after a lease had been signed. Despite
    the lease being between the landlord and franchisor, the landlord was found to
    owe the franchisee a duty of care. This duty was breached when the landlord
    provided inaccurate site plans when the lease was negotiated.  Unlike this

    from this case where it is alleged that Maple Leaf should be held liable for damages
    for the reputational harm to the franchisees as a result of a recall and their public
    association with Maple Leaf. As a result, it is necessary to assess whether the
    motion judge’s conclusion that the relationship between Maple Leaf and the

    supply meat fit for human consumption, a duty which is aimed at protecting
    human health, was owed to the franchisees’ customers, not the franchisees.  The
    claim advanced against Maple Leaf in this action rests upon an alleged additional
    and quite different duty owed to franchisees to protect their reputation and
    pay for any consequent damages for pure economic losses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As noted by the motion judge, at para. 58, the
    alleged damages are, in large part, a consequence of the public announcement of
    the recall and resulting publicity. The alleged reputational damages are said
    to arise from publicity related to the illness and death of people who did not
    eat tainted meat at a Mr. Sub, and the recall of meat. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To conclude that Maple Leaf owed a duty of care
    in tort to the franchisees to protect them against the kinds of damages at
    issue on this appeal would be to enlarge the duty to safeguard the health and
    safety of customers by supplying fit meat to include a quite different and added
    duty to franchisees to protect against reputational harm. In my view, to do so
    would constitute an unwarranted expansion of a duty owed to one class of
    plaintiffs and extend it to the fundamentally different claim advanced by the
    franchisees. In other words, the franchisees cannot bootstrap their claim for
    damages for reputational loss to the different duty owed by Maple Leaf to their
    customers. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge found that it was “reasonable,
    appropriate, and foreseeable for consumers to avoid buying food from a
    restaurant where there had been a food recall arising from problems in the
    plant of its meat supplier that were not ‘resolved’ for a relatively
    significant period of time”: para. 48. However, this finding of reasonable
    foreseeability is not enough to give rise to a duty of care in tort to the
    franchisees which can only arise where the foreseeable harm falls within the
    scope of a proximate relationship.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Simply put, the type of injury claimed – economic
    losses arising from reputational harm – did not fall within the scope of any
    duty owed to the franchisees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of these conclusions, it is unnecessary
    to address the issue of whether there are any residual policy considerations
    that would negate the imposition of a duty of care. However, one point warrants
    brief mention.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge was of the view that imposing a
    duty in the circumstances of this case would heighten accountability. I agree
    that accountability is important but question whether imposing a duty in the

    concerns about safeguarding public health. </span></p>

    between the representative plaintiff and Maple Leaf, the motion judge referred
    to <em>Imperial Tobacco</em> in which the Supreme Court discussed the duty of
    care in the negligent misrepresentation context, at para. 42: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Proximity and foreseeability are heightened concerns in claims
    for economic loss, such as negligent misrepresentation… In a claim of negligent
    misrepresentation, both these requirements for a&nbsp;<em>prima facie&nbsp;</em>duty
    of care are established if there was a “special relationship” between the
    parties:<em>&nbsp;Hercules Managements</em>&nbsp;<em>Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young</em>,
    [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165, at para. 24.&nbsp; In&nbsp;<em>Hercules Managements</em>,
    the Court,&nbsp;<em>per</em>&nbsp;La Forest J., held that a special relationship
    will be established where: (1) the defendant ought reasonably to foresee that
    the plaintiff will rely on his or her representation; and (2) reliance by the
    plaintiff would be reasonable in the circumstances of the case (<em>ibid.</em>).&nbsp;
    Where such a relationship is established, the defendant may be liable for

lang=EN-US> the context of negligent misrepresentation cases, proximity is most
    usefully considered before foreseeability because “[w]hat the defendant reasonably
    foresees as flowing from his or her negligence depends upon the characteristics
    of his or her relationship with the plaintiff, and specifically … the purpose
    of the defendant’s undertaking”: </span><em>Livent, </em><span lang=EN-US>at
    para. 24. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While <em>Livent</em> affirms that when undertaking a full proximity analysis the
    court must examine all relevant factors arising out of the relationship between
    the plaintiff and the defendant, two factors are determinative in the case of
    negligent misrepresentation - the defendant’s undertaking and the plaintiff’s
    reliance: <em>Livent</em>, at para. 30. “Where the defendant undertakes to
    provide a representation or service in circumstances that invite the
    plaintiff’s reasonable reliance, the defendant becomes obligated to take
    reasonable care”: <em>Livent</em> at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to <em>Livent</em> at para. 31, “[a]ny reliance on the part of the plaintiff
    which falls outside of the scope of the defendant’s undertaking of
    responsibility – that is, of the purpose for which the representation was made
    or the service was undertaken – necessarily falls outside the scope of the
    proximate relationship and, therefore of the defendant’s duty of care”. <span
lang=EN-US>A defendant “cannot be liable for a risk of injury against which he
    did not undertake to protect”: </span><em>Livent, </em><span lang=EN-US>at
    para. 31. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cases of negligent misrepresentation, the proximate relationship informs the
    foreseeability inquiry in that “the purpose underlying [the] undertaking and
    [the] corresponding reliance limits the type of injury which could be
    reasonably foreseen to result from the defendant’s negligence”: <em>Livent</em>,
    at para. 34. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here<span lang=EN-US>, the motion judge found that Maple Leaf
    ought reasonably to have foreseen that the representative plaintiff would rely
    on its representation – namely, that the RTE meats were fit for human
    consumption and posed no risk of harm – and its reliance was reasonable in the
    circumstances. She noted that the representative plaintiff was within a known
    and readily identifiable category of persons and that Maple Leaf was the
    representative plaintiff’s exclusive supplier. Maple Leaf was aware that the
    RTE meats would be offered for sale to consumers who could be injured if it was
    unfit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, there was an error in failing to
    consider the </span><em>scope</em><span lang=EN-US> of the proximate relationship
    between the parties, which in turn affected the foreseeability analysis. Maple
    Leaf undoubtedly undertook – in the context of its contractual relationship with
    the franchisor – to supply meat safe for human consumption by Mr. Sub customers.
    The nature or purpose of such an undertaking was to ensure that Mr. Sub
    customers who ate RTE meats would not become ill or die as result of eating the
    meats. The purpose of the undertaking was not, however, to protect the
    reputational interests of the franchisees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The representative plaintiff maintains that it
    was reasonably foreseeable that the media would connect Mr. Sub to Maple Leaf’s
    listeria outbreak, causing reputational harm. As the motion judge put it at
    para. 37 of her reasons, the plaintiff alleged it was “tagged” as a place where
    dangerous products might have been sold prior to the recall.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The question is whether, in light of Maple Leaf’s undertaking, the
    representative plaintiff’s alleged reputational injury was reasonably
    foreseeable. In </span><em>Livent</em><span lang=EN-US>, the majority discussed
    reasonable foreseeability in the context of negligent misrepresentation, at
    para. 35:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>… [A] plaintiff has a right to rely on a defendant to act with
    reasonable care for the particular purpose of the defendant’s undertaking, and
    his or her reliance on the defendant for that purpose is therefore both
    reasonable and reasonably foreseeable. But a plaintiff has no right to rely on
    a defendant for any&nbsp;other purpose, because such reliance would fall
    outside the scope of the defendant’s undertaking.&nbsp; As such, any consequent
    injury could not have been reasonably foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Here, the plaintiff essentially says that, based on Maple Leaf’s
    representation, the franchisees relied on Maple Leaf to protect their reputations
    even in circumstances where the alleged reputational damage did not flow from
    the supply of tainted meat to Mr. Sub franchisees and harm to their customers,
    but rather from: (a) the supply of tainted meat </span><em>to others</em><span
lang=EN-US>; and (b) the </span><em>recall</em><span lang=EN-US> of </span><em>potentially
    tainted </em><span lang=EN-US>meat from Mr. Sub franchisees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree. <span lang=EN-US>The reputational damage said to be sustained by the
    plaintiff, arising from Maple Leaf’s supply to others and from the recall –
    aimed at safeguarding health and safety – falls outside the scope of Maple
    Leaf’s undertaking to the franchisees. Accordingly, the alleged injury was not
    reasonably foreseeable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of my conclusions on stage one of the </span><em>Anns/Cooper</em><span
