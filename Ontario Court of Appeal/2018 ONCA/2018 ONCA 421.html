  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Paul M. Perell of

  <p class=Judge><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These appeals arise out of the implementation of the Indian Residential
    Schools Settlement Agreement (2006) (the “IRSSA”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The IRSSA is a settlement agreement that resolved class actions and
    pending individual actions across Canada against the Attorney General of Canada
    and other parties implicated in the tragic history of physical, sexual and
    psychological abuse perpetrated on indigenous children at residential schools. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among other things, the IRSSA provides for financial compensation to
    these victims. All eligible class members who had resided in a residential
    school are entitled to payment of a minimum amount, called a “Common Experience
    Payment”. The IRSSA also provides that class members who allege they suffered
    serious physical, sexual or psychological harm at a residential school may
    apply for additional compensation through the Independent Assessment Process
    (“IAP”) – a comprehensive, tailor-made, private and confidential inquisitorial
    process established by the IRSSA for the resolution of such claims by specially
    trained adjudicators.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To facilitate the adjudicative function, the IAP requires the Government
    of Canada to search for and collect relevant documents and provide a report
    setting out the dates a claimant attended a residential school. Canada must
    provide a “person of interest” or “POI” report detailing information about
    alleged perpetrators of abuse, including their jobs at the residential school and
    the date they worked or attended there. Canada is also required to gather
    documents about the residential school that the claimant attended and provide
    the claimant with a report – a “School Narrative” or “School Report” – summarizing
    those documents. The IAP also contains provisions entitling the claimant to
    request copies of documents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal involves St. Anne’s Indian Residential School in Fort
    Albany, Ontario. St. Anne’s was the site of terrible abuse. Between 2000 and
    2003, 154 former students at St. Anne’s instituted 62 civil actions in
    Cochrane, Ontario against the Attorney General of Canada and other parties
    implicated in the abuse at St. Anne’s (the “Cochrane Actions”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Claimant H-15019, Claimant K-10106 and Edmund
    Metatawabin, former chief of the Fort Albany First Nation, were students at St.
    Anne’s. By the time of this appeal, H-15019 and K-10106 had received substantial
    awards under the IAP. Mr. Metatawabin did not make a claim under the IAP.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants brought broad-ranging Requests for Directions before the
    judge designated under the IRSSA’s Court Administration Protocol as the Eastern
    Administrative Judge. Among other things, they sought a declaration that Canada
    had breached its disclosure obligations under the IRSSA by refusing to produce
    transcripts of examinations for discovery from the Cochrane Actions (the
    “Cochrane Transcripts”), and relief for all former students affected by this
    alleged breach and other breaches by Canada of its disclosure obligations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The administrative judge dismissed H-15019’s Request for Directions
    (“RFD”). He concluded that Canada had not breached its disclosure obligations
    under the IRSSA by refusing to produce the Cochrane Transcripts to H-15019, who
    was not a plaintiff in any of the Cochrane Actions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case of K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin’s RFD, the administrative
    judge considered two preliminary issues: did they satisfy the test to obtain
    legal standing to bring their RFD and, if so, did the court have jurisdiction
    to provide the broad relief requested? The administrative judge concluded that
    K-10106 and Mr.  Metatawabin did not satisfy the test to obtain standing, the court
    did not have jurisdiction to grant most of the relief they sought, and, of the
    remaining items, there was no good reason for the court to exercise its
    jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal the orders dismissing their RFDs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that there is no basis to interfere with
    the administrative judge’s conclusions that Canada did not breach its
    disclosure obligations in refusing to produce the Cochrane Transcripts. Although,
    in relation to K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin’s RFD, I might have taken a
    different view from the judge on the issue of standing, there is no basis to
    interfere with his determinations on the issue of jurisdiction. Accordingly, I
    would dismiss these appeals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below,
    I provide background on the events leading to these RFDs. Then I address, in
    turn, H-15019’s appeal and K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin’s appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    courts play a limited but important role under the IRSSA. Article 18.04 of the
    IRSSA provides for application to the court for directions “in respect of the
    implementation, administration or amendment of [the IRSSA].” The right to bring
    a RFD is further contemplated by para. 31 of the Courts’ orders approving the
    IRSSA. RFDs are brought before one of the two Administrative Judges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    RFDs are not the first RFDs made to the administrative judge regarding Canada’s
    disclosure obligations under the IAP concerning St. Anne’s. As detailed in his
    reasons, in December of 2013, the administrative judge heard the first RFD on Canada’s
    disclosure obligations in relation to St. Anne’s: <em>Fontaine v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, 2014 ONSC 283, [2014] 2 C.N.L.R. 86 (“RFD-1”). In
    RFD-1, the applicants included 60 St. Anne’s claimants under the IAP. The focus
    was the over 12,000 documents obtained or created by the OPP in its criminal
    investigation of St. Anne’s between 1992 and 1996. That investigation
    culminated in charges against seven individuals, all but one of whom were
    convicted of some charge. Canada had obtained some of the documents arising from
    the OPP investigation on a motion brought in 2003 in connection with the
    Cochrane Actions. Its 2003 motion was resolved with the consent of the
    plaintiffs and with the church defendants not opposing.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his order dated January 14, 2014 (the “Order”), the administrative judge, among
    other things, ordered the OPP (which did not oppose the order sought) and
    Canada (which did, based on the deemed undertaking rule) to produce these OPP documents.
    The administrative judge concluded that the “deemed undertaking rule” did not
    apply to OPP documents in the possession of Canada or, if it did, the court
    should abrogate the undertaking to permit Canada to produce them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraphs
    6(b) and (c) of the Order are relevant to this appeal. They provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>6. THIS COURT ORDERS that Canada shall by June 30, 2014,
    produce for the IAP:</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) the transcripts of criminal or civil proceedings in its
    possession about the sexual and/or physical abuse at St. Anne’s IRS; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) any other relevant and non-privileged documents in the
    possession of Canada to comply with the proper reading and interpretation of
    Canada’s disclosure obligations under Appendix VIII [of the IAP].  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addressing the relief sought for Canada’s non-disclosure, the administrative
    judge held that the court had the jurisdiction to re-open settled claims, but
    that jurisdiction must be exercised on a case-by-case basis. He indicated that
    it would be a “rare or extraordinary” exercise of jurisdiction and there would
    need to be more than a “theoretical miscarriage of justice”: RFD-1, at paras.
    225 and 228. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Canada had not adequately complied with the IRSSA, the administrative judge
    concluded that Canada had simply misconstrued its disclosure obligations. He
    did not find that Canada had acted in bad faith, nor did he make any finding of
    reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of Canada: RFD-1,
    at para. 213; <em>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2014 ONSC 3059, [2014]
    O.J. No. 2400, at para. 26 (“RFD-1 Costs”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the second St. Anne’s RFD, <em>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2015
    ONSC 3611, [2015] 4 C.N.L.R. 51 (“RFD-2”), heard on May 20, 2015, the
    administrative judge agreed with the applicants that the IAP required Canada to
    update its POI and School Narrative reports for St. Anne’s to reflect the
    documents he ordered disclosed in his Order and to provide un-redacted copies
    of any court records, including transcripts and pleadings, that relate to
    criminal offences that were alleged to have occurred at St. Anne’s<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 30, 2014, Canada reported to the court on its compliance with the Order.
    It indicated that:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant to subparagraph 6(b), Canada would produce the
    transcripts of proceedings in its possession about the abuse at St. Anne’s, but
    Canada was not in possession of any civil trial transcripts in relation to St.
    Anne’s because no civil trials took place with respect to it.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pursuant to subparagraph 6(c), Canada would produce pleadings,
    demands for particulars, responses to those demands, notices of discontinuance,
    dismissal orders and other such documents from its St. Anne’s files.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If a claimant were examined for discovery in a previous residential
    school proceeding, Canada would produce the transcripts of the examination for
    the IAP hearing of the claimant, according to Appendix XI of the IAP model.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Canada would not otherwise produce transcripts of examinations
    for discovery because they are subject to settlement privilege or to deemed
    undertakings as to confidentiality that arose in the context of pre-IRSSA
    litigation.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019’S RFD</h1>
  <p class=Heading>The process leading to the order under appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 23, 2014, H-15019’s IAP claim was dismissed. The IAP provides that if
    a claimant is dissatisfied with the adjudicator’s decision, he or she may ask
    for review by another adjudicator, and if dissatisfied with the review, for a
    further review, referred to as a “re-review.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019
    sought a review by another adjudicator and, on April 2, 2015, the Review

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 2015, H-15109 filed a RFD seeking court intervention in his IAP claim.
    On February 11, 2016, he amended his claim. Among other things, he sought an
    order that redacted Cochrane Transcripts be produced and his IAP claim be
    re-heard “on all the proper evidence”. He also sought broad additional relief,
    including the payment of damages, the establishment of a process for review by
    counsel (whose legal fees would be paid by Canada) and the possible re-hearing
    of IAP claims of <span class=Underline>all</span> former students of St. Anne’s
    whose claims were decided prior to November 1, 2015, and the removal of the
    Department of Justice lawyers who represented Canada in all IAP re-hearing
    processes. H-15019 alleges that the Department of Justice lawyers withheld
    evidence, “hid” documents, and effected an abuse of process. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    administrative judge adjourned H-15019’s RFD to be brought on, if necessary,
    after his re-review hearing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    Chief Adjudicator of the IAP, in his capacity as the re-reviewing adjudicator,
    ordered a new hearing of H-15019’s IAP claim for reasons of procedural
    fairness. Without prejudice to its ability to challenge the legal issues raised
    by the Chief Adjudicator’s decision, Canada consented to a new hearing for H-15019
    and to the production of revised Narrative and POI Reports for consideration at
    the new hearing.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019
    sought guidance from the administrative judge regarding the new hearing. In
    particular, he questioned whether Canada was in compliance with the Order. The
    administrative judge convened a case conference. At the case conference, he
    directed that there should be a hearing in writing to determine whether Canada
    had breached its disclosure obligations under the IRSSA by refusing to produce
    the Cochrane Transcripts. He noted that Canada asserted that the production of
    the Cochrane Transcripts would be contrary to the letter and spirit of the
    IRSSA. The administrative judge indicated that if Canada had breached its
    disclosure obligations, the court would consider in a subsequent hearing
    whether “the various extraordinary requests for relief” should be granted.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The administrative judge’s reasons regarding H-15019’s RFD</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    administrative judge provided several reasons for his conclusion that Canada
    did not breach the IRSSA by refusing to produce the Cochrane Transcripts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he agreed with Canada that the reference to transcripts of civil proceedings in
    his Order did not include any and all transcripts of <span class=Underline>discovery
    evidence</span> from prior civil proceedings. He further noted that his Order
    provides that Canada is only required to produce relevant, non-privileged
    documents, which, he explained, suggests that the reference to transcripts of
    “civil proceedings” is meant to refer to proceedings where privilege and
    confidentiality issues do not apply. He further noted that transcripts from
    examinations for discovery are protected by the deemed undertaking and can only
    be used in subsequent proceedings in very limited circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    he concluded that the IRSSA does not impose a general obligation on Canada to
    produce examination for discovery transcripts. He reasoned as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The IAP Model created an express obligation to disclose
    examination for discovery transcripts in limited circumstances involving the
    direct participant in the IAP process. It provides that if a claimant gave
    evidence at discovery in a prior civil proceeding and now wishes to enter the
    IAP, he or she must disclose his or her transcript. In essence, a claimant must
    consent to certain uses of the discovery transcript, if the claimant makes an
    IAP claim.…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although as Claimant H–15109 notes, Canada is obligated under
    Appendix VIII of the IAP model to produce documents containing allegations of
    abuse, that obligation must be read in context and in a manner that is
    consistent with the IAP Model as a whole. Appendix XI of the IAP Model
    addresses the limited circumstances in which discovery transcripts can be used
    in IAP proceedings. To find that Appendix VIII imposes a general obligation on
    Canada to produce examination for discovery transcripts would be inconsistent
    with Appendix XI.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    he noted that H-15019 acknowledged that the deemed undertaking applied to the
    Cochrane Transcripts. He concluded that this was not a case where the deemed
    undertaking should be lifted. H-15019 was a non-party to the St. Anne’s
    litigation and to the undertakings given. The Supreme Court held in <em>Juman
    v. Doucette</em>, 2008 SCC 8, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 157, at para. 36, that consent to
    lift the undertaking will “virtually never be given” in cases where a non-party
    to the undertaking requests that the undertaking be lifted. The Cochrane
    Transcripts contain extremely sensitive and personal information, and
    disclosure should only be ordered if the interests of justice clearly outweigh
    the harm to the individual who provided the evidence. At his new hearing, H-15019
    will have the benefit of the additional information about St. Anne’s produced
    pursuant to the Order: all non-privileged, relevant documents in the St. Anne’s
    civil litigation including pleadings, demands for particulars, responses to
    those demands, and the OPP documents.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    he found that Canada had met the evidentiary burden of showing that the
    discoveries were communications made with a view to reconciliation or
    settlement and, accordingly, the Cochrane Transcripts were covered by
    settlement privilege. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis: H-15019’s appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019
    or Independent Counsel argue that: the deemed undertaking rule does not apply
    to the Cochrane Transcripts; if the deemed undertaking rule applies, it was
    overtaken by the terms of the IRSSA and the administrative judge’s
    interpretations of his Order and the IRSSA were clearly unreasonable; if the
    deemed undertaking rule applies to the Cochrane Transcripts and was not
    overtaken by the IRSSA, the administrative judge erred by failing to lift it;
    and the administrative judge had no evidentiary basis for concluding that
    discoveries were communications made with a view to reconciliation or
    settlement and, in any event, erred in law in finding that settlement privilege
    could extend to discovery transcripts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below,
    I first address Canada’s preliminary arguments that (1) this appeal has been
    rendered moot because a re-hearing of H-15019’s IAP application was conducted
    between the date the administrative judge released his reasons and the hearing
    of this appeal and he received a substantial award, and (2) to the extent not
    rendered moot, H-15019 does not meet the test for standing in <em>Fontaine v.
    Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2015 BCSC 1386, [2015] B.C.W.L.D. 6683 (the
    “Cachagee RFD”) to seek circulation of the Cochrane Transcripts into the IAP at
    large.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then
    I turn to the arguments of H-15019 and Independent Counsel.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A preliminary issue: Is H-15019’s appeal moot, and, if so, should the
    court exercise its discretion to hear his appeal? Does he have standing to
    pursue this appeal?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    re-hearing of H-15019’s IAP claim was conducted on July 12, 2017, after the
    administrative judge released his reasons dismissing his RFD, and with the
    benefit of the additional information about St. Anne’s that had been produced
    pursuant to the Order. H-15019 reasserted that he had suffered prolonged sexual
    abuse by a particular priest. Canada supported his claim. He was awarded
    compensation totaling $183,556.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If,
    subsequent to the initiation of a proceeding, events occur which affect the
    relationship of the parties so that no present live controversy exists which
    affects the rights of the parties, the case is said to be moot. A court may
    nonetheless elect to address a moot issue if the circumstances warrant: <em>Borowski
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at p. 353.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to H-15019, the only issue determined by the administrative judge (and
    the only issue argued on H-15019’s appeal) was whether Canada was required to
    disclose the Cochrane Transcripts. I agree with Canada that determining whether
    the administrative judge erred in concluding H-15019 was not entitled to
    disclosure of the Cochrane Transcripts will have no practical effect on H-15019’s
    rights. As indicated above, H-15019’s IAP claim has been re-heard. At the
    re-hearing, the adjudicator accepted his story and determined that he had
    suffered a level of sexual abuse that entitled him to the highest level of
    compensation. I do not see how further disclosure could impact him.<a
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[4]</span></span></span></a> Hence, his RFD, to the extent it seeks relief personal to him is moot. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, the circumstances warrant the court hearing H-15019’s appeal.
    Unquestionably, an adversarial relationship continues to prevail between the
    appellants and Canada. All appear, represented by counsel. Further, judicial
    economy favours determining these issues: H-15019’s appeal has been briefed and
    argued; and K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin also sought an order for disclosure of
    the Cochrane Transcripts in their RFD, the administrative judge invoked his
    determination regarding disclosure of the Cochrane Transcripts in his reasons
    on their RFD, and I conclude below that at least K-10106 had standing.
    Moreover, H-15019 sought relief in relation to other affected St. Anne’s
    survivors, and not just himself. In the circumstances, I do not think that
    determining the issues would be viewed as a departure from the court’s
    traditional role. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    reject Canada’s argument that H-15019 no longer has standing and we should
    decline to hear his appeal on that basis. He had standing when he brought his
    RFD. Although intervening events may remove the very foundation of the
    controversy between parties, such as in <em>Borowski</em>, this has not happened
    here. Many of the circumstances that existed when H-15019 brought his RFD
    continue to exist, such as those that warrant the court hearing the appeal
    under the mootness analysis. I therefore move beyond these preliminary issues
    to consider the appeal on its merits. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does the deemed undertaking rule apply to the Cochrane Transcripts? </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Doucette</i>, the Supreme Court explained the rationale and scope of the
    deemed (or “implied”) undertaking rule. The root of the undertaking is the
    statutory compulsion to participate in pre-trial discovery: <em>Doucette</em>, at
    para. 20. The rule provides that evidence compelled during pre-trial discovery
    from a party to civil litigation can be used by parties only for the purpose of
    the litigation for which it was obtained, unless and until the scope of the
    undertaking is varied by judicial order or a situation of immediate and serious
    danger emerges: <em>Doucette</em>, at paras. 1 and 3. In this way, the rule
    provides a measure of protection to the examinee’s privacy interest. It also provides
    some assurance to the examinee that his or her documents and answers will not
    be used for a collateral purpose. This encourages a more complete and candid
    discovery: <em>Doucette</em>, at paras. 25-26. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    is among the jurisdictions that have enacted rules more or less codifying the
    common law deemed undertaking rule. Rule 30.1.01 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 provides that the parties and their lawyers are deemed to
    undertake not to use discovery evidence “for any purposes other than those of
    the proceeding in which the evidence was obtained.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019
    disputes that he acknowledged before the administrative judge that the deemed
    undertaking applies to the Cochrane Transcripts. He argues that the Cochrane
    Actions are the same proceeding as IAPs under the IRSSA, and that the
    administrative judge made this finding in RFD-1. Therefore, the deemed
    undertaking rule does not restrict the use of the Cochrane Transcripts in IAPs
    under the IRSSA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Independent
    Counsel advance a different argument. They argue that the deemed undertaking in
    r. 30.1.01(3) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em> does not apply because
    r. 30.1.01(7) specifically permits the use of discovery evidence in subsequent
    proceedings in accordance with r. 31.11(8), and r. 31.11(8) applies in these
    circumstances. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject these arguments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019
    did not provide a copy of his submissions before the administrative judge
    regarding the applicability of the deemed undertaking rule. However, assuming
    that the administrative judge was mistaken that H-15019 acknowledged that the
    deemed undertaking applies to the Cochrane Transcripts, I do not agree that any
    and all IAPs of St. Anne’s survivors are the “proceeding in which the evidence
    was obtained”, within the meaning of r. 30.1.01(3). The discovery evidence at
    issue was obtained in 62 distinct civil actions instituted in Cochrane by 154
    survivors of St. Anne’s. H-15019 was not a plaintiff in any of the Cochrane
    Actions. He argues that the evidence of a survivor obtained in a civil
    proceeding commenced by that survivor can be used for the purpose of an IAP of
    a different survivor because they are the same proceeding. In my view, they are
    clearly not the same proceeding. They involve different claimants. To the
    extent that the administrative judge concluded otherwise in RFD-1, I respectfully
    disagree with him.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    30.1.01(7) provides that the deemed undertaking in r. 30.1.01(3) “does not
    prohibit the use of evidence or information in accordance with subrule 31.11(8)
    (subsequent action).” Rule 31.11(8) provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(8) SUBSEQUENT ACTION – Where an action has been discontinued
    or dismissed and another <span class=Underline>action involving the same
    subject matter is subsequently brought between the same parties or their
    representatives</span> or successors in interest, the evidence given on an
    examination for discovery taken in the former action may be read into or used
    in evidence at the trial of the subsequent action as if it had been taken in
    the subsequent action. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    31.11(8) is inapplicable. Most of the Cochrane Actions settled before the advent
    of the IRSSA. No other actions could be or were subsequently brought in
    relation to the subject matter of those settled actions. As to the remaining
    Cochrane Actions, if an IAP claim is an “action” within the meaning of that
    term in r. 31.11(8), the “action…subsequently brought” is the IAP claim made by
    a particular survivor, and not, as Independent Counsel argues, any and all IAP
    claims made under the IRSSA. The parties in any and all IAPs would not be the
    same as in a civil action commenced by a particular St. Anne’s survivor.
    Similarly, the “subject matter” would not be the same. The subject matter would
    be different abuse perpetrated on different persons, possibly by different
    perpetrators.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the administrative judge’s interpretation of the Order and the IRSSA

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
    a deferential standard of review also applies to the administrative judge’s

    abuse, Appendix VIII provides, in relevant part, that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Upon request, the Claimant or their lawyer will receive copies

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019

    discovery transcripts can be used in IAP proceedings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    administrative judge did not err in his approach. Interpretation of written
    contractual provisions must be grounded in the text and read in light of the
    entire contract: see SCC Archives, at para. 37. He properly read the general
    language in Appendix VIII in light of Appendix XI, which sets out specific
    rules for the use of pre-existing evidence in the IAP.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the fact that strict confidentiality of the IAP was intended and that nobody
    except the survivor was meant to have access to the story of the survivor are
    “surrounding circumstances” that may be considered in interpreting the IRSSA: SCC
    Archives, at paras. 42-43. The interpretation argued by H-15019 would
    potentially permit others to have access to the story of a survivor.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span

    reasons that are the subject of this appeal, he rejected it in an earlier
    decision regarding the disposition of documents created within the IAP: <em>Fontaine
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2014 ONSC 4585, 122 O.R. (3d) 1 (“SCJ
    Archives”). On appeal, this court noted that the administration judge accepted
    “that preservation of records, even in an “anonymized” form, could potentially
    result in identification of perpetrators and survivors in small Aboriginal
    communities, causing lasting and irreparable harm to future generations”: <em>Fontaine
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2016 ONCA 241, 130 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 69
    (“OCA Archives”). And in SCC Archives, at para. 47, the SCC recognized the
    administrative judge’s concern and the risk that disclosure could result in
    deep discord within communities, noting the evidence of one claimant that her
    community was “so small and close” that she could be easily identified even
    were her name omitted. At para. 46, the Supreme Court also characterized the
    nature of the information disclosed during IAPs as “the most sensitive and
    private in nature”. This description is equally applicable to information in
    the Cochrane Transcripts. The provision for redaction in the IAP is not a basis
    to interfere with the administrative judge’s decision not to lift the deemed
    undertaking.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>H-15019
    also argues that there was no evidentiary foundation for the administrative
    judge’s comment at para. 19 of the reasons below that, “in any event, the
    informational content of the [Cochrane Transcripts] ...is more or less
    available from the publicly available court documents in the civil cases or by
    the 12,000 Cochrane documents already produced.” In making this argument, I
    take Claimant H-15019 to suggest that the administrative judge erred in his
    assessment of the interests of justice in lifting the undertaking. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I note that in the portion of the administrative judge’s reasons where he
    specifically considers whether he should exercise his discretion to lift the
    deemed undertaking, the administrative judge simply writes that Claimant H-15019
    will have the benefit of the additional information about St. Anne’s produced
    pursuant to the Order: all non-privileged, relevant documents in the St. Anne’s
    civil litigation including pleadings, demands for particulars and responses to
    those demands, and the OPP documents. There is no doubt that these documents
    provided considerable additional information. Having presided at RFD-1 and
    RFD-2, the administrative judge presumably had a good sense of their reach. In
    my view, he was entitled to consider the fact that considerable information was
    already available to Claimant H-15019 in determining whether the interests of
    justice outweighed the prejudice to the examinees of setting aside the deemed
    undertaking and providing further disclosure to him. His assessment of the
    interests of justice was not infected by a palpable and overriding error. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Doucette</em> cautions at para. 38 that, “an undertaking should only be set aside in exceptional
    circumstances”. As the administrative judge highlighted in his reasons, this is
    a case where a non-party sought to lift the undertaking. In my view, the
    administrative judge gave sufficient weight to all relevant considerations and
    his exercise of discretion not to order disclosure was not based on an
    erroneous principle. There is no basis for this court to interfere with his
    exercise of discretion.</p>
  <h2>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are the Cochrane Transcripts protected by Settlement Privilege?</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    of communications exchanged by parties with the intent of settling a dispute is

    evidentiary rule is to promote honest and frank discussions between the parties
    and thereby promote settlement: see <em>Sable Offshore Energy v. Ameron
    International Corp.</em>, 2013 SCC 37, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 623, at paras. 2, 12 and
    13; <em>Union Carbide Canada Inc. v. Bombardier Inc.</em>, 2014 SCC 35, [2014]

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 34 of his reasons, the administrative judge wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In 2005, the parties to the civil proceedings negotiated a
    settlement, and it was a term of this settlement that if a plaintiff had not
    already been examined for discovery, then he or she would be examined for
    discovery for the purposes of negotiating the quantum of the settlement. All
    the examinations for discovery were made part of the settlement process.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 124, the administrative judge agreed with Canada that the Cochrane
    Transcripts were covered by settlement privilege and disagreed with Claimant
    H-15019 that Canada had not met the evidentiary burden of showing that the
    discoveries were communications made with a view to settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated above, H-15019 and Independent Counsel’s submissions are two-fold:
    (1) there was no evidentiary basis for the facts found by the administrative
    judge at para. 34 of his reasons and, in any event, (2) settlement privilege
    covers negotiations, and does not extend to examinations for discovery, which
    by their nature are for the purpose of eliciting evidence as to facts.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have concluded that there is no basis to interfere with the administrative
    judge’s assumption that the deemed undertaking rule applied to the Cochrane
    Transcripts; his conclusion that the IRSSA and his Order do not override the
    deemed undertaking rule and, except as provided in Appendix XI, provide for
    disclosure of the Cochrane Transcripts; or his decision not to lift the deemed
    undertaking. Accordingly, I need not determine whether there was an adequate
    basis for the administrative judge’s finding at para. 34 and leave for another
    day whether “examinations for discovery [that were] part of the settlement
    process”, as described by the administrative judge at para. 34 of his reasons,
    are covered by settlement privilege because they are connected to the
    negotiations.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span

  <p class=Heading>The administrative judge’s reasons on the standing and
    jurisdiction issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    administrative judge noted that para. 31 of the Courts’ orders approving the
    IRSSA contemplates that specified persons and entities “or such other person or
    entity” as the court may allow, “after fully exhausting the dispute resolution
    mechanisms contemplated in the [IRSSA]”, may apply to the court for directions
    in respect of implementation, administration or amendment of the IRSSA on
    notice to all affected parties. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K-10106
    and Mr. Metatawabin are not among the specified persons or entities. Therefore,
    the question was whether the administrative judge should grant them standing to
    bring their RFD.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    applied the three-part test for standing to bring an RFD formulated by Brown J.
    in the Cachagee RFD: (1) is there a serious issue to be tried; (2) is the
    person or entity directly affected by or does it have a genuine interest in the
    issues raised; and (3) is there another reasonable and effective manner by
    which the issue can be brought before the court?  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    administrative judge concluded that they did not satisfy any of the elements of
    the Cachagee test. While K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin raise serious issues to be
    tried, “the serious issues are not their issues but rather personal issues
    between an IAP claimant and his or her lawyer and these personal complaints are
    outside the purview of the IRSSA and the IAP”. Further, they have no personal
    interest in the serious issues raised in the RFD. Finally, there is a
    reasonable and effective manner by which their claims of solicitors’ negligence
    and breach of fiduciary duty can be brought before the court: normative
    litigation outside of the IRSSA.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    acknowledged that Mr. Metatawabin had previously been granted standing in other
    RFDs, but his standing had not been challenged in those RFDs and there were
    others who had standing to advance the RFD. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    administrative judge went on to conclude that, in any event, the court did not
    have, or should not exercise, jurisdiction to grant the relief sought given:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It has already been judicially determined that the court does not

  <p class=Heading>K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin’s position</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>K-10106
    and Mr. Metatawabin agree that the administrative judge applied the correct
    test in determining whether they should be granted standing. They argue that he
    erred in his application of that test. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    say that he erred by focusing on their complaints regarding the lawyers. The
    predominate relief they requested was for the court to issue directions with
    respect to, and provide a remedy to, all St. Anne’s survivors whose IAP claims
    were based on an incomplete and, therefore, false factual foundation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    argue that there is no other reasonable and effective manner in which the
    issues they raise can be brought before the court. They submit that in concluding
    otherwise, the administrative judge failed to consider the particularly
    vulnerable nature of the St. Anne’s survivors, the fact that Mr. Metatawabin
    and PKKA are their chosen representatives, and the difficulty of notifying the
    St. Anne’s survivors of “Canada’s violations of the IRSSA”. They say that
    because of the confidentiality of the IAP process, only the Chief Adjudicator
    is in a position to notify claimants. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    they argue that the administrative judge wholly disregarded the United Nations
    Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which, it argues, confirms the
    right of PKKA, as the chosen representatives of the St. Anne’s survivors, to
    bring its RFD. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the issue of jurisdiction, K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin argue that, in light
    of Canada’s non-disclosure, the court has ample jurisdiction to direct an
    independent review of all claims of St. Anne’s survivors based upon the full
    evidentiary record with each claimant entitled to elect a full rehearing should
    he or she choose to do so, and to order Canada to pay the costs of independent
    legal advice and health support services for each such claimant. Their
    submissions make clear that their RFD seeks more than directions about a
    process whereby individual St. Anne’s survivors might advance requests for
    case-by-case re-hearings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin do not challenge any of the administrative
    judge’s other findings on the jurisdiction issue.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin that, given the broad scope of their
    RFD, the administrative judge’s standing analysis was tainted by his focus on
    their complaints regarding the lawyers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated above, K-10106 and Mr. Metatawabin seek an order that all St. Anne’s
    survivors are entitled to a full re-hearing and K-10106 is a St. Anne’s
    survivor whose claim was determined before the additional disclosure that was
    the subject of RFD-1 and RFD-2 was produced. She is directly affected or has a
    genuine interest in that issue, and in the issue of the production of the
    Cochrane Transcripts. Mr. Metatawabin, who did not make a claim under the IAP,
    is not personally affected by the request for re-hearings. However, he is an
    executive member of PKKA, which represents St. Anne’s survivors, and sought
    funding on behalf of PKKA. In that sense, he might be said to have a genuine interest.
    Further, unlike the issues relating to the lawyers, the issue of entitlement to
    re-hearings is not an issue that should be litigated outside the IRSSA. I would
    have granted standing to K-10106, and, possibly, to Mr. Metatawabin. However,
    this does not affect the outcome of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the administrative judge noted, he had determined in RFD-1 that although the
    court had the jurisdiction to re-open settled claims as a result of a breach of
    Canada’s disclosure obligations, that jurisdiction must be exercised on a
    case-by-case basis and that, in each case, more than “a theoretical miscarriage
    of justice” must be shown. RFD-1 was not appealed.<a href="#_ftn7"

    administrative judge considered whether the court should exercise its
    jurisdiction to order a re-hearing in the specific case of K-10106. He
    concluded that, in the case of K-10106, “there is no reason to believe that the
    outcome of the IAP process was unjust or that the extraordinary circumstances
    for court intervention exist.” In particular, he found that there is no basis
    to believe that the absence of the documents affected the outcome of her claim.
    K-10106 was successful and received a substantial award within the parameters
    of the IAP. “The amount of her award was determined by her own story, her own
    experience, her own injuries, and this evidence was before the Adjudicator
    because Claimant K-10106 had the courage and perseverance to tell her story.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span

    regarding this issue and concluded that procedural fairness was not an implied
    term in the IRSSA: <i>Fontaine v Canada (Attorney General)</i>, 2018 BCSC 63, [2018]
    B.C.J. No. 55. IAP claims cannot be re-opened by the Chief Adjudicator and his
    designates, as H-15019’s IAP claim was re-opened, on the basis of a denial
    procedural fairness uncovered by new evidence. This decision did not affect
    already re-opened IAP claims, such as H-15019’s claim.</p>

    a scale of 1 to 5. It also awards compensation for severe physical abuse, other
    wrongful acts, loss of opportunity, and future care. Compensation points can be
    increased by 5-15% for aggravating factors. The adjudicator believed H-10519’s
    account and gave him the highest level of compensation points, and the largest aggravating
    factor allowance. The categories in which H-15019 did not receive the top level
    of compensation points involved the ongoing effects of the terrible abuse
    H-15019 suffered. Disclosure of the Cochrane Transcripts would not have
    affected these categories.</p>

    evidence of a survivor in his or her own IAP. Indeed, as discussed below, Appendix
    XI of the IAP specifically recognizes this.</p>
