  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard: April 20, 2018</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Thomas R. Lofchik
    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated September 14, 2017, with reasons
    reported at 2017 ONSC 5396.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Benotto J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sole issue in this appeal is whether a “Results
    Achieved Fee” charged by the appellant law firm in a family law matter is a
    prohibited contingency fee agreement under the </span><em>Solicitors Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 15 (the “</span><em>Act</em><span lang=EN-US>”).
    I have concluded that the fee is a contingency fee agreement within the meaning
    of the </span><em>Act</em><span lang=EN-US> and is thus prohibited. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Facts </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent retained the appellant, Stephen
    Durbin and Associates, to represent him in family law litigation. The primary
    issue was the custody of the respondent’s 6-year old daughter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent signed a retainer agreement
    outlining hourly rates, daily fees for court appearances and an automatic
    yearly increase of 15% with respect to those fees. The retainer agreement also
    provided for “an increase in fees in the event of a positive result achieved
    (‘Results Achieved Fee’).”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was a police officer, then
    earning about $96,000 per year. He depleted his retainer funds of $10,000 and
    began accruing arrears. He signed a direction that any funds payable to him
    from the litigation would be paid to the appellant in trust and the appellant
    would deduct outstanding fees from those funds.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After a lengthy trial, the respondent was
    awarded sole custody of the child, half of the proceeds of sale of the
    matrimonial home and costs of $192,000. The funds were all payable to the
    appellant pursuant to the direction. The appellant received $423,510.47 in
    trust representing the respondent’s share of the proceeds of sale from the
    matrimonial home plus the costs award. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant deducted $132,597.74 from the
    trust to satisfy the outstanding account. The appellant also unilaterally deducted
    a Results Achieved Fee of $72,433.24. It is unclear on the record how the
    appellant arrived at this amount. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent did not object to the deduction
    of fees to satisfy the outstanding account. He did, however, object to the Results
    Achieved Fee. He sought to have it assessed, but the assessment officer
    concluded that a judge would have to decide the matter as a question of law. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge determined that the Results
    Achieved Fee is a contingency fee agreement as defined by the </span><em>Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>, and thus is a prohibited charge.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Statutory context </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The </span><em>Act </em><span lang=EN-US>provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Purchase of interest prohibited</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>28 A solicitor shall
    not enter into an agreement by which the solicitor purchases all or part of a

  <p class=CQuote><strong>Contingency fee agreements</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>28.1&nbsp;(1) A solicitor may enter into a contingency fee
    agreement with a client in accordance with this section. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Remuneration dependent on success</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) A solicitor may enter into a contingency fee agreement that
    provides that the remuneration paid to the solicitor for the legal services
    provided to or on behalf of the client is <span class=Underline>contingent, in
    whole or in part, on the successful disposition or completion of the matter</span> in respect of which services are provided. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>No contingency fees in certain matters</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) <span class=Underline>A solicitor shall not enter into a

  <p class=CQuote>(b) <span class=Underline>a family
    law matter</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>PARTIES’ POSITIONS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the Results Achieved
    Fee is not a contingency fee agreement, but rather a permissible “premium” or
    “bonus”. It points to two features that it claims distinguish the two. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, under the retainer agreement, the
    respondent was liable to pay the appellant’s fees regardless of the outcome at
    trial. The appellant argues that contingency fee agreements are limited to
    those wherein the lawyer only receives compensation for a successful result. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the Results Achieved Fee was linked to
    success at trial, not the specific monetary result. The appellant argues that
    the public policy concerns that give rise to the prohibition against
    contingency fee agreements in family law matters do not arise where the
    lawyer’s fee is not tied to a fixed portion of the monetary result. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant relies on a series of civil law
    cases, including </span><em>Teplitsky, Colson v. McCrea</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [2008] O.J. No. 6014 (S.C.)</span></em><em>.</em><span
lang=EN-US> There the client’s fee arrangement in an employment matter provided
    it would be augmented to include a percentage of the recovery that exceeded a
    certain offer to settle. In determining whether this constituted a contingency
    fee agreement, Strathy J. (as he then was) distinguished between a “bonus” in
    the event of success and a contingency fee agreement. At paras. 77-78, he
    stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>There has been no
    authority cited to me …other than the statute itself, for the interpretation of
    Section 28 to apply to agreements which are not in and of themselves
    conditional on success, but which contain a bonus in the event of success. This
    agreement provided for a fee in any event, but a bonus calculated on a
    percentage basis in the event of success. Nor is any authority cited for the
    proposition that it is the charging of a percentage that makes the agreement
    objectionable.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>While contingency
    fee agreements are frequently based on a percentage, the calculation of a part
    of the lawyer’s compensation by reference to a percentage, does not make the
    agreement bad as a contingency fee agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The appellant also relies on </span></em><em>Warnica
    v. Van Moorlehem</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2012 ONSC 4241, in which clients agreed
    to pay an amount “equal to 30% of the amount recovered in the action brought on
    their behalf.” Relying on </span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar>Teplitsky</span><span
lang=EN-US>, Quigley J. rejected that the mere payment of percentage-based
    remuneration renders an agreement a contingency fee agreement. He stated, at
    para. 33: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>So the question is, just what is a
    contingency agreement? Is every agreement involving the payment of
    percentage-based remuneration to the solicitor, based upon the amount received
    in damages at the end of a trial or settlement negotiation a contingency fee
    agreement? Clearly the answer is no. Regardless of whether percentage
    compensation may be paid in whole or in part, the only fee arrangements which
    will fall within the definition are those embraced by section 28 of the <em>Solicitors
    Act</em> where the solicitor effectively purchases all or part of the client’s
    interest and potential success in the action. The mere calculation of a part of
    a lawyer’s compensation by reference to a percentage does not necessarily makes
    the agreement bad as a contingency fee agreement, and thus require the
    protections enacted in the statute and the Regulations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Quigley concluded that the agreement at issue was a contingency fee agreement
    since, under the plain terms of the agreement, the solicitor would receive no
    fees for his services unless an amount was recovered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent takes the position that the
    application judge was correct in finding that the Results Achieved Fee was a
    contingency fee agreement in contravention of the </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Act</span><span lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I will explain, the appellant’s position is
    outdated and does not accord with the current provisions of the </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Act</span><span lang=EN-US>. The </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Act</span><span lang=EN-US> was amended in 2004 to
    include the phrase “contingent, in whole or in part” on a successful outcome.
    Consequently, a premium or bonus added on to a lawyer’s fee is captured by the
    meaning of contingency fee agreement and is thus prohibited by s. 28.1(3)(b). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To demonstrate the meaning of a contingency fee
    agreement, I first consider the plain and ordinary meaning of the words in the </span><em>Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>; I then consider the broader statutory context. I conclude that a
    contingency fee agreement is an agreement under which </span><span
class=Underline>any part</span><span lang=EN-US> of a lawyer’s compensation is
    tied to the successful resolution of the matter for which the lawyer was
    retained. Accordingly, the Results Achieved Fee is a contingency fee agreement
    and is prohibited by the </span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar>Act</span><span
lang=EN-US>. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The modern approach to statutory interpretation is
    well established. The words of an act or provision “are to be read in their
    entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with
    the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: </span><em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1998] 1
    S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, quoting E. A. Driedger, </span><em>Construction of

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is presumed that the legislature does not
    intend to produce absurd consequences, such as rendering some aspect of a
    statute pointless or futile: </span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar>Rizzo</span><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 27. It is further presumed “that the legislature avoids
    superfluous or meaningless words” and “does not … speak in vain”: </span><span

  <h6><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The grammatical and ordinary meaning </span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 15 of the </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Act</span><span lang=EN-US> defines a contingency fee
    agreement as “an agreement referred to in section 28.1”. Section 28.1(2), reproduced
    in its entirety above, describes a contingency fee</span><span lang=EN-US> </span>agreement
    as one that provides the remuneration paid to a solicitor for legal services is
    contingent <span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span style='text-decoration:none'>in
    whole or in part</span></span><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em>on
    the successful disposition or completion of the matter for which the services
    were provided.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I make several observations regarding the grammatical and
    ordinary meaning of the words in this provision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, <span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span style='text-decoration:
none'>all</span></span> of the lawyer’s remuneration need not be contingent on
    success. Section 28.1(2) explicitly captures agreements where only “<span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span style='font-style:normal;text-decoration:
none'>part”</span></span> of a lawyer’s remuneration is contingent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the legislature’s inclusion of the language “in whole <span
class=Underline>or in part</span>” (emphasis added) must be given real meaning
    and must not be “interpreted so as to render it mere surplusage”: <span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>R. v. Proulx</span>, 2000 SCC 5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61,
    at para. 28. This clear legislative language provides reason to depart from
    this court’s statement in <span class=EmphasisStrongChar>McIntyre</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lastly, s. 28.1(2) stipulates that remuneration must be “contingent”
    on the “successful disposition or completion of the matter”. It does not
    specify that the lawyer’s fees must be tied to – or “contingent” on – the
    specific monetary result. It is broader in scope.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on these observations, the grammatical and ordinary wording
    of the relevant provisions does not support limiting contingency fee agreements
    to those in which (i) a lawyer’s fees are only payable in the event of success
    and/or (ii) a lawyer’s fees are calculated by reference to the specific
    monetary result – as urged by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor does the broader context support such an interpretation. </p>
  <h6><span lang=EN-US>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The entire context </span></h6>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the application judge failed to consider
    whether the appellant had purchased all or part of the respondent’s interest in
    the action pursuant to s. 28 of the </span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar>Act</span><span
lang=EN-US>. It claims that this was a necessary analysis, since contingency
    fee agreements permitted by s. 28.1(2) are those referred to in s. 28. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>This interpretation is consistent with the line of analysis adopted
    in </span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar>Teplitsky</span><span lang=EN-US> and </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Warnica</span><span lang=EN-US>. For example, in </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Warnica</span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Quigley J. described
    s. 28.1 as “the exception to the antecedent stipulation” in s. 28 (at para. 29)
    and held, at para 33:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he only fee arrangements which
    will fall within the definition [of a contingency agreement] are those embraced
    by section 28 of the <em>Solicitors Act</em> where the solicitor effectively
    purchases all or part of the client’s interest and potential success in the
    action.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect, I do not agree that s. 28 defines or limits
    contingency fee agreements in this manner, nor acts as a necessary antecedent. For
    one thing, this interpretation is contrary to the express language of s. 15,
    which defines contingency fee agreements as those referred to in s. 28.1 (not
    s. 28). More importantly, this interpretation <span lang=EN-US>overlooks the context
    of ss. 28 and 28.1 and how they have developed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Historically, courts in Ontario held that
    lawyers’ contingency fee agreements were champertous and unenforceable: </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>McIntyre</span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 49</span></span><span lang=EN-US>. As this
    court explained in </span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar>McIntyre</span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar><span style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 26,</span> </span><span
lang=EN-US>champerty at common law was directed at: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[T]hose who, for
    an improper motive, often described as wanton or officious intermeddling,
    become involved with disputes (litigation) of others in which the maintainer
    has no interest whatsoever and where the assistance he or she renders to one or
    the other parties is without justification or excuse … [and] the maintainer
    shares in the profits of the litigation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1897, the Ontario legislature enacted <em>An Act Respecting
    Champerty</em>, R.S.O. 1897, c. 327 (the “<span class=EmphasisStrongChar>Champerty
    Act</span>”), codifying that: “All champertous agreements are forbidden, and
    invalid.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Over time, rising litigation costs and concerns about access to
    justice resulted in a shift in attitude towards contingency fee agreements: </span><em>McIntyre</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 55. In 2004, the legislature amended the </span><span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Act</span> <span lang=EN-US>to permit contingency fees
    in certain circumstances pursuant to s. 28.1. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>While contingency fee agreements are now permitted, the champertous </span>purchase
    of a client’s interest in litigation remains prohibited and the <em>Champerty
    Act</em> remains in effect<span lang=EN-US>. </span>Section 28 relates to this
    separate and distinct prohibition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    distinctness of s. 28 from s. 28.1 is evident from the legislative evolution of
    s. 28. Prior to the 2004 amendments, s. 28 read as follows: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Nothing … gives validity to a purchase by a solicitor of the
    interest or any part of the interest of his or her client in any action or
    other contentious proceeding to be brought or maintained, <span
class=Underline>or gives validity to an agreement by which a solicitor retained
    or employed to prosecute an action or proceeding stipulates for payment only in
    the event of success in the action or proceeding, or where the amount to be
    paid to him or her is a percentage of the amount or value of the property
    recovered or preserved or otherwise determinable by such amount or value or
    dependent upon the result of the action or proceeding</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2004, the legislature removed the reference in s. 28 to agreements stipulating
    for payment in the event of success, tied to a percentage of recovery, determinable
    by the amount recovered, or dependent on the result of the action. These are
    contingency fee agreements now permitted in accordance with s. 28.1. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the legislature left the reference to the purchase of a client’s interest in an
    action. To interpret s. 28 as an antecedent to s. 28.1, wherein agreements must
    be captured by s. 28 to trigger s. 28.1, would render the legislature’s differing
    treatment of the old elements of s. 28 “pointless”, contrary to the principles
    of statutory interpretation. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10><i><span lang=EN-US>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><i><u><span lang=EN-US>Policy concerns </span></u></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept the appellant’s submission that the
    public policy concerns regarding contingency fee agreements in family law
    matters do not apply where the agreement is contingent only on success, and not
    tied to a specific monetary result. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Family law litigation is fundamentally different from civil
    litigation. </span>One of the unique aspects of family law is that monetary recovery
    does not occur in the same way in family law litigation as it does in civil
    litigation. Instead the family finances – which are depleted daily by
    litigation costs – are divided. No outside funds are injected into the recovery.
    In these circumstances, it is inappropriate for a lawyer’s fee to be contingent
    on the monetary result. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also inappropriate for a lawyer’s fees to be contingent on success. In
    family law litigation, the emphasis is “on resolution, mediation and ways to
    save time and expense in proportion to the complexity of the issues”: <span
class=EmphasisStrongChar>Frick v. Frick</span>, 2016 ONCA 799, 132 O.R. (3d)
    321, at para. 11. A fee based on success risks detracting from, and indeed undermining,
    this emphasis.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the primary issue is custody, a fee based in whole or in part on results
    achieved is even less appropriate. <span lang=EN-US>There are no “winners” and
    “losers”. A custody decision by the court involves a determination of a child’s
    best interests. It cannot be scrutinized to determine which parent had the more
    “successful disposition”.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    legislature excluded family law matters from contingency fee agreements on
    public policy grounds under s. 28.1(3)(b) of the <em>Act</em>. There is no reason
    to limit that exclusion to only agreements tied to monetary results. </p>
