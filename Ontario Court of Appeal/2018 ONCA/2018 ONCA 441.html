lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These three appeals have been heard together
    with a view to clarifying the conflicting jurisprudence about the </span><em>mens
    rea</em><span lang=EN-US>, the mental element required to sustain a conviction
    for an offence under s. 149(2) of the </span><em>Workplace Safety and Insurance
    Act,</em> <span lang=EN-US>1997, S.O. 1997, c. 16 Sched. A (“WSIA”). That
    subsection makes it an offence for an injured worker to fail to inform the Workplace
    Safety and Insurance Board (“WSIB” or “Board”) of a material change in
    circumstances in connection with his or her entitlement to benefits.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Statutory Context</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The WSIB is an independent agency established under the
    WSIA. It administers a plan of no-fault insurance for Ontario workplaces. Its
    statutory mandate includes promotion of workplace health and safety, helping
    injured workers return to work, and provision of compensation and other
    benefits for injured workers and workers afflicted with occupational diseases. It
    also provides </span>access to industry specific information about workplace
    fatalities, injuries and illnesses. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both employers and employees can report an
    injury or illness to the WSIB. It then decides whether the injury or illness is
    work-related, gathers relevant information, weighs evidence, and makes a
    decision in respect of a claimant’s entitlement. Although decisions of the WSIB
    are meant to be final, both the employer and employee have a right to appeal a
    decision made in a respect of a claim. Decisions may be appealed to the
    Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal (“WSIAT”) after the WSIB’s
    internal appeal mechanism has been exhausted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A claimant has no right of appeal from a
    decision of the WSIAT. Any further appeal must be made by application for
    judicial review.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 149(2) of the WSIA provides that a
    “person who wilfully fails to inform the Board of a material change of
    circumstances in connection with his or her entitlement to benefits” is guilty
    of an offence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Positions of the parties</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The WSIB takes the position that the </span><em>actus
    reus</em><span lang=EN-US> of the offence is established when an injured worker
    experiences a significant change in his or her health, income or employment
    status and fails to report that change to the Board. It submits that subjective
    awareness and intentional failure to report that there has been such a
    significant change is sufficient to establish the mental element for the
    offence, and that no aspect of the mental element requires any foresight or
    intention in relation to entitlement to benefits. Thus, for example, the Board
    argues that a worker who has suffered a traumatic head injury and is disabled
    by twice weekly migraine headaches would commit an offence if the worker failed
    to report any decrease or even increase in frequency of the headaches to the
    Board, even though that change would not reduce any of the benefits to which
    the worker was entitled. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants, on the other hand, submit that
    the prosecution must prove that the accused knew that a material change in his
    or her circumstances has occurred, intends not to inform the WSIB of the
    change, and foresees that by the failure to inform the WSIB, he or she is
    certain or substantially certain to receive benefits to which he or she is not
    entitled. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h5>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Statutory language</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I begin my analysis with the language of the
    section:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>149(2) A
    person who wilfully fails to inform the Board of a material change in
    circumstances in connection with his or her entitlement to benefits within 10
    days after the change occurs is guilty of an offence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 158 provides that a person who commits
    the offence is liable to a fine up to $25,000 or to imprisonment for up to six
    months, or to both.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The use of the word “wilfully” in the statutory
    text is important and signifies a legislative intention to create a true
    criminal offence “</span><span lang=EN>in which </span><em>mens rea, </em><span
lang=EN>consisting of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or
    recklessness, must be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the
    nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence</span><span lang=EN-US>”: </span><em>R. v. Sault Ste. Marie</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299 at para. 60. The term “wilfully” is a term of
    art usually used to express a </span><em>mens rea</em><span lang=EN-US> requirement that “stresses intention in relation to the achievement of a
    purpose”: </span><em>R. v. Docherty</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 941
    at para. 13.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That interpretation is supported by the use of
    “in connection with his or her entitlement to benefits” to define the scope of
    a “material” change. The use of this phrase suggests a consequence flowing from
    the change, in this context, receipt of benefits under the WSIA to which a
    worker is no longer entitled. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Legislative purpose</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This interpretation is also supported by
    Legislative Debates describing this and other provisions as intended to combat
    fraud, that is to say, workers’ receipt of benefits to which they are not
    entitled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the Bill creating this offence was
    introduced, the Minister of Labour indicated:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span style='color:black;background:white'>[T]his
    board faces fraud and other abuses of the system by employers, by suppliers, by
    workers and by others….The amendments also include measures to stem the loss of
    revenue owed to the WCB, strengthen anti-fraud measures and eliminate abuses of
    the system….The amendments will make it an offence under the act to obtain
    benefits or to receive compensation by deliberately providing false or
    misleading information.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-US>Ontario,
    Legislative Assembly, <i>Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</i>, 36th Parl.,
    1st Sess., (14 November 1995), at 1540 and 1550 (Hon. Elizabeth Witmer).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The amendments were referred to the Standing
    Committee on Resources Development for consideration. In introducing the
    proposed amendments to the Committee, the Honourable John R. Baird, standing-in
    for the Minister of Labour, discussed the new offences and penalties section.
    He referred specifically to the new provisions which placed “positive
    obligations on workers and employers to report to the board when there are
    changes in circumstances that, in the case of workers, affect their rights to
    benefits”. He described the Bill as “the tools [that the Board] needs to go
    after all forms of fraud.” He referred to failing to report a change in
    circumstance as “stealing money from the WCB.” The amendments proceeded
    unchanged to third reading and the Bill received Royal Assent on December 14,
    1995: see Ontario, Legislative Assembly, </span><em>Standing Committee of
    Resources Development, Consideration of Bill 15</em><span lang=EN-US>, 36th
    Parl., 1st Sess., (27 November 1995 and 11 December 1995) (Mr. John R. Baird).</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Factual context</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Injured workers are a vulnerable group. Some,
    like Mr. Kathirkamapillai, may suffer traumatic stress injuries and lasting
    mental illness such as depression. Others, like Mr. Koomson, may suffer
    traumatic head injuries which leave them with permanent cognitive impairment. Others,
    like Mr. Curtis, may suffer bodily injury that results in chronic pain and
    reduced mobility. Understanding whether a change in symptoms is or is not
    material in relation to entitlement to benefits may require medical expertise,
    and an understanding of the basis upon which benefits have been provided which
    is not always apparent to an injured worker. Some injured workers may have
    language difficulties. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this context, where the offence is committed
    as a result of a failure to act, conviction should not follow unless the Crown
    proves either that the worker failed to report a material change with the
    intention that he or she receive benefits to which he or she is not entitled, or
    subjectively knew that such a result is substantially certain to follow. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am not convinced by the WSIB argument that a
    minimal </span><em>mens rea</em><span lang=EN-US> requirement is necessary to
    advance the objectives of the legislative regime. The WSIB has all the powers
    necessary to declare that overpayments have been made and to recover benefit-related
    debt resulting from a failure to report a material change in circumstance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This offence is analogous to the offence of tax
    evasion, described in </span><em>R. v. Klundert </em><span lang=EN-US>(2004), </span>242
    D.L.R. (4th) 644 (C.A.)<span lang=EN-US>. As here, tax evasion is defined as a
    wilful act; the wilful evasion of the payment of taxes imposed by the </span><em>Income
    Tax</em> <em>Act, </em>R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)<span lang=EN-US> and akin
    to fraud. As here, the statutory regime calls for self-reporting of income so
    that tax liability can be established. As here, the regime is “necessarily and
    notoriously complex” where no lay person could be “expected to know all of the
    complexities of the tax laws”: </span><em>Klundert, </em><span lang=EN-US>at
    para. 55. A search of Canlii shows that the WSIAT rendered some 75,486
    decisions between January 1, 1986 and April 13, 2018. As here, tax evasion may
    be committed by a failure to act (a failure to report income) and there is a
    statutory regime for the recovery of money which should have been paid. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under similar circumstances, Doherty J.A.
    concluded at para. 47 of </span><em>Klundert, </em><span lang=EN-US>that proof
    of tax evasion required proof that an accused:</span></p>

    combination of both.&nbsp;The guilty knowledge necessary to sustain a
    conviction will be imputed to an accused who is wilfully blind, that is to say,
    knows that there had been a material change likely to affect his or her entitlement
    to benefits but deliberately chooses not to make the inquiries which would fix
    him or her with knowledge, so that he or she can deny knowledge: <em>R. v.

    constant supervision by a caregiver. It paid the appellant a personal care allowance
    for this purpose. The reason the WSIB paid these benefits to the appellant was
    because of its belief that he lacked the capacity to respond independently to
    an emergency situation. However, it believed the appellant required no
    assistance in other aspects of daily living such as bathing, exercising,
