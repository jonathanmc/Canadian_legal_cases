  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Justin Reid, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard: May 8, 2018</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Irving
    W. André of the Superior Court of Justice on July 25, 2016, and from the
    sentence imposed on November 15, 2016.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>By the Court:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial before André J. of the Superior Court of Justice, the
    appellant was convicted of sexual interference and attempt to obstruct justice.
    He received a sentence of 27 months’ imprisonment less nine months and 24 days
    for pre-sentence custody. The trial judge imposed several ancillary orders on
    sentence, including a <em>Sex Offender Information Registration Act</em>, S.C.
    2004, c. 10 (“SOIRA”) order under s. 490.012 of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> for life.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the appeal hearing, the appellant, with the assistance of duty
    counsel from the Pro Bono Inmate Appeal Program, abandoned his conviction
    appeal. On his sentence appeal, he challenged only the lifetime SOIRA order.
    His position is that the SOIRA order should have a duration of 20 years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent agrees with the appellant’s position on this issue. Both
    trial counsel indicated that a SOIRA order of 20 years was appropriate. In
    spite of this, the trial judge imposed a SOIRA order with a lifetime duration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SOIRA order in this case was imposed under s. 490.012(1) of the <em>Code</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>When a court imposes a sentence on a person for an offence
    referred to in paragraph (<em>a</em>), (<em>c</em>), (<em>c</em>.1), (<em>d</em>),
    (<em>d</em>.1), or (<em>e</em>) of the definition “designated offence” in
    subsection 490.011(1) … , it shall make an order in Form 52 requiring the
    person to comply with the <em>Sex Offender Information Registration Act</em> for the applicable period specified in section 490.013.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 490.013(2) of the <em>Code</em> deals with the duration of SOIRA
    orders:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>An order made under subsection 490.012(1) or (2)</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) ends 10 years after it was made if the offence in
    connection with which it was made was prosecuted summarily or if the maximum
    term of imprisonment for the offence is two to five years;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) ends 20 years after it was made if the maximum term of
    imprisonment for the offence is 10 or 14 years;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) applies for life if the maximum term of imprisonment for
    the offence is life.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sexual interference is a “designated offence” with a maximum sentence of
    14 years if the charge was laid in an indictment. Hence the SOIRA order in this
    case should have had a duration of 20 years, not life.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In spite of the shared agreement between the appellant and respondent on
    this issue, the respondent raises a problem about how to fix it. The respondent
    says that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal relating to the
    SOIRA order. That is because there is no longer a right to appeal a SOIRA order
    imposed under s. 490.012(1) of the <em>Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This problem was first identified by Drapeau C.J.N.B. in <em>R. v.
    Chisholm</em>, 2012 NBCA 79, at para. 2:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I reluctantly conclude there is no right of appeal, with or
    without leave, from [SOIRA] orders. It follows that the underlying appeal
    proceedings were initiated without lawful authority. In my view, the
    appropriate remedy is to quash the Notice of Appeal….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, Drapeau C.J.N.B. considered whether a SOIRA
    order could be considered part of the “sentence” imposed by a trial court and, therefore,
    amenable to appeal under relevant sentence appeal provisions in the <em>Code</em>.
    His conclusion, at para. 10, was that “a <em>SOIRA</em> order issued by virtue
    of s. 490.012(1) is not a “sentence” within the meaning of Part XXI (“APPEALS –
    INDICTABLE OFFENCES”).” In support of this conclusion, Drapeau C.J.N.B. set
    out, at paras.11-20, ten factors, considerations and interpretations relating
    to the history and wording of the key SOIRA provisions. We do not repeat all of
    these factors in these reasons, but highlight the following as particularly
    persuasive:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Parliament eliminated the broad right of appeal from SOIRA orders
    in s. 490.014 of the <em>Code</em>;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The weight of authority prior to the amendments that eliminated
    the broad right of appeal was that a SOIRA order is not a sentence;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>SOIRA orders do not fall within the definition of “sentence” in
    s. 673 of the <em>Code</em>; and </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>DNA orders are procedurally similar to SOIRA orders; courts have
    consistently held that DNA orders do not form part of a sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    several provincial appeal and trial courts have adopted the analysis and
    conclusion in <em>Chisholm</em>: see, for example, <em>R. v. J.J.W.</em>, 2012
    NSCA 96; <em>R. v. Whiting</em>, 2013 SKCA 127; <em>R. v. Boucher</em>, 2013
    QCCA 345; <em>R. v. L.V.R.</em>, 2016 BCCA 86; <em>R. v. Alvarenga-Alas</em>,
    2014 ONSC 4725; <em>R. v. Colosie</em>, 2016 ONSC 1708; <em>R. v. Krause</em>,
    2015 ABQB 637; and <em>R. v. R.M.</em>, 2015 NLTD(G) 101.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two cases, both from this court, which might suggest a different result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. A.C.</em>, 2012 ONCA 608, the Attorney General sought an increase in
    the duration of a SOIRA order from ten to 20 years. The request was unopposed. It
    appears that no one raised the issue of jurisdiction. In granting the request,
    the court said, at para. 10:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In our view, in the circumstances of this case, the sentence
    imposed reflects no error in principle except that, as the parties agree, the
    period of the SOIRA order should be increased to 20 years to accord with s.
    490.013(2)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in <em>R. v. Dimmick</em>, 2015 ONCA 402, Mr. Dimmick sought a reduction of a
    lifetime SOIRA order to 20 years. The Crown agreed. Again, it appears that no
    one raised the issue of jurisdiction. In reducing the order, the court said, at
    para. 11:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In addition to the seven year sentence, the trial judge imposed
    a lifetime SOIRA order. The maximum terms for the offences were 10 and 14
    years. The respondent Crown agrees with the appellant that the trial judge
    erred in this regard and that the order should be reduced to 20 years and we so
    order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the jurisdictional issue was not raised or addressed in <em>A.C.</em> and <em>Dimmick</em>,
    we do not think they preclude this court from adopting <em>Chisholm</em> and
    its national progeny. This court can do so now that the issue has been properly
    advanced and argued.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn to the final issue. In <em>Chisholm</em>, the court quashed the Crown
    appeal for want of jurisdiction. The result was that a SOIRA order with an
    erroneous duration of 20 years continued in force instead of the lifetime order
    that should have been imposed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this appeal, the fact situation is the other way. A convicted person seeks to
    reduce an erroneous lifetime SOIRA order to an order with a correct duration of
    20 years. Obviously, his position is an attractive one. If we must quash the
    appeal, is there any other way for the appellant to obtain the just remedy he
    seeks?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    answer is ‘Yes’, as demonstrated convincingly in the excellent judgment by
    Goldstein J. of the Superior Court of Justice in <em>Alvarenga-Alas</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Alvarenga-Alas</em>, a trial judge convicted Mr. Alvarenga-Alas of two
    counts of sexual assault. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown, without
    opposition from the defence, erroneously indicated that Mr. Alvarenga-Alas
    should be placed on the sex offender registry for ten years. The trial judge imposed
    a ten year SOIRA order. However, the order should have been for life. The Crown
    brought the error to the trial judge’s attention and asked her to correct it.
    She declined, saying she was <em>functus officio</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown brought an application for the prerogative writ of <em>mandamus</em>,
    arguing that the trial judge should have exercised her jurisdiction and
    corrected her original order. Goldstein J. determined that the trial judge was
    not <em>functus</em> and made the <em>mandamus</em> order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basis for the <em>mandamus</em> order, according to Goldstein J., was that the
    trial judge had an inherent jurisdiction to correct the erroneous SOIRA order.
    In reaching this conclusion, Goldstein J. carefully considered and applied –
    correctly in our view – <em>R. v. Burke</em>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 857, and <em>R.
    v. Malicia</em> (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 772 (C.A.). Citing <em>R. v. D.M.</em>,
    2013 ONSC 141, Goldstein J. relied on four factors that supported his
    conclusion that the trial judge had an inherent jurisdiction to correct an
    erroneous SOIRA order: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The correction or amendment is more clerical or administrative in
    nature since the error relates to a statutorily mandated ancillary order with a
    fixed duration, one for which there is no residual discretion lying with the
    court (paras. 55-58);</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed, the making of a SOIRA order does not require a judge to
    make any substantive decision - there is no judgment or discretion involved;
    nor is there any consideration of law or evidence (paras. 61-63);</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No prejudice flows from the correction or amendment of the order
    since all it would do is bring it into conformity with legal requirements
    (para. 57); and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It would always be a judge’s manifest intention to make a SOIRA
    order compliant with the correct mandatory duration for such orders set out in
    s. 490.013 of the <em>Code</em> (paras. 57 and 68).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, and under the jurisprudential umbrella of <em>Burke</em> and <em>Malicia</em>,
    we conclude that, although there is no right to appeal a SOIRA order imposed
    pursuant to s. 490.012(1) of the <em>Code</em>, such an order may be corrected
    by the judge who imposed it who, in these particular circumstances, retains
    inherent jurisdiction to do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is quashed for want of jurisdiction. The appellant, perhaps with the
    assistance of duty counsel, may return the matter to the trial judge for
    correction of the erroneous SOIRA order.</p>
