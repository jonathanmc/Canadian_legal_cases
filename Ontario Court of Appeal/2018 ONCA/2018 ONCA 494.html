  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on June 14, 2013 and
    the sentence imposed on January 10, 2014 by Justice Thomas A. Bielby of the Superior
    Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Sharpe J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, a tax return preparer, was
    charged on a one count indictment with fraud over $5,000 for filing false
    claims of charitable donations on behalf of his clients. The appellant did not
    dispute that he had filed hundreds of claims for charitable deductions for
    donations of used goods to a registered charity called Tractors for Daily Bread
    (“Tractors”) and that he had been paid by his clients a percentage of the
    amounts claimed, usually between 10 and 15%. He testified, however, that he
    believed that the claims were valid and that they had been verified by
    Tractors. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After a twelve day jury trial, the appellant was
    convicted and sentenced to 30 months in custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in admitting the non-expert opinion evidence of a Canada Customs and Revenue
    Agency (“C.C.R.A.”) investigator, and further erred in his instruction to the
    jury on the <em>mens rea</em> component of fraud and the use that could be made
    of prior inconsistent statements. The appellant also seeks leave to appeal his
    sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2002, the appellant, at the time a recent
    immigrant from Nigeria, took an eight week tax preparation course and started
    his own tax preparation business. He met Mr. Eto Eto, the executive director of
    Tractors. Tractors’ stated purpose was to collect donations in cash and in used
    goods to alleviate poverty in Africa. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Eto referred tax clients to the appellant and
    allowed the appellant to carry on his tax preparation business at Tractors’
    office. The appellant also met clients at coffee shops and in his car to
    prepare their tax returns. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant carried on his tax preparation
    business for the taxation years 2003, 2004 and 2005 in the name of Datronix
    Solutions, an unincorporated entity. In 2006, he involved Ayodeji Salami in his
    tax preparation business. Salami obtained his own Efiler number but acted under
    the appellant’s instructions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown called eleven of the appellant’s
    clients, and one client of Salami’s, as witnesses. They testified that the
    appellant suggested that they could reduce their income tax by making donations
    in cash and in kind to Tractors. The appellant asked them to pay him 10 to 15%
    of the amount of the donation to be claimed and also charged them a fee for
    preparing their return. Over the three year period between 2003 and 2005, the
    appellant submitted 27 tax returns on behalf of those clients claiming a total
    of $223,793 in charitable donations resulting in tax refunds of $58,138. The 10
    to 15% fee charged by the appellant was typically paid from the proceeds of the
    clients’ tax refund as the appellant would hold their cheques until they
    received their refunds. The clients testified that they did not think that they
    were doing anything illegal, but eleven of them admitted that they had made no
    donations in kind to Tractors. The evidence of the twelfth client was very
    vague about what he had donated. All of these witnesses testified that they had
    been reassessed and had to re-pay the C.C.R.A. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown also called Seeta Maraj, a C.C.R.A.
    investigator. Maraj prepared a number of detailed spread-sheets summarizing
    information obtained from documents filed with the C.C.R.A., bank documents
    obtained pursuant to a production order and documents seized pursuant to search
    warrants executed at the Tractors premises and the residences of the appellant,
    Eto and Salami. The appellant’s clients’ tax returns were found on his
    computer. The charitable receipts issued by Tractors were found on Eto’s
    computer. The appellant made no objection when the spreadsheets and other
    documents were introduced in evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While Maraj’s evidence was lengthy and the
    supporting documents were voluminous, the totality of that evidence may be
    summarized as follows. The spreadsheets itemized, name by name, the claims for
    charitable donations made in income tax returns filed by the appellant on
    behalf of clients for the taxation years 2003, 2004 and 2005, and by Salami for
    the taxation year 2005. A significant number of returns claim large amounts for
    charitable donations, averaging 20 to 30% of each client’s reported income.
    C.C.R.A. records indicated that the total amount of charitable donations
    claimed by the appellant’s clients was $842,593 in 2003, $1,801,123 in 2004, and
    $1,830,712 in 2005. Salami’s clients claimed $549,028 in 2005. The refunds paid
    on account of those claims were for approximately $1,400,000. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A spreadsheet found in Eto’s residence listed
    $766,030 in charitable donations for the appellant’s clients in 2003.
    Spreadsheets for the years 2004 and 2005 linked the claimed donations by each
    client with the cancelled cheques the appellant had received for making
    charitable claims. The total amount of charitable receipts claimed was
    $1,137,255 for 2004, and $1,226,766 for the appellant and $421,436 for Salami
    for 2005. The spreadsheets showed donation receipts for the appellant’s clients
    found on the Tractors computer, indicating claims for donations of $951,050 in
    2004 and $998,910 in 2005. One of the documents seized was an email from the
    appellant to Eto providing a four page list giving the names of clients and the
    amounts they had claimed for charitable donations to Tractors for the year
    2005. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By contrast, Tractors reported receiving gifts
    in the amounts of $700 for 2003, zero in 2004 and $200 in 2005.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown also called Salami who testified that
    he assisted the appellant in his tax preparation business for the 2005 taxation
    year. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified in his own defence. He
    swore that he did not know that the charitable claims he filed on behalf of his
    clients were false. He relied on Eto to verify the claims, to have the donated
    goods appraised and to ensure that proper charitable receipts were filed. He
    testified that he was shocked when the C.C.R.A. investigated his clients and
    only realized that the charitable donation claims were false when he saw that
    Tractors had reported little or no charitable donations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant conceded that he had received
    payments for 10 to 15% of the charitable donations claimed and that he had not
    reported those payments on his tax returns. The appellant testified that he had
    often held his clients’ cheques and only cashed them after the refund was paid.
    He denied that the payments he received from clients were for fraudulent
    charitable receipts and asserted that they were by way of commission for
    soliciting charitable donations.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Opinion evidence</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    by admitting what amounted to opinion evidence from Seeta Maraj, the C.C.R.A.
    investigator, who was not qualified as an expert. This argument focusses on the
    evidence relating to Exhibit 12, a spreadsheet headed “Tax Evaded Calculation –
    Ajise (Efiler D6458&amp; E0300 &amp; Salami (Efiler D5913)” that gives totals
    for “false donation claims” in returns filed by the appellant for 2003, 2004
    and 2005, and Salami for 2005. Exhibit 12 was filed towards the end of Maraj’s
    evidence in chief. The appellant’s trial counsel did not object to its
    admissibility. Exhibit 12 identified “false donation” claims totalling $842,
    593 in 2003, $1,801,123 in 2004 and $2,379,740 ($1,830,712 by the appellant and
    $549,028 by Salami) in 2005. Exhibit 12 also stated that $241,678 in tax was
    “evaded” in 2003, $493,445 in 2004 and $678,043 ($521,335 for the appellant and
    $156,708 for Salami) in 2005. These figures were derived from what the C.C.R.A.
    files showed had been claimed by way of charitable donations on the returns
    filed by the appellant and Salami</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Maraj was asked to explain “how you know those
    donations were false”. She explained she had compared the amounts shown by the
    C.C.R.A. records with the amounts shown on the spreadsheets she had prepared
    based on what was found on Eto’s computer and based on the cancelled cheques the
    appellant had received. These spreadsheets set out, client by client, the
    charitable claims the clients had made for donations to Tractors. The total
    amounts from those lists were somewhat less than shown on Exhibit 12: for 2003,
    $766,030 rather than $842,593; for 2004, $1,137,255 rather than $1,801,123; and
    for 2005, $1,226,766 rather than $1,830,712. She explained that while she had
    tracked cancelled cheques, some of the payments to the appellant could have
    been in cash. She testified that the amounts were close enough to lead her “to
    believe that all of the donation claims were false”. The appellant submits that
    this amounted to opinion evidence that should not have been admitted as Maraj
    was not qualified as an expert.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also takes issue with Maraj’s
    evidence that she believed that one of the lists found on Eto’s computer had
    been prepared by the appellant. When asked why she thought that, Maraj
    explained that the list had personal information about the clients as well as
    filing information that would not have been available to Eto. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>No objection was made to any of this evidence
    and the appellant’s trial counsel began her cross-examination of Maraj by
    asking: “You indicated to us today that your belief that the receipts were
    false were, in effect, based on a couple of different things. Is that right?”
    Maraj replied that her belief was based on two facts. First, that Tractors’
    charity returns reported little or no charitable donations. Second, that while
    there were discrepancies between the amounts shown on Exhibit 12 and the
    amounts derived from the spreadsheets she prepared, the differences were not sufficiently
    large to give rise to concern. The appellant’s trial counsel probed Maraj on
    the significance of the discrepancies but Maraj maintained her position that
    all the claims for charitable donations filed by the appellant were false. </span></p>

    invited the jury in her closing address to rely on Maraj’s “</span><em>findings </em><span lang=EN-US>of false charitable donation claims” (emphasis added).
    The prejudice to the appellant was compounded when the trial judge in his
    instructions to the jury referenced Maraj’s testimony that the returns filed by
    the appellant “contained false donation claims in her <em>opinion</em>” (emphasis
    added). Further exception is taken to the instruction reminding the jury of
    Maraj’s “belief” that [the appellant] prepared one of the lists of the
    donations found on Eto’s computer, and that “[the] minimal or nil donations
    reported by Tractors confirmed for Ms. Maraj her </span><em>conclusions</em><span

lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown argues that Maraj’s evidence was
    factual in nature and that there was no need to qualify her as an expert. The

    evidence impugned on appeal, the argument that it should be ruled inadmissible
    on appeal should not be entertained. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am not persuaded that the admission or
    treatment of Maraj’s evidence at trial amounts to a reversible error for the
    following reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>First, Maraj is properly characterized by the Crown as a fact
    witness, called to explain how she had assembled and summarized a large volume
    of documentary evidence relating to the income tax returns filed by the
    appellant. It was only at the end of her evidence in chief, when Exhibit 12 was
    introduced, that she was asked to explain why she believed all the charitable
    claims filed by the appellant’s clients were false. When asked that question,
    she simply explained what the records showed. Maraj was doing nothing more than
    explaining her sources and her methodology in a way that would allow the jury to
    understand and to assess the numbers on Exhibit 12. The lists from Eto’s
    computer, the list on the appellant’s computer, and the compilation derived
    from the cancelled cheques demonstrated that a very large number of the
    appellant’s clients had submitted substantial claims for charitable donations
    to Tractors representing a disproportionate part of their income. The records
    showed that the appellant had been directly paid 10 to 15% of the amounts
    claimed by way of donation and that Tractors had reported receipt of virtually
    no charitable donations. While the total of the itemized, client by client
    lists of Tractors donations was less than the total showed by C.C.R.A. records
    for all returns filed by the appellant, Maraj testified that they were close
    enough to lead her to believe that all the charitable claims the appellant filed
    were false, which is why she included them in the “false donation” column on
    Exhibit 12. While it might have been preferable had Maraj not been asked to
    formulate her summary of the evidence she found in terms of her belief, and had
    the trial judge not referred to her opinion in his instructions, it remains
    that Maraj’s evidence was essentially factual in nature. It was entirely proper
    for her to explain to the jury the nature of the calculations she had made and
    the source data she used to compile Exhibit 12, which was an admissible </span>demonstrative
    aid designed to summarize the properly admitted evidence and “to assist the
    jury in understanding the entire picture presented by voluminous documentary
    evidence”: <em>R v. Scheel </em>(1979), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 31, at p. 34 (Ont.
    C.A.); <em>Kon Construction Ltd. v. Terranova Developments Ltd.</em>, 2015 ABCA
    249, 20 Alta L.R. (6th) 85, at para. 46. As with the summaries in <em>Scheel</em>,
    the usefulness of Exhibit 12 “depended entirely…upon the acceptance by the jury
    of the proof of the facts upon which [it was] based”: <em>Scheel</em>, at p. 34
    . The jury was in a position to assess for itself the worth of Maraj’s
    explanation for her calculations as they did not rest on or draw its force from
    any specialized or technical skill or knowledge: see <em>R. v. Hamilton</em>,
    2011 ONCA 399, 271 C.C.C. (3d) 208, at para. 277.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Maraj explained how she had compiled the
    spreadsheets and what her background sources were. Maraj’s calculations were
    explained and her reasons for labelling the donations “false” were fully
    explored by defence counsel and exposed in a way that could be assessed by the
    jury as a matter of logic and common sense. Even if not every dollar of the
    $5,023,456 shown on Exhibit 12 was nailed down as being a Tractors’ donation,
    it was open to a trier of fact to infer that false claims comprised a
    significant portion of that total. The background sources were available for
    the jury’s consideration. In her closing address, Crown counsel encouraged the
    jury to consider those sources. The trial judge also referred to the background
    sources in reviewing the evidence during his charge to the jury. The jury was
    also instructed that they could accept all, some or none of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Maraj’s statement that she believed that the
    appellant was the source of one of the lists found on Eto’s computer has to be
    read in context. The evidence showed that the appellant had sent lists to Eto
    and, as Maraj explained, the list at issue contained information to which the
    appellant was privy and Eto was not. The question was one of fact upon which a
    non-expert witness could properly express a view: see <em>R. v. Graat,</em> </span>[1982]
    2 S.C.R. 819, at pp. 835-839.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant did not object to this
    evidence at trial. The Crown suggests that this could have been a tactical
    decision as the alternative might have been to face the direct evidence of more
    of the appellant’s clients. Related to the failure to object is the manner in
    which the appellant’s trial counsel cross-examined Maraj, effectively accepting
    and joining issue with the manner in which Maraj’s evidence had been led. The
    appellant’s trial counsel was content to allow Maraj to testify as to her
    belief and then to challenge that belief on cross-examination. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The lack of objection, the way Maraj was
    cross-examined and the use of Maraj’s evidence during closing submissions suggests
    that Maraj’s evidence was not impermissible opinion evidence prejudicial to the
    position of the appellant: </span><em>R. v. Daley, </em><span lang=EN-US>2007
    SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 53, at para. 58; </span><em>R. v. Potts</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The third and related reason that leads me to
    reject this argument is how Maraj’s evidence relates to the substance of the
    defence advanced by the appellant. The appellant did not seriously challenge
    the contention that his clients had made false charitable donations. His
    defence was that he believed that the donations were valid and that he had
    relied on Eto to verify the donations before authorizing charitable receipts.
    Maraj’s evidence went to the <em>actus reus</em> of the fraud – whether false
    claims were made and in what amount. The appellant’s defence was that he did
    not know that the claims were false and that he lacked the <em>mens rea</em> to
    commit fraud. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Indeed, defence counsel’s closing address
    demonstrates that the appellant may well have wanted Maraj’s evidence admitted.
    He relied upon this evidence to advance the proposition that he was an
    unwitting dupe in a fraudulent scheme. As defence counsel submitted in her closing
    submissions, if he had known about the fraud, he would have taken some steps to
    cover his tracks. According to counsel, the “obvious” nature of the fraud
    demonstrated that the appellant did not know he was unwittingly involved in a
    fraudulent scheme: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>And David Ajise, this really smart guy, this mastermind behind this
    scheme risks all of the things I’ve just mentioned to you, to engage in a
    fraudulent scheme and then he makes sure to make it as obvious as possible.
    Let’s just make it as obvious as possible and leave a clear paper trail leading
    to me. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>You’ve heard the evidence … when he’s submitting these – these tax
    returns on behalf of clients, he’s using his own Efile in each of the years, to
    ensure that the Canada Revenue Agency can trace back each of these returns to
    him. Let – let’s just engage in a fraudulent scheme, let’s plan it, let’s
    intend it, but then make it as obvious as possible, so the CRA can trace it all
    back to me. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>… </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>If this was not a legitimate scheme, I put to you again that Mr.
    Ajise would have warned people or signaled to people that this was not
    legitimate … there’s other ways of filing. … Why make it so obvious? It just
    doesn’t make any sense.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>… </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Why send these
    spreadsheets to Mr. Eto Eto …? Well the point of the spreadsheets is because
    Mr. David Ajise genuinely believed that Mr. Eto was following on the donations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The nature of the appellant’s defence
    distinguishes this case from the cases relied upon by the appellant; <em>R. v.
    Sekhon</em>, 2014 SCC 15, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 272 and <em>R. v. Lewis</em>, 2012
    ONCA 388, 284 C.C.C. (3d) 423. <em>Sekhon</em> was a drug importation case. The
    accused denied knowledge that the truck he was driving had a concealed
    compartment containing cocaine. The Supreme Court held that the trial judge
    erred by admitting the evidence of a police officer, who had been qualified as
    an expert, that he had never encountered a blind courier. The Court held that
    this was purely anecdotal evidence that lacked relevance and probative value
    and that did not qualify as expert evidence. <em>Lewis</em> was also a drug
    importation case where the accused denied knowledge of the drugs. A Border
    Services Inspector who had not been qualified as an expert testified that short
    notice ticketing and cash payment were strong indicators of a drug courier. This
    court held that there was danger that the jury would clothe the Inspector’s
    evidence with an aura of authority that it did not deserve. In both cases, the
    impugned evidence went to the heart of the accused’s defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-US>Sekhon</span></em><span lang=EN-US> and <em>Lewis</em> both involved challenges to the evidence of inspectors and police officers
    testifying, in effect, that the accused is guilty and clothing that opinion
    with an aura of expertise. In both cases, the key issue was whether the accused
    knew that he was carrying drugs and in both cases, the impugned evidence denied
    the validity of that defence. Maraj’s evidence does not fall into that
    forbidden category. Her evidence was limited to the issue of whether false
    donation claims had been filed and, as I have found, she was entitled to give
    that evidence. She said nothing about the appellant’s defence of lack of
    knowledge that the claims were false and the risk posed by the improper
    evidence in <em>Sekhon</em> and <em>Lewis</em> was not present in this case.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>Finally, I note
    that in her dissenting reasons, my colleague Pardu J.A. places considerable
    emphasis on the suggestion that to succeed on this ground, the respondent must
    rely on the </span></em>curative proviso<em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:
normal'> but is precluded from doing so as that argument was not explicitly
    made in either oral or written submissions. I agree that no explicit reference
    was made to s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the </span></em><em><span lang=EN-US>Criminal
    Code</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>. However, even
    assuming that resort to the proviso is required in this case, it is my view
    that the substance of the proviso point was raised. In her submissions before
    this court, Crown counsel placed considerable reliance upon the argument that the
    defence effectively conceded at trial that the donation claims were fraudulent
    and instead relied entirely on the appellant’s claim that he lacked knowledge
    of the fraud. On this basis, the Crown argued that even if the impugned
    evidence amounted to opinion evidence, it did not go to the only live issue at
    trial. The Crown also noted that Maraj’s impugned statements comprised a small
    portion of the evidence advanced during a multi-day trial, and were admitted
    without objection by defence counsel. In my view, these lines of argument
    amounted in substance to a submission that even if there was an error in
    admitting the evidence or in failing to conduct a </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-US>voir dire</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>,
    no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred and the appeal
    should be dismissed on that account. As the substance of that point was
    addressed and fully argued before this court, the failure to specifically
    reference s. 686(1)(b)(iii) should not be fatal. </span></em></p>

    question stating that as the appellant “put so much trust in Mr. Eto” they
    would like to have the last fifteen minutes of the appellant’s
    cross-examination played back. That request was granted. The portion of the
    cross-examination focused on how the fees were collected, recorded and divided
    with Eto and another individual, the due diligence required of a tax filer, and
    how the appellant had relied upon Eto to have donated goods appraised and
    proper receipts issued. The jury’s question, according to the appellant, proved
    that they had been misled by the jury instructions as to the </span><em>mens

    derived from the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em>R. v. Théroux</em>,
    [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5. The Crown further submits that when the instruction is read
    as a whole, it would have been clear to the jury that in order to convict the
    appellant, they had to be satisfied that he knew that the tax returns were
    false. </span></p>

    source for the impugned passage, involved a developer who assured purchasers
    that their deposits were insured. This claim was false, the developer’s company
    went bankrupt, residences were not built, and there was no insurance to protect
    the purchasers who lost their deposits. The appellant was charged with fraud. McLachlin
    J. posed the issue to be resolved as follows, at p. 14:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is no doubt that the appellant deliberately practised a
    deceitful act, constituting the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence of
    fraud.&nbsp; The issue is whether the fact that he honestly believed that the
    projects would be completed negates the guilty mind or <em>mens rea</em> of the
    offence.&nbsp; This requires this Court to examine the question of what
    constitutes the <em>mens rea</em> for the offence of fraud.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At p. 19, McLachlin J. applied to fraud the
    “traditional criminal law principle that the mental state necessary to the
    offence must be determined by reference to the external acts which constitute
    the <em>actus</em> of the offence…” This means that “the fact that the accused
    may have hoped the deprivation would not take place, or may have felt that
    there was nothing wrong with what he or she was doing, provides no defence”.
    Once the <em>actus reus</em> is made out, <em>Théroux</em> holds that “it need
    only be determined that an accused knowingly undertook the acts in question,
    aware that deprivation, or risk of deprivation, could follow as a likely
    consequence”: see pp. 19-20. </span></p>

    appeal for the simple reason that neither of the two Crown witnesses identified
    by the appellant adopted their prior inconsistent statements as true. Monique
    Robinson, one of the appellant’s former clients, had told investigators that
    goods were donated to Tractors, but testified at trial that she was mistaken as
    her husband had explained that the goods were given to a friend. Clive Williams,
    another former client of the appellant’s, told the investigator that he had
    donated old furniture to Tractors and while attempt was made to have him adopt
    that statement on cross examination, he did not do so.</span></p>

    the appellant to 30 months in custody. He noted that the appellant has a family
    of three children, many positive references from his friends, church and
    community and that the appellant would face deportation without a right of
    appeal if sentenced to six months imprisonment or more. The appellant had a
    prior and dated conviction for fraud but had received a pardon for that
    offence. The trial judge reviewed the case law and determined that a sentence
    of 30 months custody was appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sole ground for the sentence appeal is that
    even if the conviction is upheld on the basis of the evidence of the
    appellant’s clients, it is still open to this Court to find that the trial
    judge erred in relying on Maraj’s evidence to conclude that the amount involved
    in the fraud was in the $1 million range. The sentence should therefore be
    reduced to 6 months less a day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was only at the sentencing stage that the
    appellant raised any issue as to the fact that Maraj had not been qualified as
    an expert. The trial judge dismissed that objection, holding that it was not
    necessary to qualify her as an expert as she had simply “[re]ported on her
    findings and her evidence as to the total amounts in issue was not seriously
    challenged.” The trial judge added that there was no need to call all of the appellant’s
    clients who had claimed false donations, since “[a] sampling was sufficient to
    prove the fraud” and he was satisfied that it had a value of over $1 million.</span></p>

    already been said in relation to the conviction appeal as to the magnitude of
    this fraud. Simply put, I am satisfied that the trial judge did not err in
    finding that when the <em>viva voce</em> evidence of the appellant’s clients is
    considered together with the documentary evidence, the Crown did prove fraud in
    the range of $1 million. Even if one were to reject the Crown’s contention that <em>all </em>of the charitable donations claimed in returns filed by the
    appellant were false donations, the Crown established that the appellant
    submitted a very large volume of claims for charitable donations to Tractors on
    behalf of his clients and that the appellant had been paid 10 to 15% for each
    of those claimed donations. </span></p>

    charitable donations were not in fact made to Tractors, and did not know that

    establishing the value of goods donated to Tractors.</span></p>

    the taxpayers had really donated money or goods to Tractors. She began her
    evidence by explaining charts that organized data she had retrieved from the
    tax returns prepared by the appellant, Tractors donation records, bank records
    of the appellant, and computer records. I agree that this was factual
    information not requiring a </span><em>voir dire</em><span lang=EN-US>. Partway
    through her examination in chief, however, rather than eliciting the factual
    information collected, the Crown began to ask leading questions as to the
    nature of the donations:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>First of all I
    just want to be clear, the – the amounts of –  in total false donations
    claimed, as well as the total tax evaded due to false donations that you just

    answers that followed. In her examination in chief, Maraj went on to testify
    how she came to her opinion that the donations were false. She had interviewed
    several taxpayers who told her that they had not dealt with Tractors
    themselves. In cross examination, she explained that although there were some
    discrepancies between the donation amounts claimed and the amounts indicated on
    the spreadsheets she prepared as part of her investigation, the differences
    were not sufficiently large to give rise to concern. Maraj’s estimation of the
    total donation amounts claimed was off by roughly $600,000 but Maraj testified
    she could still conclude that the charitable donation claims were false, particularly
    given that the donations claimed were large in relation to the taxpayers
    reported net income for 2004, for example.</span></p>

    opinion evidence of non-expert witnesses, or lay opinion evidence, is generally
    inadmissible. In <em>R. v. D. (D.)</em>, 2000 SCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275, at
    para. 49, the Supreme Court of Canada summarized this long-standing
    exclusionary rule:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A basic tenet of our law is that
    the usual witness may not give opinion evidence, but testify only to facts
    within his knowledge, observation and experience. This is a commendable
    principle since it is the task of the fact finder, whether a jury or judge
    alone, to decide what secondary inferences are to be drawn from the facts
    proved.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the history of the lay opinion evidence rule has been fraught with ambiguities,
    in Alan W. Bryant, Sidney N. Lederman &amp; Michelle K. Fuerst’s, <em>The Law
    of Evidence in Canada</em>, 5th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2018), at p. 820, its
    receivability is described in these terms:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Courts now have greater freedom to
    receive lay witnesses’ opinions if: (1) the witness <span class=Underline>has
    personal knowledge of the observed facts</span>; (2) the witness is in a better
    position than the trier of fact to draw the inference; (3) the witness has the
    necessary experiential capacity to draw the inference, that is, form the
    opinion; and (4) the opinion is a compendious mode of speaking and the witness
    could not as accurately, adequately and with reasonable facility describe the
    facts she or he is testifying about. But as such evidence approaches the
    central issues that the courts must decide, one can still expect an insistence
    that the witnesses stick to the primary facts and refrain from giving their
    inferences. It is always a matter of degree. As the testimony shades towards a
    legal conclusion, resistance to admissibility develops. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    tenuous, </span>in <em>R. v. Graat</em>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 819, at paras. 51-52,
    the Supreme Court suggests that non-expert opinion evidence is inadmissible
    unless: (1) by permitting the lay witness to testify in the form of an opinion,
    the witness is able more accurately to express the facts he or she perceived or
    (2) the facts from which a witness received an impression were too evanescent
    in their nature to be recollected or too complicated to be separately and
    distinctly narrated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span

    tenuous, and frequently false, antithesis between fact and opinion. The line
    between ‘fact’ and ‘opinion’ is not clear.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span

    Evidence, </em>5th ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2017), at p. 12-9:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Whatever the distinctions in
    justification for the admission of a compendious statement of fact and opinion
    where the facts are too subtle or complicated to be narrated separately and
    distinctly, the lay witness exception to the opinion evidence exclusionary rule
    requires the witness’s personal or direct acquaintance with the particular
    subject-matter and therefore some assurance of competence in source of
    knowledge. As well, the witness must have incidentally drawn inferences from
    observed data necessarily expressible in only abbreviated or conclusory form as
    opposed to a narration of individual factual observations or perceptions.</p>

    (4th) 1, at para. 76 the court makes clear that “the compendious statement of
    facts exception is limited to inferences drawn by non-expert witnesses who have
    personally observed the facts from which their inferences are drawn.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, Maraj (1) did not have personal knowledge of the observed facts –
    rather, she was asked to formulate her summary of the evidence in terms of her
    belief; (2) was in no better position than the jury to draw inferences from the
    evidence of the 12 taxpayers who testified combined with the raw data she
    collected; (3) had the experiential capacity to draw the inference – however,
    this is precisely what made the statement increasingly prejudicial; and (4)
    could have described the facts without testifying to the central question at
    issue. I am not persuaded that the jurors would inevitably have come to a
    conclusion of guilt absent her evidence.</p>

  <p class=CQuote>First, use of the curative proviso is appropriate where the
    error at first instance is “harmless or trivial”: <em>Sekhon</em>, at para. 53.
    The overriding question guiding this inquiry is whether the error “on its face
    or in its effect was so minor, so irrelevant to the ultimate issue in the
    trial, or so clearly non-prejudicial, that any reasonable judge or jury could
    not possibly have rendered a different verdict if the error had not been made”: <em>R. v. Van</em>, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] S.C.R. 22, at para. 35. When a case
    involves multiple errors at first instance, the cumulative impact of those
    errors can be relevant to determining whether the “harmless or trivial” test is
    satisfied: <em>R. v. Bomberry</em>, 2010 ONCA 542, 258 C.C.C. (3d) 117, at
    para. 79; <em>R. v. Hill</em>, 2015 ONCA 616, 23 C.R. (7th) 224, at para. 102.  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The curative proviso may also be applied in cases involving
    more serious errors, where the evidence is “so overwhelming” that a reasonable
    and properly instructed jury would inevitably convict: <em>Sekhon</em>, at
    para. 53; <em>Van</em>, at para. 36. This inquiry does not turn on the gravity
    of the trial judge’s errors, but on the strength of the Crown’s case.
    “Overwhelming evidence” has been described as a high standard, and
    “substantially higher than the requirement that the Crown prove its case
    ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ at trial”: <em>R. v. Trochym</em>, 2007 SCC 6,
    [2007] 1 S.C.R. 239, at para. 82. These onerous thresholds flow from the
    difficulties appellate courts inevitably face in “evaluating the strength of
