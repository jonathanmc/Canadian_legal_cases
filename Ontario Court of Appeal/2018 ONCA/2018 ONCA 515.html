    Justice Sean Dunphy of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Hourigan J.A. (Dissenting):</p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted by a jury of one count of intentionally discharging
    a firearm while reckless as to the life or safety of another person (<em>Criminal
    Code</em>, s. 244.2(1)(b)) and one count of occupying a motor vehicle while
    knowing there was a firearm in the vehicle (s. 94(1)). He appeals his
    convictions on the ground that they are unreasonable. I agree, and would
    therefore allow his appeal on both offences.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening of August 12, 2015, the appellant borrowed his mother’s
    Nissan Maxima and drove to 237 Roywood Drive to visit his god sister and
    Rikisha Reddon Barrow, an ex-girlfriend. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At some point overnight, the Maxima’s tires were slashed and the windshield
    was damaged. Ms. Reddon Barrow advised the appellant that Shakur Foster, her
    former boyfriend, had slashed the tires. Witnesses testified that the appellant
    was angry when he learned that the Maxima’s tires had been slashed, although
    the Crown and defence drew different inferences about how angry the appellant
    had become.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were security cameras at the Roywood complex and they captured the
    following events on August 13.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 2:10 p.m., the appellant exited 237 Roywood while Connie Reddon, Ms. Reddon
    Barrow’s mother, tried to restrain him. Ms. Reddon testified that she was
    trying to prevent the appellant from going to 239 Roywood to confront Mr.
    Foster. The appellant returned to 237 Roywood after the confrontation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At around 2:40 p.m., a black SUV arrived at the Roywood complex parking
    lot. Within seconds, the appellant emerged from 237 Roywood with his backpack.
    The appellant boarded the SUV through the front passenger side door. The SUV then
    left the parking lot and returned to the lot in reverse. The video surveillance
    shows the appellant then exit the SUV and retrieve something in a bag from the
    Maxima. There was no evidence to suggest that either that bag or the
    appellant’s backpack contained a gun.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant got back into the SUV and it exited the parking lot. The SUV
    stopped in the street in front of a pathway leading to a playground between 235
    and 239 Roywood. Mr. Foster was standing in the backyard of 239 Roywood. The
    driver of the SUV fired several shots and then sped off. Mr. Foster testified
    that he heard a ricochet off the fence in the backyard where he was standing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no evidence regarding the identity of the SUV driver. A search
    of the appellant’s cell phone did not provide any evidence that he contacted
    someone to pick him up before the SUV arrived at 237 Roywood. Despite Mr.
    Foster’s testimony, no bullet was located in the backyard. A shell casing was
    found in the street.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Trial</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown did not allege that the appellant had fired the gun. Its
    theory was that the appellant counselled the SUV driver to shoot at or near Mr.
    Foster as retaliation for the damage done to his mother’s car. The Crown
    conceded that there was no direct evidence of counselling and instead invited
    the jury to infer counselling from a number of facts, including: the appellant
    was one of only two people in the SUV, the shooting was directed at Mr. Foster
    who the appellant had been told slashed his mother’s tires, and the appellant
    knew where Mr. Foster was located. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence suggested that the circumstantial evidence was consistent with a number
    of possibilities other than the appellant having counselled the driver to shoot.
    One possibility the defence put forward was that the appellant told the driver
    about the damage to his mother’s car and the driver took it upon himself to
    avenge the appellant without any counselling.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury convicted the appellant of the two counts appealed from and acquitted him of
    intentionally discharging a firearm with the intent to endanger Mr. Foster’s
    life.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counselling Discharge of a Firearm </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    assessing whether a verdict was reasonable, an appellate court asks whether, on
    the whole of the evidence, the verdict is one that a properly instructed jury,
    acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. The court does not ask
    whether it would have convicted the appellant, but whether the verdict is
    supportable on any reasonable view of the evidence: <em>R. v. McCracken</em>,
    2016 ONCA 228, 348 O.A.C. 267, at paras. 23-24.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case against the appellant on this count was based entirely on circumstantial
    evidence. The Crown provided a plausible narrative to support its contention
    that the appellant counselled the SUV driver to shoot at Mr. Foster. However,
    in cases where the proof of one or more of the elements of the offence depends
    exclusively or largely on circumstantial evidence, an inference of guilt must
    be the only reasonable available inference. This ensures that the trier of fact
    will not “fill in the blanks” in the evidence by overlooking reasonable
    alternative inferences: <em>R. v. Villaroman</em>, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R.
    1000, at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case at bar, there was no evidence that the appellant summoned the SUV
    driver. There was also no evidence regarding what was said, if anything,
    between the appellant and the SUV driver. Did the appellant counsel the driver
    to shoot at Mr. Foster? It is possible that that was exactly what he did. But
    it is also possible that it was the driver’s intention to shoot at Mr. Foster
    without any counselling from the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral submissions, the Crown says that any alternative inference is entirely speculative
    because it lacks evidential support. In <em>Villaroman,</em> at para. 36, Justice
    Cromwell, writing for the court, rejected a similar argument: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>I agree with the respondent’s position that a
    reasonable doubt, or theory alternative to guilt, is not rendered “speculative”
    by the mere fact that it arises from a lack of evidence. As stated by this
    Court in </span><em>Lifchus</em><span lang=EN>,<i> </i>a reasonable doubt “is a
    doubt based on reason and common sense which must be logically based upon the
    evidence <u>or lack of evidence</u>”: para. 30 (emphasis added). A certain gap
    in the evidence may result in inferences other than guilt. But those inferences
    must be reasonable given the evidence and the absence of evidence, assessed
    logically, and in light of human experience and common sense.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the court noted in <em>Villaroman, </em>at para. 38, the distinction between a
    plausible theory and speculation may sometimes be fine. The trier of fact is
    required to look logically at the evidence or absence of evidence, in light of
    human experience, to determine whether an inference other than guilt may reasonably
    be drawn.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the appellant did not testify to offer a plausible alternative
    version of events is of no assistance to the Crown in this case. Appellate courts
    may refer to an accused’s silence as indicative of an absence of an exculpatory
    explanation when considering an unreasonable verdict argument on appeal.
    However, the accused’s failure to testify is generally relevant only in cases
    where the Crown has adduced a compelling body of evidence: <em>R. v. Noble</em><span
lang=EN-US>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, at para. 103.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>In </span><em>R. v. LePage</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><i> </i><span class=reflex3-alt><span lang=EN>[1995] 1 S.C.R. 654</span></span><span
class=reflex3-block><span lang=EN>, at paras. 29-30, a majority of the Supreme
    Court of Canada endorsed the following statement from </span></span><em>R. v.
    Johnson</em><span lang=EN> (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 340 (C.A.): “No adverse
    inference can be drawn if there is no case to answer. A weak prosecution's case
    cannot be strengthened by the failure of the accused to testify.” See also </span><em>R.
    v. Hay</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2009 ONCA 398, 249 O.A.C. 24, at para. 37<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>; and </span><em>R. v. Tremble</em><span
lang=EN-US>, </span><span lang=EN style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>2017 ONCA 671,
    354 C.C.C. (3d) 27, at para. 98.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>Thus, while the jurisprudence makes clear that the accused’s failure to
    testify may be taken into account in assessing whether there is an innocent
    inference available, it would make little sense to factor in that failure when reasonable
    innocent explanations are already apparent by looking at the gaps in the
    Crown’s case. In </span>the case at bar, the evidence against the appellant
    that he had counselled the SUV driver to shoot at Mr. Foster was weak. It would
    have been foolhardy for any competent defence lawyer to advise a client to
    testify in these circumstances. There was simply no need to call evidence to
    support an alternative version of events.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    my view, there was a lacuna in the evidence such that no trier of fact acting
    reasonably could have concluded that there was no reasonable inference other
    than guilt.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Occupying
    a Motor Vehicle</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>The foregoing analysis is equally applicable to the conviction on
    occupying the vehicle with knowledge of the gun, which was also based entirely
    on circumstantial evidence. There were innocent explanations available to the
    jury on the evidence and lack of evidence adduced at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>There was no evidence to support any suggestion that the appellant
    brought the gun into the SUV himself. It is impossible to say with any degree
    of certainty when the appellant became aware of the presence of the gun in the SUV.
    There was also no evidence whether, knowing that the gun was present, he had
    any feasible opportunity to exit the SUV. At the time of the shooting, the
    appellant was obviously aware of the presence of the gun, but the video
    surveillance showed that the vehicle left the area at high speed, which would
    make it impossible for him to safely exit the SUV. There was no evidence of
    what happened thereafter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>In my view, no properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably
    have convicted the appellant on this count.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions, and
    enter acquittals in their place.<b> </b></p>

    that he heard a ricochet off the fence. A shell casing was found in the street.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury convicted the appellant of intentionally discharging a firearm while reckless
    as to the life or safety of another person<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and occupying a motor vehicle while knowing there was a firearm in the vehicle.
    The jury acquitted the appellant of intentionally discharging a firearm with
    the intent to endanger Foster’s life.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the time frame in which the events captured by security cameras unfolded
    (2:10-2:40 p.m.), the appellant’s condition (demonstrably angry), his conduct
    (confronting Foster at his home), and the final constellation of criminal
    activity (a car arrives, the appellant immediately enters it, and the driver
    almost immediately fires four shots in the vicinity of Foster), I think the
    jury’s verdicts on the three counts are reasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Presumably,
    the jury determined that the appellant counselled the unknown driver to fire
    shots in the vicinity of Foster and was in the car when the driver did so.
    However, the jury was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooter
    intended to endanger Foster’s life, possibly because of the lack of ballistic
    evidence about where the four shots struck. In my view, this is an entirely
    reasonable set of verdicts for the jury to have rendered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague emphasizes that since the case against the appellant was based
    entirely on circumstantial evidence, an inference of guilt must have been the
    only reasonable available inference: see <em>R. v. Villaroman</em>, 2016 SCC
    33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 30. He determines that there was another
    reasonable inference available in this case: that the driver intended to shoot
    at Foster without any counselling from the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I note that the appellant did not testify at trial. In my view, his failure to
    testify negates the alternative inference my colleague identifies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    recognized by my colleague, appellate courts may refer to an accused’s silence
    as indicative of an absence of an exculpatory explanation when considering an
    unreasonable verdict argument on appeal: <em>R. v. Noble</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, at para. 103</span>. However, relying on <em>R. v. Lepage</em>,
    [1995] 1 S.C.R. 654, at paras. 29-30, my colleague concludes that no adverse
    inference can be drawn from the appellant not testifying in this case because
    there was “no case to answer.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I disagree. The facts I set out above established a strong case to
    answer, namely, that the appellant: was angry; had already overcome persuasion
    and resistance (his ex-girlfriend’s mother); had gone to Foster’s home and
    confronted him; very soon thereafter (several minutes at most) joined a man he
    knew in a car who had a firearm; and participated in an enterprise in which
    four shots were fired near Foster and his backyard. In my view, this is a
    paradigm of a case to meet, far removed from “no case to answer”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court is therefore entitled to consider the appellant’s failure to testify in
    assessing whether an innocent inference was available: <em>Noble</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 103.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was in the car during the events in question. He obviously knows who
    the driver/shooter was. He also obviously knows what happened leading up the
    shooting. Yet, he did not provide an innocent explanation at trial. It was not
    unreasonable for the jury to consider this and conclude there was no <span
lang=EN-US>exculpatory explanation or innocent inference available. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    make a final point. Appellate courts should be very cautious about declaring a
    jury verdict unreasonable. By definition, this issue is only considered if a
    criminal trial has been a fair trial from start to finish and if the trial
    judge’s jury charge is unimpeachable. In this context, it is no light thing to
    conclude that a unanimous verdict of 12 jurors is unreasonable, that is, not
    “supportable on <em>any</em> reasonable view of the evidence”: <em>McCracken</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 24 (emphasis in original)</span></em>. In
    my view, the jury’s verdicts in this case are far removed from deserving this
    label.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.</p>
