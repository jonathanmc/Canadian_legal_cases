  <p class=Judge><strong>Hourigan J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The primary issue on these appeals is the availability of the defence of
    entrapment in the context of police investigations of “dial&#8209;a&#8209;dope”
    schemes, which are operations in which a prospective drug buyer contacts a
    seller by phone and arranges to purchase drugs at a specific location. Acting
    on tips, the police in both cases contacted Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad respectively
    and arranged to purchase drugs from them. After the two men were found guilty
    of various drug-related and other offences, they applied for stays of
    proceedings on the basis that the police had entrapped them into committing the
    offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Mr. Williams’ case, the trial judge agreed that he had been entrapped
    and stayed charges against him for trafficking crack cocaine and possession of
    the proceeds of crime. He rejected Mr. Williams’ argument, however, that
    charges stemming from his arrest for firearm, ammunition, and breach of
    recognizance offences should also be stayed because they were “inextricably
    linked” to the entrapment, or alternatively, that the evidence of those
    offences should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. Mr.
    Williams was accordingly convicted of the other offences. The Crown appeals from
    the stay of the trafficking and proceeds of crime charges and Mr. Williams
    cross-appeals against his firearm, ammunition, and breach convictions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Mr. Ahmad’s case, the trial judge rejected his application for a stay
    of proceedings on the basis of entrapment. He was convicted of possession of
    cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime.
    He appeals against his conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons set forth below, I would allow the Crown appeal in Mr.
    Williams’ case and dismiss his cross-appeal. I would also dismiss Mr. Ahmad’s
    appeal. In my view, the police in both cases were acting pursuant to a <em>bona
    fide</em> inquiry as the term should properly be understood in current policing
    and accordingly the defence of entrapment is not available to Mr. Williams or
    Mr. Ahmad. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Background Facts</p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Williams’ Appeal</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The investigation that led to the charges against Mr. Williams began
    when Police Constable Christopher Fitkin of the Toronto Police Service (“TPS”)
    received a tip from a confidential source. The source indicated that a person
    by the name of “Jay” was selling cocaine in a particular area of Toronto and
    provided “Jay’s” phone number. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the source information, P.C. Fitkin put together a Person of
    Interest (“POI”) package identifying Mr. Williams as “Jay”. It is not clear how
    the link between Mr. Williams and “Jay” was made. The POI package included Mr.
    Williams’ photograph, date of birth, physical description, and home address. It
    specified that Mr. Williams used the alias “Jay” and that he had dealt drugs on
    several occasions at 389 Church Street. It included a criminal record check
    that indicated that Mr. Williams had a prior conviction for possession of a narcotic
    and was out on bail for drug offences. Under the heading “Source Information”,
    the POI package indicated that Mr. Williams was “a cocaine dealer in the area
    of 389 Church Street and Yonge &amp; Dundas” and provided the phone number he
    used.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 31, 2011, P.C. Fitkin contacted Detective Constable Brooke
    Hewson of the TPS Drug Squad and asked her to investigate by having an
    undercover officer “cold call” the phone number. In an email sent on January
    31, 2011, with the subject line “Drug Dealer ‘JAY’”, P.C. Fitkin wrote the
    following:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Hey Brooke,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[Redacted sentence]. I have some info as well that
    i was hoping you could try a cold call on. I haven’t been able to get ahold of
    my source to get a drop name yet but will continue to try.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[Redacted sentence].</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Please find attached a POI package that I put
    together about the drug dealer.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>P.S. He was done by Margetson’s team in 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Thanks Chris</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.C. Hewson was familiar with Mr. Williams. She had been involved in his
    arrest in 2009 for trafficking cocaine, when Mr. Williams was a young person
    under the <em>Youth Criminal Justice Act</em>, S.C. 2002, c. 1. That case had
    ended in 2010 when Mr. Williams pleaded guilty to simple possession of cocaine.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After receiving P.C. Fitkin’s email, D.C. Hewson ran the phone number
    provided through TPS databases, but the search derived no information. She made
    no inquiries of P.C. Fitkin about his source’s reliability or about how the
    name “Jay” had been connected to Mr. Williams.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 11, 2011, the TPS Drug Squad held a briefing on the case and
    determined that D.C. Tony Canepa would make the cold call to the phone number. D.C.
    Canepa, a 39-year veteran of the TPS at the time of trial, was provided some
    basic details regarding the target, namely his name (“Jay”), telephone number,
    and the nature of the drug. D.C. Canepa was also shown a photo of Mr. Williams,
    and D.C. Hewson told him that she had dealt with Mr. Williams in the past, but
    did not go into detail. Based on his past experience as an undercover police
    officer, D.C. Canepa chose not to ask for further information before making the
    call.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    same evening, D.C. Canepa called the number he was given. The following
    conversation occurred: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Hello.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: Jay?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Yeah.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: You around?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Who is this?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: It’s Vinny.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Vinny who?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: Vinny. Jesse from Queen and Jarvis gave
    me your name … your number. Said you could help me out. I need 80.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Okay. You have to come to me.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: Okay. Where?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Queen and Dufferin.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: Okay. It’ll take me a few because I’m at
    Yonge &amp; Bloor.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Okay, hurry up.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: I’ll call you when I get there.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Okay. What you want, soft or hard?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Canepa: Hard. Hard buddy.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Okay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>D.C. Canepa testified that in saying “I need 80” and “Hard”, he was
    looking for $80 of crack cocaine. He also testified that “You around?” was
    meant to ask whether the male was in the area and available to “deal”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>After several further calls, D.C. Canepa met Mr. Williams and bought
    $80 of crack cocaine from him. On February 22, 2011, he arranged a second
    transaction and bought another $80 of crack cocaine.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>On March 15, 2011, police arrested Mr. Williams. During a subsequent
    search, police found a handgun and a box of ammunition in his clothing. He was
    also carrying a small amount of marijuana and two cell phones.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>Mr. Williams was charged with </span>trafficking crack cocaine,
    possession of the proceeds of crime, and various firearm, ammunition, and
    breach of recognizance offences. The trafficking and proceeds of crime charges
    related to the drug transactions; the other offences arose from the search
    subsequent to his arrest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Mr. Williams admitted that the evidence established his guilt of the
    drug transaction offences but argued that the charges should be stayed on the
    basis that they were the product of entrapment. The trial judge agreed and
    entered a stay of proceedings on those charges. The trial judge reasoned that
    the police did not have a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Williams was involved
    in drug trafficking when they first provided him with the opportunity to commit
    an offence. As a result, the trial judge stayed the drug transaction charges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the same police conduct, Mr. Williams also sought a stay <span lang=EN>of
    the charges arising from his arrest or, in the alternative, the exclusion of the
    evidence of those offences under s. 24(2) of the </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN>. The trial judge disagreed, concluding that the charges from the
    arrest were not the product of entrapment and that the evidence was not
    obtained in a manner that infringed Mr. Williams’ s. 7 </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN> rights. He further concluded that there were no breaches of Mr.
    Williams’ ss. 8 and 9 </span><em>Charter </em><span lang=EN>rights. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>The Crown appeals and Mr. Williams cross-appeals. The Crown argues that
    Mr. Williams was not entrapped and that the stay of proceedings on the drug
    charges should be set aside and a conviction entered. Mr. Williams
    cross-appeals, arguing that the charges arising from his arrest should be
    stayed as an abuse of process because they are inextricably linked to the
    entrapment, or that the firearm and ammunition evidence should be excluded
    under s. 24(2) of the </span><em>Charter </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>because
    the evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed Mr. Williams’ s. 7 </span></em><em>Charter </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>rights</span></em><span lang=EN>. </span></p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Ahmad’s Appeal</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>On April 19, 2012, D.C. Michael Limsiaco, a member of the TPS Drug
    Squad, received information from another police officer about a possible
    dial-a-dope scheme. The tipster had indicated that an individual by the name of
    “Romeo” was selling powder cocaine and provided the phone number he was using. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>Following up on the tip, D.C. Limsiaco called the number. He did not
    undertake any investigation into the information that the other officer
    provided him before doing so. He testified that he made two calls, and made notes
    about 20 to 30 minutes after the second call. He indicated that his notes were
    not verbatim, but there was no dispute that they substantively reflected the content
    of the calls. According to D.C. Limsiaco’s notes, the following conversation
    occurred during the first call: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Male: Hello.</span></p>

    Squad went to Yorkdale Mall to purchase the drugs. D.C. Limsiaco received a
    text from the same phone number he had called directing him to go to the tables
    near the theatre. Once near the theatre, he called the phone number and saw a
    male walking toward him answer his phone. He described the male as looking
    Middle Eastern, measuring about 5’8”, weighing 160 pounds, wearing a black
    leather coat and black jeans, and having bushy eyebrows, short dark hair, and
    black-rimmed glasses. Detective Rodney Benson, another member of the

    and backpack, police recovered a large quantity of cocaine and cash (including
    the $140 in buy money from D.C. Limsiaco), a beige envelope with “Romeo”

    met his friend “Mikey” at Yorkdale Mall and implied that it was Mikey, not him,
    who had sold D.C. Limsiaco the drugs. The trial judge found that Mr. Ahmad’s

    Mr. Ahmad was engaged in criminal activity when Mr. Ahmad asked him, “What do
    you need?” Since the offer to buy drugs was not made until after this point and
    the steps in the preceding conversation were legitimate investigative steps,
    not opportunities for Mr. Ahmad to commit a crime, there was no entrapment. The

    entrapment is the Supreme Court’s decision in </span><em>R. v. Mack</em><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903. In setting out the
    contours of the entrapment doctrine, Lamer J., as he then was, sought to
    balance two competing objectives. On the one hand, he recognized that the
    police must be given considerable latitude in their investigation of crime,
    especially consensual crimes such as drug trafficking where traditional
    investigative techniques may be ineffective: </span><em>Mack</em><span lang=EN

    8, affirmed: 2010 SCC 50, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 62. On the other hand, he
    acknowledged that the police do not have unlimited power to randomly test the
    virtue of individuals and manipulate them to obtain convictions: </span><em>Mack</em><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>, at pp. 941, 959; </span><em>Imoro</em><span

lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>Entrapment is a variant of the abuse of
    process doctrine. If an accused can show that the strategy the state used to
    obtain a conviction exceeded permissible limits, “a judicial condonation of the
    prosecution would by definition offend the community” and the accused is
    entitled to a stay of proceedings: </span><em>Mack</em><span lang=EN

    entrapment allegation and the substantial leeway given to the state to develop
    techniques to fight crime, a finding of entrapment and a stay of proceedings
    should be granted only in the “clearest of cases”: </span><em>Mack</em><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>, at pp. 975-76. The accused must establish
    the defence on a balance of probabilities: </span><em>Mack</em><span lang=EN

lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>In </span><em>Mack</em><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>, at pp. 964-65, the Supreme Court set out the two
    principal categories of entrapment. The defence is available when either:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>1) “</span>the authorities provide a person with
    an opportunity to commit an offence without acting on a reasonable suspicion
    that this person is already engaged in criminal activity or pursuant to a <em>bona
    fide</em> inquiry”; or</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2) “although having such a reasonable suspicion or acting in
    the course of a <em>bona fide </em>inquiry, they go beyond providing an
    opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties in both these appeals agree that there was no inducement and thus the
    issue of whether Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad were entrapped should be determined
    under the first category. More specifically, at trial, both cases were
    principally argued on the basis of whether the police had a reasonable
    suspicion that Mr. Ahmad and Mr. Williams were already engaged in criminal
    activity when the police presented them an opportunity to commit an offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In Mr. Williams’ case, the trial judge found that the
    police did not have reasonable suspicion that he was involved in drug
    trafficking when they provided him the opportunity to commit an offence by
    saying “I need 80”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge reasoned that the police were allowed
    to investigate the tip by calling the number and engaging Mr. Williams in
    conversation. They could not, however, give him an opportunity to commit a
    crime until they had formed a reasonable suspicion that he was engaged in
    selling drugs. In the trial judge’s view, D.C. Canepa’s request to purchase a
    specific quantity of drugs amounted to an opportunity and was made in the
    absence of a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Williams was engaged in selling
    drugs. As a result, he had been entrapped and was entitled to a stay of the
    drug-related charges.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In Mr. Ahmad’s case, in contrast, the trial judge
    found that he had not been entrapped. The trial judge explained that it was a
    legitimate first investigative step for the police to call Mr. Ahmad based on
    the information from the tipster. </span><span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>The
    fact that he did not deny being Romeo or query the name was significant and
    permitted the police to proceed in the conversation. Confirmation that Mr.
    Ahmad was a drug dealer and reasonable suspicion was formed when he asked “What
    do you need?” in response to D.C. Limsiaco’s question “Can you help me out?”
    Importantly, this occurred before any opportunity to sell drugs was given. As a
    result, there was no entrapment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent
    with this court’s decision in <em>R. v. Ralph</em>, 2014 ONCA 3, 313 O.A.C.
    384, at para. 32, leave to appeal refused: [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 262, the trial
    judges in both these cases were<span lang=EN> attentive to the words used and
    the sequence of the conversation in determining whether Mr. Williams and Mr.
    Ahmad had been entrapped. As Rosenberg J.A. observed in </span><em>Ralph</em><span
lang=EN>, “[t]he exact words of the telephone conversation are important”
    (para. 2).</span><span lang=EN> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges further recognized that the reasonable suspicion requirement
    distinguishes between whether the language police use constitutes a mere
    investigative step, which is permissible absent reasonable suspicion, or an
    opportunity to commit an offence, which is not: see e.g. <em>Ralph</em>, at
    para. 32; <em>Imoro</em>, at paras. 13-17; <em>R. v. Olazo</em>, 2012 BCCA 59,
    316 B.C.A.C. 176, at paras. 19-24. While the line between an investigative step
    and an opportunity is sometimes difficult to draw, the jurisprudence suggests
    that it is crossed in the dial-a-dope context when the police make a specific
    offer to purchase drugs as opposed to engage in a more general conversation
    aimed at confirming a tip: see <em>Ralph</em>, at para. 32; <em>R. v. Swan</em><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>, 2009 BCCA 142, 269 B.C.A.C. 38, at para. 29;
    see also </span><em>Imoro</em>, at para. 16. Indeed, if making a specific offer
    to purchase drugs is not an opportunity, it is difficult to imagine what the
    police could say to a suspected drug trafficker that amounts to an opportunity
    but still falls short of inducement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>At the same time, however, in distinguishing
    between investigative steps and opportunities, courts must not lose sight of
    the underlying purpose of the entrapment doctrine, which is to prevent the
    state from investigating possible illegal activity in a way that offends our
    sense of decency and fair play: see </span><em>R. v. Pearson</em><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 620, at para. 11;</span><em><span
lang=EN> </span></em><em>R. v. Clothier</em><span lang=EN style='line-height:
200%'>, 2011 ONCA 27, 273 O.A.C. 162, at para. 47. While courts must be careful
    not to condone unfair police practices, an overly technical approach to the
    entrapment doctrine risks detaching the doctrine from its purpose and unduly
    restricting police conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>Bearing these principles in mind, I return to </span><em>Mack</em><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>. As noted above, </span><em>Mack</em><span
lang=EN style='line-height:200%'> sets out two categories of entrapment. These
    appeals concern the first category, under which entrapment </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>arises if the police provide a person an opportunity
    to commit an offence without acting either: (i) on a reasonable suspicion that
    the person is already engaged in criminal activity, or (ii) pursuant to a </span><em>bona
    fide</em><span style='line-height:200%'> inquiry. As Lamer J. explained, “[t]he
    absence of a reasonable suspicion or a </span><em>bona fide</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> inquiry is significant in assessing the police
    conduct because of the risk that the police will attract people who would not
    otherwise have any involvement in a crime and because it is not a proper use of
    the police power to simply go out and test the virtue of people on a random
    basis”: </span><em>Mack</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, at p. 965.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Mack</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> did not define the threshold of evidence required to
    meet the “reasonable suspicion” standard. Although arising in the context of
    searches, the Supreme Court’s comments in </span><em>R. v. Chehil</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, about the
    reasonable suspicion standard are instructive. In that case, Karakatsanis J.
    explained that reasonable suspicion is “a robust standard determined on the
    totality of the circumstances, based on objectively discernible facts, and is
    subject to independent and rigorous judicial scrutiny” (para. 3). In the
    entrapment context, appellate courts have agreed that the standard requires
    “something more than a mere suspicion and something less than a belief based
    upon reasonable and probable grounds”: </span><em>Chehil</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>,</span><em> </em><span style='line-height:200%'>at
    para. 26, citing </span><em>R. v. Kang-Brown</em><span style='line-height:200%'>,

lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>In these cases, I agree with Mr. Williams and

    any information conveyed to D.C. Hewson or anyone else involved in the
    investigation about the reliability of the source and the information the
    source provided. Although Mr. Williams had a criminal history, this information
    alone could not elevate police suspicion that Mr. Williams was engaged in
    criminal activity above mere suspicion. As a result, the trial judge correctly

    and the name “Romeo” to connect on the phone with the prospective drug dealer.
    The information was provided to him by another police officer from a tipster. D.C.
    Limsiaco testified that no investigation of the information occurred. There

    investigating and repressing criminal activity; and (2) the police directed
    their investigation at a specific area where they reasonably suspected that drug-related
    crimes were occurring: see pp. 460-62. Since dial-a-dope schemes do not have
    fixed locations, it would be impracticable to require the police direct their
    investigation at a specific area. Rather, if the police reasonably suspect that

    napkins or torn-up pieces of paper with phone numbers on them to more extensive
    tips, and compiled them into a list. For almost all of the numbers called, there
    was no name or other information provided in association with the number. The
    accused, Mr. Swan, received one of the calls from an undercover officer who
    asked him if he was “working”. When he responded in the affirmative, she told

    More specifically, the police had proceeded with their investigation with the

    had performed certain checks with respect to the number, but there were no
    details regarding the nature of these checks. An undercover officer called the
    number and a male with a “thick Asian accent” responded. There was some dispute
    whether the officer asked “Can you hook me up with an eight ball?” or waited to

    because the police were engaged in a <em>bona fide </em>investigation. Distinguishing <em>Swan</em> in this regard Bennett J.A. explained that, “[t]he call [in <em>Le</em>]
    was not part of hundreds of random calls, like <em>Swan</em>, but fell within a <em>bona fide </em>investigation or inquiry, having regard to the difficulty of
    investigating dial-a-dope offences and not confining dial-a-dope to a known
    location because of the mobile nature of the crime” (para. 96).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the Alberta Court of Appeal briefly considered, without deciding,
    whether a phone number connected to drug activity is analogous to a geographic
    location as in <em>Barnes</em>. In <em>R. v. Gladue</em>, 2012 ABCA 143, 524
    A.R. 237, leave to appeal refused: [2012] S.C.C.A. No. 305, the police called
    the accused based on a tip from a first time informant with a criminal record.
    The tip included a phone number being used to sell crack cocaine in a
    dial-a-dope scheme. Nothing was done to verify the tip. The officer called,
    asked the accused if he was “working” or “rolling”, and said he wanted to buy
    “four for a hundred”. The court upheld the trial judge’s conclusion that the
    police did not have reasonable suspicion that the accused was engaged in
    criminal activity before providing him with an opportunity to commit a crime.
    The court also rejected the Crown’s alternative argument that the police were
    engaged in a <em>bona fide </em>inquiry. With respect to the Crown’s submission
    that “a unique digital location” is analogous to the geographic location in <em>Barnes</em>,
    the court observed at paragraph 12:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Crown argues, for the first time on appeal, that, in
    calling the dial-a-doper number, the police were engaged in a <em>bona fide </em>investigation
    of a unique digital location similar in concept to the geographic location
    considered in <em>Barnes</em>. In <em>Barnes </em>at 461, the Supreme Court
    said “the police may present the opportunity to commit a particular crime to
    persons who are associated with a location where it is reasonably suspected
    that criminal activity is taking place.” Assuming, without deciding, that a
    phone can be equated to a specific physical location, the requirement for a
    reasonable suspicion must still be met. We have concluded that the reasonable
    suspicion requirement is not met on the facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Gladue </em>therefore left open whether a telephone line associated with a dial-a-dope
    scheme is similar to a “location” where it is reasonably suspected that
    criminal activity is taking place, as the concept of “location” is understood
    in <em>Barnes</em>. It also confirmed that the requirement of a reasonable
    suspicion must nevertheless be met for the police to be engaged in a <em>bona
    fide</em> inquiry: see also <em>Barnes</em>, at p. 463; Bruce A. MacFarlane,
    Robert J. Frater &amp; Croft Michaelson, <em>Drug Offences in Canada</em>, 4th
    ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2015), at s. 26:80.40. Importantly, however, the
    reasonable suspicion analysis for <em>bona fide</em> inquiries shifts away from
    a particular individual. In <em>Barnes</em>, it was directed at “a location
    where it [was] reasonably suspected that criminal activity [was] taking place”
    (p. 461). In a dial-a-dope case, where there is no set location, it should be
    directed at the phone line. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    concurrence suggests that it is incongruous for the police to reasonably
    suspect that a particular phone line is being used for a dial-a-dope scheme,
    but not reasonably suspect that the person who answers that phone to be engaged
    in drug trafficking. I disagree. Reasonable suspicion may be directed at a
    particular individual or, as in <em>Barnes</em> and these cases, a particular
    location or particular phone line. In <em>Barnes</em>, for instance, Lamer C.J.
    observed that the factors that drew the officer’s attention to the particular
    accused were not sufficient to give rise to reasonable suspicion that he
    specifically was engaged in criminal activity (p. 460). Rather, it was the fact
    that the accused was in a particular area where it was reasonably suspected
    that drug activity was occurring that allowed the police, as part of a <em>bona
    fide</em> inquiry, to present him with the opportunity to sell drugs (pp.
    461-62). In my view, in much the same way, when the police have reasonable
    suspicion that a phone line is being using in a dial-a-dope scheme, they should
    be allowed to provide opportunities to a person associated with that phone
    line, even if they do not have reasonable suspicion that the person is himself
    or herself engaged in drug-related activity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that, because reasonable suspicion may be directed at a particular
    individual, a particular location or a particular phone line, the relevant
    considerations will vary depending on the context. This means that certain
    facts may support a finding that the police had reasonable suspicion that a
    particular phone line is being <span lang=EN style='line-height:200%'>used in a
    dial-a-dope scheme, but not that the particular individual who is using that
    phone line is engaged in criminal activity, or vice-versa. While there may be
    overlap, different considerations may take on different weight in the analysis.
    For example, the fact that a phone line has been linked through a tip to the
    drug trade may take on greater importance in determining whether the police had
    reasonable suspicion the line was being used for criminal activity than when
    assessing whether the police had reasonable suspicion that a particular person
    using that line was already selling drugs. Reasonable suspicion must be assessed
    in the context of the particular case.</span></p>

    source who indicated that it was being used by a person named Jay to sell
    drugs. The person who answered the phone confirmed he was Jay, corroborating
    the source’s information and further focusing the police investigation. While
    the police did not have reasonable suspicion that Mr. Williams specifically was
    engaged in criminal activity, the objectively discernible facts support the
    police’s reasonable suspicion that the telephone line was being used to sell drugs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>This was not a random call, but rather a focused
    investigation. The source provided information both about the phone line being
    used in the dial-a-dope scheme and the name of the person using that phone line.
    While no inquiries appear to have been made about the source’s reliability, the
    source’s information about “Jay” was confirmed when the person who answered the
    phone replied positively to the name. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the police are not required to investigate
    the reliability of a source before embarking on a phone conversation. While
    information about a source’s reliability may in some circumstances provide
    reasonable suspicion that a phone line is being used in a dial-a-dope scheme,
    reasonable suspicion may also be developed in the course of the phone call,
    such as when the person who answers the call confirms the source’s information. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In Mr. Williams’ case, the police reasonably suspected
    that the phone line was being used in a dial-a-dope scheme when they presented
    the opportunity to commit a crime. As a result, they were engaged in a </span><em>bona
    fide </em><span style='line-height:200%'>inquiry at the time they gave Mr.
    Williams the opportunity to sell drugs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Similarly, the police were engaged in a </span><em>bona
    fide</em><span style='line-height:200%'> inquiry when they provided Mr. Ahmad
    with the opportunity to sell drugs. The police received a tip that a man named
    “Romeo” was selling cocaine. D.C. Limsiaco called Romeo’s phone number and
    asked if he was speaking to him. Although the person did not confirm or deny he
    was Romeo, he made no inquiries about the name. D.C. Limsiaco asked “you can
    help me out?”, a common phrase used to request drugs. The person responded
    “what do you need?”, another common phrase in the drug trade to ask what kind
    of drugs a buyer wants. D.C. Limsiaco then requested “two soft”, meaning two
    ounces of powder cocaine.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>In my view, the police again had reasonable suspicion
    that the phone line was being used in a dial-a-dope scheme by the time they
    provided Mr. Ahmad with an opportunity to sell drugs. While the objectively
    discernible facts do not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion that Mr.
    Ahmad specifically was already engaged in criminal activity, they do support
    reasonable suspicion that the phone line he was using was being used to sell
    drugs. More specifically, police were acting on a tip directed at a particular
    phone line. While the person who answered the call did not confirm he was
    Romeo, the name provided in the tip, he did not question the name. Moreover, he
    engaged in a conversation with an apparent stranger, using coded language
    familiar to the drug trade. Based on the totality of the circumstances, I find
    that the police had reasonable suspicion that the phone line was being used in
    a dial-a-dope scheme and were therefore engaged in a </span><em>bona fide</em><span

    and induced them to commit an offence. As a result, Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad
    have failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that they were
    entrapped. The police in both cases were acting pursuant to a </span><em>bona

    (para. 22). As the appellant argued, there was no obligation on Mr. Ahmad to do

    this result for different reasons than those of my colleagues.  In my view, the
    police in both cases acted on a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Williams and Mr.
    Ahmad were already engaged in criminal activity when they presented them with
    an opportunity to commit an offence.  Accordingly, there is no need to consider
    whether the police were acting pursuant to a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry. </p>

  <p class=Heading>Analysis</p>
  <p class=Heading>(a)     Overview of the “reasonable suspicion” requirement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the leading decision on entrapment, <em>R. v. Mack</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903,
    Lamer J. wrote the following at pp. 964-65:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]here is entrapment when, (a) the authorities provide a
    person with an opportunity to commit an offence without acting on a reasonable
    suspicion that this person is already engaged in criminal activity or pursuant
    to a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry; (b) although having such a reasonable
    suspicion or acting in the course of a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry, they go
    beyond providing an opportunity and induce the commission of an offence. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>See also <em>R. v. Barnes</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449,
    at p. 460.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rationale for this test is twofold. First, if there is no reasonable suspicion
    or <em>bona fide</em> inquiry, there is a risk that police will attract people
    who otherwise would not be involved in criminal activity to commit an offence,
    and, second, it is not a proper use of the police’s power to randomly test the
    virtue of people: <em>Barnes</em>, at p. 460; and <em>Mack</em>, at p. 965.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Entrapment is to
    be recognized in only the “clearest of cases”: <em>Mack</em>, at p. 976. The
    doctrine of entrapment will not apply if the police acted on a reasonable
    suspicion that the accused was already engaged in criminal activity when they
    presented the accused with an opportunity to commit an offence: <em>Barnes</em>,
    at p. 460; and <em>Mack</em>, at p. 964.  However, the presence of a reasonable
    suspicion or a <em>bona fide</em> inquiry will not justify police techniques
    that go beyond providing an opportunity: <em>Barnes</em>, at p. 460; and <em>Mack</em>,
    at p. 965. Once an accused has demonstrated that the police used tactics that
    went beyond acceptable limits, “judicial condonation of the prosecution would
    by definition offend the community”: <em>Mack</em>, at p. 976.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasonable
    suspicion requires “something more than a mere suspicion and something less
    than a belief based upon reasonable and probable grounds”: <em>R. v.</em> <em>Chehil</em>,
    2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, at para. 26; and <em>R. v. Kang</em><em><span

    2008 SCC 18, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 456, at para. 75. It “addresses the <em>possibility </em>of uncovering criminality, and not a <em>probability</em> of doing so”: <em>Chehil</em>,
    at para. 32; <em>Kang-Brown</em>, at para. 75; and <em>R. v. Ayangma</em>, 2016
    PECA 6, 375 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 73, at para. 37, leave to appeal refused,
    [2016] S.C.C.A. No. 271. Reasonable suspicion involves “a reasonable belief
    that an individual <em>might </em>be connected to a particular offence, as
    opposed to a reasonable belief that an individual <em>is</em> connected to the
    offence”: <em>R. v. MacKenzie</em>, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para.
    74. Even though a “hunch” or “feeling” will not give rise to a reasonable
    suspicion, the standard is “necessarily … low” and not “unduly onerous”: <em>Barnes</em>,
    at p. 460; <em>R. v. Cahill</em> (1993), 12 B.C.A.C. 247 (C.A.), at para. 35;

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reasonable
    suspicion involves “a minimal level of belief which does not rule out the
    possibility of innocent conduct or ‘other reasonable possibilities’”: <em>R. v.</em> <em>Williams</em>, 2010 ONSC 1698, at para. 44, citing <em>United States v.
    Gould</em>, 364 F. (3d) 578 (5th Cir. 2004), at p. 593. It “can be established
    with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to
    establish probable cause” and it can “arise from information that is less
    reliable than that required to show probable cause”: <em>Kang-Brown</em>, at
    para. 75, citing <em>Alabama v. White</em>, 496 U.S. 325 (1990), at p. 330.
    Although reasonable suspicion must be based on “objectively discernible facts”,
    “[w]hat will give rise to a reasonable suspicion … will vary from case to
    case”: <em>Chehil</em>, at para. 3; and <em>Cahill</em>, at para. 34.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme
    Court of Canada’s description of reasonable suspicion in <em>MacKenzie</em>, at
    para. 72 is instructive:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Exculpatory, common, neutral, or equivocal information should
    not be discarded when assessing a constellation of factors.  However, the test
    for reasonable suspicion will not be stymied when the factors which give rise
    to it are supportive of an innocent explanation.  We are looking here at
    possibilities, not probabilities.  Are the facts objectively indicative of the <em>possibility</em> of criminal behaviour in light of the totality of the circumstances?  If so,
    the objective component of the test will have been met.  If not, the inquiry is
    at an end.</p>
  <p class=Heading>(b)     Application to the cases at bar</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is my view
    that early on in their telephone conversations, the undercover officers
    acquired a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad were already
    engaged in criminal activity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Mr. Williams’
    case, (i) the police were acting on a tip that they had received from a
    confidential source, which indicated that a person by the name of “Jay” was
    using a certain phone number and selling cocaine in a particular area of
    Toronto, and (ii) the reliability of this tip was confirmed when the officer
    called the phone number and the person who answered immediately acknowledged
    that he was “Jay”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Mr. Ahmad’s
    case, (i) the police were again acting on a tip, which revealed that a person
    by the name of “Romeo” was selling powder cocaine and using the phone number
    647-207-9522, (ii) although the person who answered the call did not confirm he
    was “Romeo”, he did not question the name, and instead continued the dialogue,
    and (iii) the person who answered the call engaged in a conversation with an
    apparent stranger, using coded language familiar to the drug trade. When the
    officer stated “Matt said I can give you a call … said you can help me out?”
    the person who answered did not react with surprise or indignation or say “What
    do you mean?” or “What are you talking about?” or “You’ve got the wrong
    number.” Rather, his response was consistent with what a drug dealer would say:
    “What do you need?” This confirmed the reliability of the tip. See <em>R. v.
    Ralph</em>, 2011 ONSC 4125, at para. 34, aff’d 2014 ONCA 3, 313 O.A.C. 384,
    leave to appeal refused, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 262. He also responded as if he
    knew who the “Matt” used by the undercover officer in his backstory was, which
    confirmed the reliability of the tip further.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Mr.
    Ahmad’s response “What do you need?” to D.C. Limsiaco’s statement “said you can
    help me out?” is similar to Mr. Olazo’s positive response to the officer’s
    question “can you meet me” or “where are you” in <em>R. v. Olazo</em>, 2012
    BCCA 59, 316 B.C.A.C. 176, at paras. 8 and 26.  In that case, the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal concluded that Mr. Olazo’s response demonstrated a
    familiarity with drug terminology, helped to confirm the tip and, in doing so,
    established a reasonable suspicion: <em>Olazo</em>, at paras. 26, 30.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While my
    colleagues conclude that the police did not have a reasonable suspicion that
    Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad were already engaged in criminal activity, they do
    find that the police had a reasonable suspicion that the <em>phone lines</em> were being used for criminal activity. With respect, I do not agree with this
    approach. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, to
    suggest that an undercover officer can reasonably suspect that a particular
    phone line is being used for a dial-a-dope scheme, but not reasonably suspect
    that the person who answers that phone is engaged in such a scheme is to ignore
    a fundamental reality: phones are increasingly personal. Although some people
    might pick up their friend or relative’s phone when it rings, an undercover
    officer can still reasonably suspect that the person who answers is the user or
    owner of that phone. After all, in assessing reasonable suspicion “[w]e are
    looking … at possibilities, not probabilities”: <em>MacKenzie</em>, at para.
    72. Accordingly, in the dial-a-dope context, there is little real difference
    between information that the police obtain about the phone line and information
    that they obtain about the person who answers it. Quite often, information
    about the one is information about the other. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, my
    colleagues consider certain facts in concluding that the police reasonably
    suspected that the phone lines were being used for criminal activity, but it is
    unclear why these same facts could not have also supported a finding that there
    was a reasonable suspicion with respect to Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad’s
    involvement in criminal activity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, the
    majority relies on the fact that no information was conveyed about the reliability
    of the source and the information the source provided in finding that there was
    no reasonable suspicion that Mr. Williams was involved in a dial-a-dope scheme.
    However, in concluding that there was a reasonable suspicion that the phone
    line was being used for such a purpose, the majority explains at para. 75 that
    “the police are not required to investigate the reliability of a source before
    embarking on a phone conversation” and that “reasonable suspicion may also be
    developed in the course of the phone call, such as when the person who answers
    the call confirms the source’s information.” The fact that the source’s
    information about “Jay” was confirmed in the course of the phone call was used
    to find reasonable suspicion with respect to the phone line, but was not
    considered when assessing whether there was a reasonable suspicion with respect
    to Mr. Williams, even though it would have been equally relevant to that
    analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A similar
    concern arises in the analysis of Mr. Ahmad’s case. The trial judge found that
    a reasonable suspicion that Mr. Ahmad was already engaged in criminal activity
    was formed when he asked “What do you need?” in response to D.C. Limsiaco’s
    question “Can you help me out?” Although my colleagues rejected this
    conclusion, they later refer to the very same language at paras. 77 to 78 in
    finding that the undercover officer reasonably suspected that the phone line
    was being used in a dial-a-dope scheme:   </p>
  <p class=CQuote>… D.C. Limsiaco asked “you can help me out?”, a common phrase
    used to request drugs. The person responded “what do you need?”, another common
    phrase in the drug trade to ask what kind of drugs a buyer wants. …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>… While the person who answered the call did not confirm he was
    Romeo, the name provided in the tip, he did not question the name. Moreover, <span
class=Underline>he engaged in a conversation with an apparent stranger, using
    coded language familiar to the drug trade.</span> Based on the totality of the
    circumstances, I find that the police had reasonable suspicion that the phone
    line was being used in a dial-a-dope scheme and were therefore engaged in a <em>bona
    fide</em> inquiry. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>These facts equally apply to a finding that there was
    a reasonable suspicion with respect to Mr. Ahmad’s involvement in crime. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is also my
    view that the information obtained by the undercover officers later on in their
    conversations with Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad further solidified their
    reasonable suspicions. In particular, Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad’s responses to
    the officers’ statements that they needed “80” and “two soft” suggested that
    Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad were already involved in the drug trade, and neither
    of these statements by the officers constituted the giving of an opportunity to
    commit an offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In arriving at
    this conclusion that the officers’ statements did not amount to offers to
    purchase drugs, I follow the reasoning in two decisions of this court: <em>R.
    v.</em> <em>Imoro</em>, 2010 ONCA 122, 264 O.A.C. 362, aff’d 2010 SCC 50,
    [2010] 3 S.C.R. 62 and <em>R. v. Ralph</em>, 2014 ONCA 3, 313 O.A.C. 384, leave
    to appeal refused, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 262. In <em>Imoro</em>, at para. 8,
    Laskin J.A. considered the doctrine of entrapment outlined in <em>Mack,</em> which “reflects judicial disapproval of unacceptable police or prosecutorial
    conduct in investigating crimes”, and found at para. 15 that the trial judge
    had erred in finding that the officer’s question “Can you hook me up?” provided
    the accused with an opportunity to sell drugs. He stated at para. 15 that
    “[t]his mischaracterization stems from a failure to properly distinguish
    between legitimately investigating a tip and giving an opportunity to commit a
    crime”, citing <em>R. v. Townsend</em>, [1997] O.J. 6516 (Gen. Div.). The Court
    of Appeal held at para. 16 that the question “Can you hook me up?” was “simply
    a step in the police’s investigation of the anonymous tip” and “did not amount
    to giving Mr. Imoro an opportunity to traffic in drugs.” By asking “Can you
    hook me up?” all the officer was really asking Mr. Imoro was whether he was a
    drug dealer: <em>Imoro</em>, at para. 16. Laskin J.A. concluded at para. 17
    that there was no evidence to support the finding of entrapment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Ralph</em>,
    at para. 32, the Court of Appeal for Ontario agreed with the trial judge that
    entrapment was not made out in that case where police received information
    about a drug dealer who could be reached at a particular number. The undercover
    officer called the number and left a message for the person to call back: <em>Ralph</em>,
    at para. 29. Forty-one minutes later a male called back and they had a
    conversation which resulted in them meeting later that night and the officer
    purchasing 1.6 grams of cocaine: <em>Ralph</em>, at paras. 29, 30. Rosenberg
    J.A. held at para. 32 that the officer’s statement “I was at Jane and Finch and
    a kid said that if I want anything to call this number and this guy would link
    me up … I need product” is similar to the “Can you hook me up?” question in <em>Imoro</em>. 
    He wrote at para. 32: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>As found by the trial judge, it was a legitimate investigative
    step.  When the appellant responded as he did, this response together with the
    anonymous tip was, as found by the trial judge, sufficient to provide the
    officer with reasonable suspicion and justify the further statements from the
    officer.  This was not a case of random virtue testing and entrapment was not
    made out.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear from <em>Imoro</em> and <em>Ralph</em> that the court must distinguish between
    legitimately investigating a tip, such as by using veiled statements to ask
    whether the accused is a drug dealer, and giving an opportunity to commit a
    crime. However, these cases do not stand for the proposition that the police
    cross the line from “legitimately investigating” to “giving an opportunity”
    when they make a specific request for drugs, such as “I need 80” or I need “two
    soft”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>R. v. Le</em>, 2016 BCCA 155, 385
    B.C.A.C. 267, at para. 65, leave to appeal refused, [2016] S.C.C.A. No. 272,
    the court noted that much discussion in the appeal turned on whether the
    undercover officer investigating the dial-a-dope scheme had asked the appellant
    “Can you hook me up?” or “Can you hook me up <em>with an eight ball</em>?”
    (emphasis added), which is a more specific request for drugs. However, the
    Court of Appeal concluded that the specific language made no difference: <em>Le</em>,
    at para. 66. The court expressed the following concern at para. 93:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Defence counsel argued that there is a meaningful distinction
    between veiled statements asking if the other party is a drug dealer and more
    specific requests for types, quantities, or values of drugs. It was argued that
    the former statement is an investigatory step while the latter is an offer to
    commit an offence. Parsing the language of undercover drugs calls in
    dial-a-dope investigations in this way takes an unnecessarily narrow approach.
    It ignores the surrounding circumstances, but more importantly, it strays far
    from the core principle underlying <em>Mack.</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority in
    the cases at bar agrees with this concern at para. 39 of their reasons where
    they state that “an overly technical approach to the entrapment doctrine risks
    detaching the doctrine from its purpose and unduly restricting police conduct.”
    In <em>MacKenzie</em>, at para. 73, the Supreme Court took a similar position:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Assessing whether a particular constellation of facts gives
    rise to a reasonable suspicion should not — indeed must not — devolve into a
    scientific or metaphysical exercise. Common sense, flexibility, and practical
    everyday experience are the bywords, and they are to be applied through the
    eyes of a reasonable person armed with the knowledge, training and experience
    of the investigating officer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As <em>Le</em> indicates, it is inconsistent with the core principles underlying <em>Mack</em> to try to parse the language of undercover officers by distinguishing veiled
    statements asking if the other party is a drug dealer from specific requests
    for quantities of drugs. In other words, there is no meaningful distinction
    between asking someone “Can you hook me up?” — which is not an opportunity to
    commit a crime (see <em>Imoro</em>, at para. 16; and <em>Le</em>, at para. 92)
    — and specific requests such as “I need 80” or I need “two soft”. Accordingly,
    it is my view that an opportunity to commit an offence was not provided when
    the undercover officers in the cases at bar stated that they needed “80” and
    “two soft”. Neither had an opportunity been provided prior to that point. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A comparison of
    the officers’ statements in <em>Ralph</em> and Mr. Williams’ case illustrates
    the artificiality of attempting to parse the language that officers use in
    dial-a-dope investigations, as <em>Le</em> suggests. In Mr. Williams’ case,
    D.C. Canepa stated, “Jesse from Queen and Jarvis gave me your name … your
    number. Said you could help me out. I need 80.”  In <em>Ralph</em>, the
    undercover officer stated, “I was at Jane and Finch and a kid said that if I
    want anything to call this number and this guy would link me up ... I need
    product”, which was found to be a legitimate investigative step and not the
    giving of an opportunity. Both statements indicate that the officer in question
    was in contact with someone from an area of the city known for illicit activity,
    that this contact gave the officer the number of a person who could “help [him]
    out” or “link [him] up”, and that the officer needed drugs. The fact that the
    officer in one case stated that he needed “80” while the officer in the other
    indicated that he needed “product” is not a meaningful distinction given that
    both of these terms are references to drugs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying <em>Imoro</em>,<em> Ralph</em> and <em>Le </em>to the cases at bar, my view is that the information
    contained within Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad’s responses to the officers’
    requests for “80” and “two soft”, respectively, further solidified the
    officers’ reasonable suspicions. Mr. Williams responded “Okay. You have to come
    to me” to D.C. Canepa’s statement that he needed “80”, which suggests that Mr.
    Williams was already involved in the drug trade. The explanation provided by
    D.C. Canepa as to how he got Mr. Williams’ phone number — that Jesse from Queen
    and Jarvis gave him the name “Jay” and his number (suggesting needs that were
    illicit) and told him that “Jay” would help him out — was not questioned by Mr.
    Williams: see <em>Ralph</em>, 2011 ONSC 4125, at para. 34. Mr. Williams did not
    respond by saying “What are you talking about?” or by hanging up, as one would
    expect an innocent person to do in this situation. Rather, Mr. Williams
    responded affirmatively to D.C. Canepa’s statement that he needed “80”, a
    veiled reference to drugs. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Mr.
    Ahmad’s response to D.C. Limsiaco’s statement that he needed “two soft” —
    another reference to drugs — was to tell the officer that he would get back to
    him and, 15 minutes later, to call the officer back. Again, this response
    indicated that Mr. Ahmad understood the officer’s use of drug terminology and
    was considering what had been discussed. This would have further supported a
    reasonable suspicion about Mr. Ahmad’s involvement in the drug trade. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In both of these
    cases, Mr. Williams and Mr. Ahmad’s “own expression[s] of willingness to
    transact during the phone call[s] raised a reasonable suspicion”: <em>Le</em>,
    at para. 92. In my view, the reasonable suspicion crystallized before any offer
    to commit a crime occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, a
    necessarily-principled approach to the doctrine of entrapment leads to the same
    conclusion that entrapment is not made out in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasonable
    suspicion requirement under the entrapment doctrine seeks to prevent police
    conduct that will attract innocent and otherwise law-abiding individuals to
    commit a crime that they would not have otherwise committed: <em>Mack</em>, at
    pp. 957, 965; and <em>Le</em>, at para. 94. It was designed to target police
    “conduct that the citizenry cannot tolerate” and will only be recognized in the
    “clearest of cases”: <em>Mack</em>, at pp. 917, 976. Although the Supreme Court
    in <em>Mack </em>acknowledged that the power of the police to investigate
    criminal activity is not unlimited, it also sought to give the police
    considerable latitude so that they can effectively investigate crime: <em>Mack</em>,
    at pp. 917, 941; and <em>Imoro</em>, at paras. 8-9. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining
    whether the defence of entrapment has been made out it is essential that the
    court does not lose sight of these underlying reasons for recognizing the
    doctrine in the first place: <em>Mack</em>, at p. 965. However, some of the
    jurisprudence has done exactly that. A number of cases have narrowly focused on
    the minute language choices of the investigating officer to find entrapment
    despite the fact that the police conduct does not risk causing an innocent
    person to sell drugs. The court must never lose sight of the core question: is
    the police’s conduct really offensive?  As the Supreme Court identified in <em>Mack</em>,
    at p. 942, “[i]n the entrapment context, the court’s sense of justice is
    offended by the spectacle of an accused’s being convicted of an offence which
    is the work of the state”. Staying cases in which there is no actual offensive
    police conduct is harmful to the integrity of the administration of justice. It
    is crucial “that the police be allowed to carry out their duties without undue
    scepticism or the requirement that their every move be placed under a scanning
    electron microscope”: <em>MacKenzie</em>, at para. 65.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The British
    Columbia Court of Appeal’s comments in <em>Le</em>, at para. 95 are also apt
    here:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Objectively speaking, innocent and otherwise law-abiding
    individuals would not be “manipulated” or tempted to enter the dangerous and
    illicit drug trade if asked by a stranger over the phone to sell him drugs. It
    defies common sense to suggest that asking whether an individual is willing to
    sell specific types, quantities, or values of illicit drugs runs the “serious
    unnecessary risk” that an otherwise innocent person would then go out, procure
    the drugs, meet with and sell them to a stranger.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither Mr.
    Williams’ case nor Mr. Ahmad’s case is one of those “clearest of cases”
    warranting a stay based on entrapment: see <em>Mack</em>, at pp. 976-77. The
    police conduct in these cases did not carry the risk that innocent persons
    would commit a crime that they would have not otherwise committed. Neither was
    this conduct that the citizenry cannot tolerate. On the contrary, the police
    relied on legitimate investigative techniques that are responsive to the modern
    realities of the drug trade and its reliance on virtual spaces to evade police
    scrutiny.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Result </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these
    reasons, I would allow the Crown appeal in Mr. Williams’ case, dismiss his
    cross-appeal, dismiss Mr. Ahmad’s appeal and make the dispositions outlined by
    the majority.</p>
