    disposition detaining the appellant could not stand. The majority (Weiler and
    Huscroft JJ.A.) remitted the case to the Board to consider the appellant’s
    situation in light of the new risk assessment. Feldman J.A. would have granted

line-height:200%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.7. Earlier
    that year, the appellant was charged with producing a controlled substance
    (marijuana). In 2007, he received an eight-month conditional sentence for that
    offence, his only recorded conviction. The appellant was also charged with
    assault, mischief, and uttering threats in 2006, but those charges were
    withdrawn after he was found NCR for the index offences.</span></p>

    index offences commenced in the fall of 2006. The appellant made repeated calls
    and sent 17 letters to a woman with whom he had attended high school, but did
    not otherwise know. The letters were vulgar and sexually explicit. The woman lived
    with her parents at the time, and the appellant lived close by. The appellant
    was charged with criminal harassment on November 16, 2006. He was subsequently charged
    with two counts of failing to comply with his recognizance. He was found NCR on
    February 27, 2007.</span></p>

    appellant’s past diagnoses have included schizophrenia with antisocial and

    appellant has refused treatment while under the Board’s jurisdiction. Aided by
    his substitute decision maker (“SDM”), his mother, the appellant refuses anti-psychotic

    discussed below, the appellant’s failure to accept treatment for his mental
    illness troubled the Board.</span></p>

    appellant’s detention in psychiatric institutions has not been problem-free.
    There have been angry outbursts and aggressiveness, sometimes directed at
    hospital staff. However, over the course of the past 11 years, incidents of
    violence have been few and far between. In 2007, the appellant threatened two
    patients and took a swing at another when that patient called the appellant a “fucking
    goof.” In 2010, he punched and spat on another patient. His most recent verbal
    aggression, in 2013, involved three incidents within the span of a month at the
    Regional Mental Health Centre in St. Thomas. That same year, the appellant was
    transferred to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”) in Toronto.</span></p>

    2014, the appellant twice eloped from CAMH, for a combined duration of over two
    months. While he was AWOL, there were no further criminal charges. The
    appellant made no effort to contact the victim. Instead, he focused on
    obtaining treatment for his physical ailments, the principal one being Crohn’s
    disease.</span></p>

    appellant was transferred from CAMH to Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care
    (“Waypoint”) in February 2015. During his stay at Waypoint, a few incidents of
    verbal aggression were recorded. Additionally, on a single occasion, the
    appellant was observed alone in his room speaking in a threatening manner (“I
    will get you”) to a non-existent person.</span></p>

    appellant was moved to the North Bay Regional Health Centre (“North Bay”) in
    April 2016. Due to a shortage of psychiatrists, the hospital requested an early
    Board hearing to transfer the appellant. At this hearing, held in August 2016,
    the Board detained the appellant, ordering that he be placed at the secure
    forensic unit at Providence Care Centre in Kingston (“Providence”). He appealed
    that disposition to this court.</span></p>

    appeal from the disposition resulting in the appellant’s placement at
    Providence, both Providence and North Bay filed as fresh evidence the affidavit
    of Dr. Michael Chan, the appellant’s attending psychiatrist. The affidavit
    addressed the risk posed by the appellant, based on new psychological testing
    that occurred after the Board hearing.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It is
    necessary to place this new testing in context. At his initial disposition
    hearing in 2007, the appellant’s risk of recidivism was assessed as “extremely
    high, if not approaching certainty.” In December 2015, while he was at
    Waypoint, the appellant was assessed using the HCR-20, a clinical judgment tool
    designed to predict violent recidivism. He was assessed as a high risk for
    violent re-offence.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> In
    January 2017, before the hearing of the appeal, the appellant was assessed by
    Dr. Jan Looman, a clinical forensic psychologist. He met with the appellant for
    six hours over the course of three days, and reviewed previous hospital reports
    prepared for Board hearings, including previous risk assessments. In a written
    report, Dr. Looman addressed the appellant’s December 2015 rating on the HCR-20:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>This assessment suggested that [Mr. Krivicic] was [a] high risk
    for violent re-offence. However, Mr. Krivicic does not have a history of
    previous violence. Given this, it is not clear that this instrument is
    appropriate for assessing the risk for violence in this case. In addition, Mr.
    Krivicic has not acted out violently while in hospital, despite his obvious
    anger and frustration with what he sees as his unjust detention and inadequate
    medical care. Given that he is 38 years old and that risk for violence begins
    to decrease after the age of 40, it seems reasonable to assume that if Mr.
    Krivicic has not engaged in violence to this point he is unlikely to do so in
    the future. Previous research related to the initiation of violent offending
    indicates that the peak period is in the late teens and early 20s and very few
    people commit their first violence offence beyond that age. [Internal footnote
    omitted.]</p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Dr.
    Looman was concerned that, given the appellant’s index offences and lack of
    violent history, risk assessment tools predicting general violent recidivism
    may fail to meaningfully evaluate the appellant’s risk. He administered a more
    specific test – the Stalking Risk Profile (“SRP”), as the appellant’s index
    offence was “best characterized” as stalking. The SRP measures risk in three
    categories – risk of stalking violence, risk of persistence, and risk of
    reoccurrence. The appellant was determined to be a “low risk” across all three
    measures. Dr. Looman concluded that overall, the appellant presented a low risk
    for violence. These results formed the basis of an up-to-date medical report
    prepared by Dr. Chan, in which he endorsed Dr. Looman’s conclusion and opined
    that the appellant no longer met the significant threat threshold. Counsel who
    appeared on behalf of both North Bay and Providence supported this conclusion. Counsel
    for the Ministry of the Attorney General opposed it.</span></p>

    the evidence it relied on in making its prior dispositions” (para. 15). In
    remitting the appellant’s case back to the Board for an early hearing, Huscroft

    Feldman J.A. concluded, at para. 40:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, although the Board has not had an opportunity to

    at the Waypoint Centre for Mental Health. <span class=Underline>He was assessed
    as presenting a high risk at that time. Thus, the current assessment assigns
    him a lower level of risk than the previous assessment. In part this can be

    in the appellant’s case. As he explained:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>If it wasn’t for his refusing treatment, he would be at [a] low
    risk. <span class=Underline>What I’m saying is a lot of the symptoms he’s

    was out in the community where he could seek out the care that he wants and eat

    people out in the community who are walking around with all sorts of somatic

  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>His persecutory delusions are related to

    he’s lacking insight and he’s not complying with, you know, he’s not

    observations that the appellant did not exhibit recurring disordered thought
    patterns that are typical of schizophrenia. Recognizing that delusional disorder

    terms of the risk posed by the appellant if released into the community, Dr.

    treatments that he desires for his medical needs. On the other hand, there was
    an “outside possibility” that the day-to-day stress of living could create
    fluctuations in his mental state. However, Dr. Chan observed that, while
    detained, the appellant’s frustrations have not led to violence; instead, he
    has used legal means to pursue his grievances. Dr. Chan said, “At this point I
    don’t foresee that it will necessarily lead to disturbed or violent behaviour,

    the community, rather than doing so abruptly, without supports. As he said, “I
    would always prefer that approach.” However, he did not intend to release the
    appellant without any support. Dr. Chan said, “We would do our best to link him
    up with the mental health community services.” He acknowledged that being
    released from the forensic system could be a huge stressor, but “whether that
    will lead to risky scenarios, it’s </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;

    to Dr. Chan, the HCR-20<sup>V3</sup> exaggerated the appellant’s risk, largely
    because the instrument places significance on historical information that will
    never change. The fact that the appellant has refused treatment did not help.
    Dr. Chan said, “I’m not saying there would be no risk, I’m not saying that at
    all. There is risk and there will always be risk given the past. We can’t go
    back and change that.” However, by adding the SRP scores to the equation, Dr.
    Chan said, “We thought [it] would give a bigger picture and we think [his risk is]
    tempered a little bit, not down to very low, but it’s tempered a bit. In our
    opinion it’s dropped below the threshold. I mean, we can always make arguments

    Board found that the updated HCR-20<sup>V3</sup> risk assessment “significantly
    contradicts” the testimonial opinions of Drs. Looman and Chan. The Board’s
    ultimate conclusions are reflected in paras. 36-39:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Board is fully aware that in reaching a conclusion that Mr.
    Krivicic continues to represent a significant risk, it is reaching a conclusion
    different from both Dr. Chan and Dr. Looman. <span class=Underline>With
    respect, the Board cannot agree with their opinion that Mr. Krivicic no longer
    represents a significant threat.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Dr. Chan's support for his opinion, both in the Court of Appeal
    and before this Board, was founded on the assessment using the Stalking Risk
    Profile (SRP). Dr. Chan maintained this opinion before the Board notwithstanding
    his acknowledgement that the HCR-20 v3 Risk Assessment Tool reached a <span
class=Underline>fundamentally different conclusion</span>. He did acknowledge
    that granting Mr.&nbsp;<span class=cosearchterm><span style='color:#252525'>Krivicic</span></span>&nbsp;an
    absolute discharge and releasing him to the community without any form of
    support plan in place would likely be a significant stressor <span
class=Underline>potentially</span> leading to a risk to the safety of the
    public.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Dr. Looman's conclusion that there was not a significant risk
    was that the scoring on the HCR-20 v3 overstated the risk of violence. He went
    on to say that the lack of Mr.&nbsp;<span class=cosearchterm><span
style='color:#252525'>Krivicic's</span></span>&nbsp;insight into his illness is
    not related to his potential risk. Although it seemed that the main reason for
    rejecting the outcome of this assessment tool was that it was scored while
    Mr.&nbsp;<span class=cosearchterm><span style='color:#252525'>Krivicic</span></span>&nbsp;was
    in the hospital, Dr. Looman did eventually agree that the results would not be
    any different if scored with Mr.&nbsp;<span class=cosearchterm><span
style='color:#252525'>Krivicic</span></span>&nbsp;in the community.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Board is unanimous in rejecting Dr. Looman's evidence on
    the issue of significant risk. The HCR-20 v3 is a widely recognized and accepted
    assessment tool used internationally. Dr. Looman agreed with this point.
    Nothing in the evidence before the Board calls into doubt its value as one of
    the factors to be considered. <span class=Underline>When taken together with
    all the evidence outlined above, the Board is unanimous in concluding that
    Mr.&nbsp;Krivicic&nbsp;continues to represent a significant threat to the
    safety of the public</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    Board was concerned that an absolute discharge would be risky for the

    Moreover, the Board was critical of the appellant’s resistance to treatment
    both historically and looking to the future, and of Dr. Chan’s “reluctance to
    engage” with a treatment plan. Remarkably, the Board said, at para. 40, “the
    Board encourages the hospital to take whatever further steps might be available
    to pursue a treatment plan.” Essentially, the Board recommended that the
    hospital attempt to override the decisions of the appellant’s SDM, in direct
    opposition to the conciliatory approach taken by Dr. Chan.</span></p>

    and the submissions of counsel for the hospital and the appellant, did not

    reach this conclusion. There was no other evidence adduced before the Board.</span></p>

    re-offend. Standing alone, this fell short of the mark. The appellant’s refusal
    of treatment, along with his optimistic, yet vague plans for his life after 10
    years in hospital, could not properly fill this void. In detaining the

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> exaggerated
    the appellant’s risk because of his refusal to accept treatment while
    hospitalized, and because the test failed to account for the reduction in

    Dr. Looman did not launch a broad attack on the HCR-20; he agreed that it is a
    “valid and helpful” instrument. Presumably, that is why he administered the
    test. “Valid and helpful” is not synonymous with universally reliable. Dr.
    Looman and Dr. Chan merely used the test as an aid in assessing the appellant’s
    risk, in light of his specific diagnosis, presenting symptoms, and behaviour
    while detained. In their view, looking to the SRP in addition to the HCR-20<sup>V3</sup> provided a more holistic evaluation of the appellant’s risk in his unique
    circumstances. Their evidence stood uncontradicted.</span></p>

    his illness contributed to the index offences. Dr. Looman’s evidence must be
    seen in this light. While he acknowledged that refusing treatment is generally
    an important factor in assessing risk, it has less of a role to play in the
    appellant’s case because “a lot of the symptoms he’s currently presenting are
    unrelated to risk to the public.” Although it was open to the Board to reject
    Dr. Looman’s evidence, I have concerns that his position was not properly

    the seriousness or magnitude of that offending. The HCR-20<sup>V3</sup> says

    importantly, the HCR-20<sup>V3</sup> results did not stand alone. The Board also
    had the appellant’s SRP results, assessing the appellant as a low risk to
    re-offend in a manner similar to the index offences. The appellant’s score on
    this instrument caused this court to set aside the Board’s previous
    disposition. At the new hearing, while mentioned in its reasons, the Board essentially
    ignored the SRP score, noting that it was “fundamentally different” than the
    most recent HCR-20<sup>V3</sup> results.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This
    was an overstatement. After all, the appellant was rated as a “low risk” to re-offend
    on the SRP, and just a “moderate risk” on the HCR-20<sup>V3</sup>. Having
    rejected the explanations of Drs. Chan and Looman, and without evidence to the
    contrary, the Board was not in a position to make such a categorical finding.</span></p>

    all of these factors into consideration, I conclude that the Board’s

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In the
    end, the Board’s decision was driven by the appellant’s most recent risk
    assessment, his refusal to accept treatment, and the vague plan for his release.
    It seized upon Dr. Chan’s acknowledgement that it would be preferable to
    gradually release (or cascade) the appellant toward unfettered freedom in the community.
    Granted, it would probably be in the appellant’s interests to proceed in this
    cautious fashion. But that is not the test under s. 672.54: see </span><em><span

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Through
    its questions, the Board revealed its concern that the appellant would be under
    extreme stress if released without supervision. Dr. Chan acknowledged that this </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>could</span></em><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> worsen his symptoms and increase his risk. However, whether the appellant would
    act out in a way contemplated by s. 672.54 was a matter of pure speculation:
    see </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Re Pellett</span></em><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>, 2017
    ONCA 753, 139 O.R. (3d) 651. In fact, Dr. Chan expressed doubts that any
    problems the appellant could possibly have would rise to criminal conduct or
    physical violence. If anything, the uncontradicted evidence before the Board
    (from Drs. Looman and Chan, and the appellant) was that the appellant would
    likely be less stressed in the community because he would be able to pursue the
    remedies he desired for his medical ailments, likely with the support of his
    family. While it was open to the Board to reject all of this evidence, it did
    not constitute proof positive of the opposite, unless the onus were to be
    reversed. </span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Lastly,
    the Board was critical of Dr. Chan’s evidence, unfairly in my view, because he
    took a non-adversarial approach to the appellant’s refusal of treatment. However,
    Dr. Chan’s description of the appellant as “legally untreatable” reflected the
    appellant’s recorded history while detained – he continued to use the legal
    process to prevent involuntary treatment, as he was entitled to do. Again, this
    itself does not translate into a “significant risk to the safety of the
    public”, especially given the appellant’s more recent symptomology and the long
    passage of time since he has acted out in a violent or threatening manner.</span></p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>As mentioned
    above, at para. 53, onus is critical in the application of s. 672.54. It was
    critical in this case. While the appellant may have failed to persuade the
    Board that he was </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>not</span></em><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> a
    significant risk to the safety of the public, he was not required to do so. As

  <p class=CQuote>While the Board does not necessarily err because it declines to
    follow the expert’s or the hospital’s opinion and must make its own decision,
