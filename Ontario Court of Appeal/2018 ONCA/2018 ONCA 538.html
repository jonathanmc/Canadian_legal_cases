  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault of
    his neighbor and sentenced to two years less a day imprisonment, followed by three
    years’ probation. He argues that the trial judge made many errors and that the
    conviction should be set aside. He also seeks leave to appeal from the
    sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Findings of fact by the trial judge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We begin with a review of the findings of fact
    made by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant lived in an apartment next door
    to the appellant. She was in the process of moving out and her own apartment
    was nearly empty. She went next door to the appellant’s apartment to become
    reacquainted with his dog, as she had agreed to look after the animal for the
    appellant. The appellant invited her to sleep at his apartment, and assured her
    he would not bother her. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She sat on the couch and played with the dog.
    The appellant was smoking marijuana and drinking beer after beer. The
    complainant had taken evening medication prescribed for her before going over
    to play with the dog and began to feel drowsy and wobbly. She told the
    appellant she was going home, but he insisted she should sleep at his place.
    She acquiesced and lay down on a chaise chair and curled up with a blanket
    tucked under her shoulder. She wanted to go home, but was nervous about what
    the appellant might do, as she thought he was drunk and stoned. She was half
    asleep. The next thing she knew, the accused was standing over her and forcing
    intercourse on her. She told him it hurt and told him to stop. He continued
    until he ejaculated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant had no memory of what happened
    afterwards. She attributed this to illnesses from which she suffered. She had a
    vague memory of going to the Smith Falls hospital. Hospital records show that
    she arrived in the emergency department at 3:08 in the morning. She asked for
    the morning after pill, but refused to be subjected to a sexual assault
    examination at the hospital because of previous traumatic experiences at that
    hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant testified that she was fully
    present when the appellant raped her, and that she told him “no”. The trial
    judge found that the complainant’s evidence was “unequivocal, unshaken and
    uncontroverted.” He was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that intercourse
    had occurred and that the complainant had not consented.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Honest but mistaken belief in consent</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in concluding that there was no air of reality to mistaken belief in consent:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In the present
    case there is not even a mere assertion that the accused held an honest but
    mistaken belief in consent.  There is no evidence to support the assertion….</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Testimony by an accused is not a prerequisite to
    an argument that the accused lacked the mental state necessary to support
    conviction. However, there must be some evidence to show that the “complainant
    communicated consent to engage in the sexual activity in question” and that the
    accused believed she had communicated that consent: <em>R. v. Ewanchuk</em>, </span>[1999]
    1 S.C.R. 330<span lang=EN-US>, at para. 46. That evidence may be derived from
    the circumstances surrounding the event and the behavior of the involved
    parties. Here, however, there is no evidence of any words, conduct or
    circumstance suggesting consent by the complainant and no evidence that the
    appellant believed that</span> the complainant communicated<em> </em>consent<span
lang=EN-US>. Under these circumstances, the trial judge did not err in
    concluding that there was no air of reality to any suggestion of honest but
    mistaken belief in consent.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Undue emphasis on the complainant’s demeanor</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial counsel spent considerable time cross-examining
    the complainant on her history of mental illness. She suffered from bi-polar
    disorder, p</span>ost-traumatic stress disorder and dissociative disorder<span
lang=EN-US>. The purpose of this examination was to suggest that her evidence
    might be unreliable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge addressed these suggestions in
    his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Dealing next with the complainants
    admitted mental health issues. First, I observe nothing in the complainant’s
    demeanor while she was testifying to give me concern that her mental illness
    diminishes, or negatively affects her ability to give credible, and reliable
    evidence. The complainant was certainly assertive by times in answering certain
    questions. That said, there was no manifestation of dissociative behavior
    during her evidence. The complainant listened to the question, and gave
    thoughtful, articulate and honest answers in my view. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This was appropriately responsive to the
    approach taken by defence counsel and does not reflect an overemphasis on demeanor
    evidence. The trial judge did not agree that because the complainant suffered
    from the mental illnesses described, she was not a reliable or credible
    witness. There is no basis to interfere with that conclusion, to which
    deference is owed: <em>R. v. Dinardo, </em>2008 SCC 24, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 788, at
    para. 26.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Unreasonable verdict</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was</span><span lang=EN-US
style='line-height:200%'> </span><span lang=EN-US>uncontradicted evidence
    before the trial judge, that he found credible, that the appellant had sexual
    intercourse with the complainant without her consent. A trier of fact could
    reasonably have reached the conclusion that the appellant was guilty of sexual
    assault. The trial judge dealt with defence arguments said to raise doubt about
    the complainant’s credibility. For example, that the complainant withdrew an
    unrelated complaint of domestic violence against a partner, and that the
    complainant sat in close proximity to the appellant at a public tenants’
    meeting after the alleged assault. The trial judge did not find these to be factors
    undermining her credibility. The trial judge also dealt with the complainant’s
    refusal to undergo a sexual assault examination at the hospital and her
    statements at the hospital, as recorded on the hospital records, as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>If anything, the medical record
    corroborates the complainants subjective view at the time of the sexual
    activity in question, and her evidence at trial….</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>There is no basis to conclude that the
    trial judge’s findings of credibility were unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Prior consistent statement</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge used
    the complainant’s prior consistent statements improperly, as
    self-corroboration. The hospital records containing notes about statements made
    by the complainant were admitted on consent, however, there was no agreement
    expressed on the record as to the purpose for which those records were
    admitted, except perhaps, to avoid calling the doctor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The handwritten records seem to record the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Further,
    notwithstanding what is recorded in Exhibit One, the complainant maintained at
    trial that she told the accused that “it hurts” and “stop”. Admittedly, Exhibit
    One is less clear. There is a question mark beside the word “consensual”.
    Moreover, the complainant reportedly “didn’t say no”. However there was also a
    record of the complainant reporting that “she didn’t want to”, which I find
    goes to her actual, subjective consent, and is consistent with her evidence at
    trial. The complainant also reportedly said that it, “the intercourse”, was
    “painful”, that “she is not sure if he heard, or ignored her say that”. Thus,
    these aspects of the contemporaneous note are consistent with the complainant’s
    evidence at trial that the accused was hurting her as he was penetrating her
    with his penis, and that she said so, whether he heard it, or simply ignored
    her.</span></p>
