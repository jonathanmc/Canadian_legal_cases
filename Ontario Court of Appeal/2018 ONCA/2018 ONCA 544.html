  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

    Christopher Staines, commenced a class action against sixteen groups of
    financial institutions on September 11, 2015, alleging a price-fixing
    conspiracy in the foreign exchange or foreign currency market between January
    1, 2003 and December 31, 2013. The statement of claim includes allegations that
    the defendants (including the proposed defendants) took active steps to conceal
    their participation in the conspiracy by, among other things, engaging in
    secret communications. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first group of defendants to settle
    consisted of UBS AG, UBS Securities LLC and UBS Bank (Canada) (collectively
    “UBS”). The settlement required UBS to cooperate with the appellants. In
    fulfilling that obligation, UBS gave an evidentiary proffer on May 24, 2016. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 20, 2016, Mr. Staines brought a motion
    under r. 5.04(2) and r. 26.01 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</span></em><span lang=EN-US> to add the respondents to the action.
    The respondents opposed the motion on the basis that the claim against them was
    barred by the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Limitations Act, 2002</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched B. (the “Act”) and the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Competition Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, RSC 1985, c. C-34. No
    defendant had filed a statement of </span>defence<span lang=EN-US> and no
    discovery had taken place at the time that the motion was heard.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Class counsel’s evidence on the motion was that
    they learned of BMO and TD’s involvement in the alleged conspiracy for the
    first time at the UBS proffer. UBS advised class counsel that it reviewed
    approximately 2000 collusive chats dating as far back as 2008 and that FX
    traders at TD and BMO were among the persons participating in such chats. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Class counsel’s further evidence was that from
    the time prior to commencement of the action to the date of UBS’s evidentiary
    proffer on May 24, 2016, they conducted their own investigations into the
    alleged conspiracy. Their investigations included a review of public documents
    and none of the public documents referred to or mentioned BMO or TD as being
    involved in the alleged conspiracy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his reasons, the motion judge acknowledged
    that there was no evidence that any public documents identified BMO or TD as
    being involved in the alleged conspiracy. He accepted that the appellants did
    not know they had a conspiracy claim against the respondents until they
    obtained the UBS evidentiary proffer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, at para. 61 of his reasons, the motion
    judge found as a fact that the appellants’ evidence on the motion was
    “insufficient to establish that they behaved as reasonable person[s] in the
    same or similar circumstances to identify [the respondents] as conspirators and
    the evidence rather establishes that their identity could have been established
    with reasonable diligence before the expiry of the limitation period.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>As to what other steps the appellants should have taken, the motion
    judge wrote, at para. 49:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Plaintiffs, through their counsel,
    testified that the Plaintiffs were investigating, but there is scant evidence
    about how they were investigating, and there is no evidence about any efforts
    to hire a private investor [sic], efforts to contact potential witnesses or
    whistleblowers, efforts to obtain information from Plaintiffs’ counsel in the
    U.S. litigation, or efforts to contact regulatory or law enforcement agencies.
    It also appears that the Plaintiffs before or after commencing their action did
    not bring a motion for an </span><em>Anton Pillar</em><span lang=EN-US> Order,
    a civil search warrant, or a </span><em>Norwich</em><span lang=EN-US> Order,
    under which a plaintiff may obtain discovery from a person including a person
    against whom there is no cause of action in order to identify a wrongdoer and
    to obtain information about wrongdoing so that the plaintiff may bring
    proceedings or at least consider whether to bring proceedings against the
    wrongdoer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At para. 51, the motion judge reasoned that the
    fact that UBS was able to identify BMO and TD as participants in the “chat room
    shenanigans by reviewing the ‘collusive chats’” demonstrated that it was
    possible to identify other alleged co-conspirators. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He wrote, at para. 57, that “…if the plaintiffs
    were to take on the mantle of representative plaintiff to achieve access to
    justice and behaviour modification, they should have acted more like the
    investigation arm of a regulator and [conducted] a meaningful investigation.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge dismissed the appellants’
    motion.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Framework</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The framework in the Act informs the necessary
    analysis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In most Ontario cases, including this one, an
    action must be started on or before “the second anniversary of the day on which
    the claim was discovered.” If it is not, the claim is barred by s. 4 of the
    Act. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, the appellants sought to amend their claim
    to include the respondents on July 20, 2016. Working backwards, the appellants’
    claim against the respondents is statute-barred if they discovered it before
    July 20, 2014.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 5 of the Act sets out the scheme for
    determining when a claim is discovered. It provides in relevant part as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>5 (1) A claim is discovered on the earlier of,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>   (a)  the day on which the person with the
    claim first knew,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>          (i)      that the injury, loss or
    damage had occurred,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>          (ii)      that the injury, loss or
    damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or omission,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>          (iii)     that the act or omission
    was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>          (iv)     that, having regard to the
    nature of the injury, loss or damage, a proceeding would be an appropriate
    means to seek to remedy it; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(b) the day on which a reasonable person with
    the abilities and in the circumstances of the person with the claim first ought
    to have known of the matters referred to in clause (a).  2002, c. 24, Sched. B,
    s. 5 (1).</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Presumption</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(2)  A person with a claim shall be presumed
    to have known of the matters referred to in clause (1) (a) on the day the act
    or omission on which the claim is based took place, unless the contrary is
    proved.  2002, c. 24, Sched. B, s. 5 (2).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the purposes of the motion, the presumption
    in s. 5(2) of the Act was displaced: the motion judge accepted that the
    appellants subjectively did not know they had a conspiracy claim against BMO
    and TD until the UBS proffer. Thus, the date for the purposes of s. 5(1)(a) of
    the Act was May 24, 2016.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents effectively asserted that the
    appellants “first ought to have known” that they had a claim against the
    respondents before July 20, 2014. In other words, the respondents assert that
    the s. 5(1)(b) date was both before May 24, 2016 and before July 20, 2014. If
    the s. 5(1)(b) date were not before July 20, 2014, the appellants’ claim would
    not be statute barred.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Having accepted that the appellants did not
    subjectively know they had a conspiracy claim against BMO and TD until May 24,
    2016, the issue to be determined by the motion judge under s. 5(1)(b) was
    whether the appellants had a reasonable explanation on proper evidence as to
    why they could not have discovered their claim against the respondents before
    July 20, 2014 through the exercise of reasonable diligence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While the common law discoverability principle
    is expressly enshrined in ss. 4 and 5 of the Act, the statutory limitation

    principle by establishing too high an evidentiary threshold on the motion

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When a person opposes a plaintiff’s motion to
    add it as a defendant on the basis of the apparent expiry of a limitation
    period, the motion judge is entitled to assess the record to determine whether,
    as a question of fact, there is a reasonable explanation on proper evidence as
    to why the plaintiff could not have discovered its claim through the exercise
    of reasonable diligence. If the plaintiff does not raise any credibility issue
    or issue of fact about when its claim was discovered that would merit
    consideration on a summary judgment motion or a trial and there is no
    reasonable explanation on the evidence as to why the plaintiff could not have
    discovered the claim by exercising reasonable diligence, the motion judge may
    deny the plaintiff’s motion: <em>Arcari v. Dawson</em>, 2016 ONCA 715, 134 O.R.
    (3d) 36, at para. 10.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, the evidentiary threshold that must be
    met by a plaintiff on such a motion is low: <em>Pepper v. Zellers Inc.</em> (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 648 (C.A.), at para. 14; </span><em>Burtch v. Barnes
    Estate</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>(2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 365, at paras. 26-27.

    (3d) 272, at para.15, aff’d 2006 CarswellOnt 286 (Div. Ct.). Whether the
    plaintiff and its counsel acted with reasonable diligence must be considered in
    context: <em>Fanshawe College of Applied Arts and Technology v. Sony Optiarc
    Inc.</em>, 2014 ONSC 2856, at para. 45 (the “Fanshawe Pleadings Motion”.) </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While <em>Arcari</em>, <em>Pepper</em> and <em>Wakelin</em> dealt with motions to add defendants that were opposed based on the apparent
    expiry of the limitation period under the Act, the same approach, and the same
    low threshold, is warranted where the motion is opposed or also opposed based
    on the apparent expiry of any statutory limitation period subject to the
    discoverability principle: see, for example, Fanshawe Pleadings Motion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the context of a motion to add defendants in
    a class action alleging a secret conspiracy brought before any statements of
    defence had been filed or any discoveries had taken place, the motion judge
    required the appellants to meet too high an evidentiary threshold.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Giving the requisite generous, contextual
    reading to the appellants’ explanation, the appellants provided a reasonable
    explanation why they could not have identified the respondents as
    co-conspirators before July 20, 2014. I note that in the Fanshawe Pleadings
    Motion, the motion judge permitted plaintiffs alleging a price-fixing
    conspiracy to amend their statement of claim to add defendants on evidence as
    to due diligence that essentially consisted of reviewing publically available
    documents, albeit a more detailed list of those documents was provided. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the face of the appellant’s evidence of their
    search for other potential defendants, the respondents led no evidence of
    further reasonable steps that the appellants could have taken to ascertain
    their identities before July 20, 2014. Rather, the motion judge suggested that
    the appellants should have taken further steps to investigate whether the
    respondents were co-conspirators. At least some of the steps he suggested go
    beyond those a reasonable plaintiff would have taken in the circumstances,
    indicating that he held the appellants to too high an evidentiary standard. By
    way of example, it is not apparent how a plaintiff alleging a conspiracy that
    the defendants took active steps to conceal and that was conducted through
    secret “chats” could have possibly obtained the suggested <em>Anton Pillar</em> and <em>Norwich</em> orders. The evidentiary foundation required to obtain such
    orders is high.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, a representative plaintiff is not akin
    to the investigative arm of a regulator. Regulators often have investigative
    powers that civil plaintiffs do not. There was no evidence that any of the
    sophisticated regulators investigating the alleged conspiracy had identified
    any of the respondents as co-conspirators before the UBS proffer. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A plaintiff’s failure to take reasonable steps
    to investigate a claim is not a stand-alone or independent ground to find a
    claim out of time. Instead, the reasonable steps a plaintiff ought to take is a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where the issue on a motion to add a defendant
    is due diligence, the motion judge will not be in a position to dismiss the plaintiff’s
    motion in the absence of evidence that the plaintiff could have obtained the
    requisite information with due diligence, and by when the plaintiff could have
    obtained such information, such that there is no issue of credibility or fact
    warranting a trial or summary judgment motion: <em>Wong v. Adler</em> (2004), 70
    O.R. (3d) 460 (Ont Master), at para. 45; </span><em>Pepper</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As the respondents appropriately conceded, there
    was no evidentiary foundation for the motion judge’s finding that the
    respondents’ identities as co-conspirators could have been established with
    reasonable diligence. The fact that UBS – one of the co-conspirators and a
    participant in the “collusive chats” – was able to identify other participants
    in the secret chats is no indication that the appellants, who were not
    co-conspirators, could have done so.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor did the motion judge determine with
    sufficient precision by when the appellants ought to have discovered that they
    had a claim. As noted above, the appellants claim would be statute barred only
    if the s. 5(1)(b) date were before July 20, 2014. The motion judge found the
    identity of BMO and TD could have been established “before the expiry of the
    limitation period”. It is not clear what the motion judge meant by “the expiry
    of the limitation period”. The respondents submitted that the limitation period
    expired on December 31, 2015 (two years after the end of the alleged conspiracy
    period). If the motion judge’s intended finding were that the appellants could
    have established the identities of BMO and TD by December 31, 2015, then the
    appellants’ claim against them would not have been statute-barred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue of whether the appellants could have
    discovered the identities of the respondents with due diligence and, if so,
    when the appellants could have done so, are issues that require consideration
    on a summary judgment motion or at trial. The motion judge should have
    permitted the appellants to add the respondents as defendants, and reserved the
    respondents’ right to plead a limitation defence.</span></p>
