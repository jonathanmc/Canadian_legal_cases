    (Justices Katherine E. Swinton, Carolyn J. Horkins and Michael G. Emery), dated
    February 2, 2017, with reasons reported at 2017 ONSC 642, dismissing an
    application for judicial review from an order of the Information and Privacy
    Commissioner of Ontario, dated August 7, 2015.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Benotto J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are a child-client’s litigation records with the Children’s Lawyer for
    Ontario subject to a father’s freedom of information access request? The answer
    turns on whether the records are “in the custody or under the control” of the Ministry
    of the Attorney General for Ontario (“MAG”) for purposes of the <em>Freedom of
    Information and Protection of Privacy Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.31 (“<em>FIPPA</em>”). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Assistant Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (the “Adjudicator”
    and the “IPC”) determined they were and ordered that MAG respond to the
    father’s request. The Divisional Court upheld the Adjudicator’s order on
    judicial review.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have concluded that the Adjudicator’s decision should be reviewed for
    correctness and that it cannot stand. The issue on appeal involves matters of
    central importance to the administration of justice and is outside the
    Adjudicator’s specialized expertise. As I will explain, the Adjudicator’s
    decision is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the role and function of
    the Children’s Lawyer, her relationship to MAG, and her duty to provide
    children with the heightened protection the law mandates. This decision is not
    in the best interests of children. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal. </p>
  <p class=Heading>STATUTORY PROVISIONS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before addressing the facts and decisions below, it is helpful to
    summarize the various statutes that inform the appeal. The following are
    relevant: (i) <em>FIPPA</em> – which governs access to information; (ii) <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>the </span></em><em>Courts of Justice Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (the “<em>CJA</em>”) – which provides for the appointment
    of the Children’s Lawyer; and (iii) several other statutory provisions – which
    establish the functions of the Children’s Lawyer.</p>
  <h3><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em>FIPPA</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>FIPPA</em> has two purposes: to provide access to information and to
    protect individuals’ privacy as it relates to that information. These are set
    out in s. 1:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>1 The purposes of this Act are,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(a) <u>to provide a right of access to
    information under the control of institutions</u> in accordance with the
    principles that,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(i) information
    should be available to the public,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(ii) necessary
    exemptions from the right of access should be limited and specific, and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(iii) decisions on
    the disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently of
    government; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(b) to protect the
    privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves
    held by institutions and to provide individuals with a right of access to that
    information. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 10(1), every person has a right to access records or part of
    records in the custody or under the control of an institution, subject to
    certain exemptions:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>10(1) … [E]very person has a right of access to a record or a
    part of a record <u>in the custody or under the control of an institution</u> unless, </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) The record or the part of the record falls within one of
    the exemptions under sections 12 to 22; or</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) The head is of the opinion on
    reasonable grounds that the request for access is frivolous or vexatious.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to s. 2(1) “institution” includes “a ministry of the Government
    of Ontario”. MAG is captured by this definition.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exemptions under ss. 12-22, and their exceptions, relate to various
    matters. Of note, s. 19 creates an exemption for records that are subject to
    solicitor-client privilege: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>19 A head may refuse to disclose a record,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(a) that is subject to solicitor-client
    privilege; </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(b) that was prepared by or for Crown counsel for
    use in giving legal advice or in contemplation of or for use in litigation; or</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(c) that was
    prepared by or for counsel employed or retained by an educational institution
    or a hospital for use in giving legal advice or in contemplation of or for use
    in litigation.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    children were the subject of a custody and access dispute between their
    parents. In 2008, when the children were nine and eleven years old, McCartney
    J. appointed the Children’s Lawyer and requested that she conduct an
    investigation, report and make recommendations pursuant to s. 112(1) of the <em>CJA</em>.
    The Children’s Lawyer determined that she would provide legal representation to
    the children pursuant to s. 89(3.1) of the <em>CJA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. She also </span></em>assigned a clinical investigator
    to assist counsel.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May, 2010 Warkentin J. made a final order terminating the father’s access to
    the children as well as all forms of verbal communication. In 2012, the father
    brought a motion to change. Coats J. referred the matter, again, to the Children’s
    Lawyer. The Children’s Lawyer decided to provide legal representation to the
    children, this time without the assistance of a clinical investigator. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 23, 2014 the father requested access to information from MAG pursuant
    to <em>FIPPA</em>. He sought records in the Children’s Lawyer’s litigation
    files, including:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Privileged and non-privileged reports relating to the children;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All documents filed with the court, including settlement reports,
    medical reports, psychological and educational reports, filed conversations and
    notes, and transcripts; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All notes and information relating to the duties of the lawyers

  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MAG denies the father’s request </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer took the position that <em>FIPPA</em> does not apply to
    private litigation files involving her provision of services to children.<em> </em>She
    emphasized that her office is an independent office within MAG, appointed by
    the Lieutenant Governor in Council under s. 89 of the <em>CJA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>; she</span></em> represents the independent legal
    interests of children and does not act on behalf of MAG or the Crown. She determined
    that since the records the father requested were prepared or collected in the
    course of her independent legal representation of the children, they are not
    within MAG’s custody or under its control.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the Children’s Lawyer’s position, MAG advised the father that it does not have custody
    or control of the records and <em>FIPPA</em> does not apply.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal to the IPC</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father appealed MAG’s decision to the IPC. The Adjudicator determined that the sole
    issue before her was whether MAG has custody or control of the requested
    records. She noted that resolving this issue did not necessarily mean the
    father would be provided access to the records – even when records are in the
    custody or control of an institution, they may be excluded under one of <em>FIPPA</em>’s
    exemptions or may be subject to an overriding confidentiality provision enacted
    in another statute. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Adjudicator concluded that the records at issue are in MAG’s custody or
    control. She identified two “overriding considerations” leading to this
    conclusion: “the undisputed fact that the [Children’s Lawyer] is a branch of
    [MAG]”; and that “the records at issue were generated in the course of the [Children’s
    Lawyer] fulfilling its core mandate.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Adjudicator rejected the submission that the Children’s Lawyer is distinct from
    MAG. She noted that the Children’s Lawyer operates as a branch within the
    formal structure of MAG, is accountable to MAG for the expenditure of public
    funds, records related to such expenditures are subject to <em>FIPPA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, and the Children’s Lawyer </span></em>has no
    separate administrative structure from MAG. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Adjudicator similarly rejected the Children’s Lawyer’s submission that while she
    is “part of” MAG with respect to some records for the purposes of <em>FIPPA</em>,
    she is not “part of” MAG with respect to others. The Adjudicator stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The result urged by the
    [Children’s Lawyer] would treat some of its records as excluded from [<em>FIPPA</em>]
    when it is engaged in certain functions, while other records would be subject
    to [<em>FIPPA</em>]. While [<em>FIPPA</em>] itself provides for such a result,
    through the exclusion of some categories of records, the [Children’s Lawyer’s]
    submissions would, in effect, amount to an indirect recognition of an
    additional exclusion which has not been explicitly legislated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Adjudicator further rejected the submission that the Children’s Lawyer’s
    fiduciary duties to her child clients are incompatible with access rights under <em>FIPPA</em>. She determined that confidentiality concerns could be addressed
    by the exemptions under <em>FIPPA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    including s. 19 relating to solicitor-client privilege</span></em>. She
    similarly determined that subjecting the Children’s Lawyer’s litigation files
    to access requests did not give rise to an “intolerable conflict” as urged by
    the Children’s Lawyer. She noted that the Children’s Lawyer is authorized by
    the Attorney General to respond to access requests and has been doing so since
    1998. Yet, no conflicts between the Children’s Lawyer, her child clients, or
    MAG appear to have impeded this task to date. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the Adjudicator assessed the factors typically applied to determine whether records
    are in the custody or control of an institution. She held that since the
    Children’s Lawyer is a branch of MAG, “it would be redundant to ask whether the
    [Children’s Lawyer] ‘could reasonably be expected’ to obtain the records at
    issue.” Instead she determined that the Children’s Lawyer has the right to the
    files; the records were created in carrying out activities central to the
    Children’s Lawyer’s mandate; and the Children’s Lawyer has the authority to
    regulate the use of its records, subject to its fiduciary and legal obligations
    to its child clients. She concluded that the records were therefore in MAG’s
    custody or under its control. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Adjudicator ordered MAG to issue an access decision to the father, which could be
    made by the Children’s Lawyer.  </p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional Court’s decision </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer, supported by MAG, applied to the Divisional Court for a
    judicial review of the Adjudicator’s order. The Divisional Court identified
    reasonableness as the appropriate standard of review and held that the
    Adjudicator’s decision was reasonable. It noted that even if the standard of
    correctness applied, the decision was also correct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court rejected the submission that compliance with the Adjudicator’s
    order threatened the Children’s Lawyer’s ability to safeguard either solicitor-client
    privilege or her clients’ confidentiality. It endorsed the Adjudicator’s conclusion
    that the Children’s Lawyer’s confidentiality concerns could be addressed
    through the <em>FIPPA</em> exemptions, noting that solicitor-client privilege
    is a specified ground for refusing disclosure under s. 19 of <em>FIPPA</em>.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court similarly rejected the Children’s Lawyer’s submission that
    compliance with the Adjudicator’s order gives rise to an intolerable conflict
    of interest. It held it was reasonable for the Adjudicator to rely on the
    absence of any examples of conflicts over the two decades during which the
    Children’s Lawyer has made access decisions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the Divisional Court concluded that the Adjudicator’s decision was consistent
    with the text and scheme of <em>FIPPA</em>. It held that it was reasonable for
    her to consider the application of s. 10(1) of <em>FIPPA</em> in relation to
    the children’s records; she reasonably considered the custody and control
    factors; and her interpretation promotes the purpose of access to information. </p>
  <p class=Heading>ISSUES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises two issues: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. Did the
    Divisional Court identify the appropriate standard of review? </p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. Did the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties did not agree on the applicable standard of review before the
    Divisional Court and they continue to disagree on appeal. The Children’s Lawyer
    and MAG submit that the Divisional Court should have selected and applied
    correctness; the IPC maintains that the Divisional Court correctly selected
    reasonableness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    considering an appeal from a judicial review, this court must determine whether
    the Divisional Court identified the appropriate standard of review and applied
    it correctly. This requires this court to step into the Divisional Court’s
    shoes and focus on the administrative decision: <em>Agraira v. Canada (Public
    Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</em>, 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559, at
    paras. 45-47.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Identifying
    the appropriate standard of review is a two-step process. <span lang=EN>At the
    first stage, “courts ascertain whether the jurisprudence has already determined
    in a satisfactory manner the degree of deference to be accorded with regard to
    a particular category of question”: </span><em>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</em>,
    2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, at para. 62; and <em>Agraira</em>, at para.
    48. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    it has, the inquiry ends there. However, where the first stage “is<span
lang=EN> unfruitful or if the relevant precedents appear to be inconsistent
    with recent developments in the common law principles of judicial review”,
    courts must “perform a full analysis in order to determine what the applicable
    standard is”: </span><em>Agraira</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em><span
lang=EN>at para. 48; and </span><em>Dunsmuir</em><span lang=EN>, at para. 62. That
    is the case here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the Divisional Court erred in selecting reasonableness as the
    standard of review. As I will explain, the jurisprudence on
    jurisdiction-limiting questions may well have evolved. However, the inquiry does
    not end there. In my view, on a full analysis to determine the applicable
    standard, the appropriate standard remains correctness. The interpretation of “custody
    or control of records” under s. 10(1) of <em>FIPPA</em> as it applies to the Children’s
    Lawyer is a matter of central importance to the legal system as a whole and is
    also outside the decision-maker’s specialized expertise. </p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Correctness
    is the appropriate standard</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer and MAG submit that jurisprudence has already determined that
    correctness applies to the interpretation of custody or control of records
    under s. 10(1) of <em>FIPPA</em>. They rely on this court’s decision in <em>Walmsley
    v. Ontario (Attorney General) </em>(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 611 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Walmsley</em> involved a request for access to records relating to the appointment of a
    provincial court judge. The records at issue were in the personal possession of
    individual members of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee. This court
    held that correctness applied to its review of the IPC’s determination that MAG
    had control over these records, since s. 10(1) of <em>FIPPA </em>was
    jurisdiction limiting and did not require a specialized expertise to interpret.
    Goudge J.A. explained, at p. 618: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Section 10(1)] is a jurisdiction
    limiting one in the sense that records under the control of an institution are
    subject to the workings of the Act…. Records not under the control of an
    institution are not so subject and are beyond the jurisdiction of the
    Commissioner or his designee. Moreover, the test found in s. 10(1), namely “custody
    or control”, is not one requiring a specialized expertise to interpret. By
    contrast, once records are found to be in the control of the institution, the
    applicability of the many legislated exemptions would clearly call on the
    particular expertise of the Commissioner. Finally, the legislation has not seen
    fit to clothe the Commissioner with the protection of any privative clause.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer and MAG also rely on <em>City of Ottawa v. Ontario</em>, 2010
    ONSC 6835, 272 O.A.C. 162 (Div. Ct.), at para. 20, leave to appeal to ONCA
    refused, March 30, 2011 (M39605); and <em>Ontario (Ministry of the Attorney
    General) v. Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner)</em>, 2011 ONSC 172,
    104 O.R. (3d) 588 (Div. Ct.), at paras. 22-24 (“<em>MAG v. IPC</em>”). In both
    decisions, the Divisional Court – relying on <em>Walmsley</em> – applied
    correctness to judicial reviews of the IPC’s interpretation of “in the custody
    or under the control”.    </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    IPC submits that this analysis no longer applies and that true questions of
    jurisdiction are rare. It relies on <em>Alberta (Information and Privacy
    Commissioner) v. Alberta Teachers’ Association</em>, 2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3
    S.C.R. 654, in which the Supreme Court recognized a presumption of reasonableness
    where a court is reviewing a tribunal’s interpretation or application of its
    home statute, and that true questions of jurisdiction are “narrow” and
    “exceptional”: at para. 39. The IPC emphasizes that true questions of
    jurisdiction are now limited to “whether or not the tribunal had the authority
    to make the inquiry”: <em>Quebec (Attorney General) v. Guérin</em>, 2017 SCC
    42, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 32.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court accepted the IPC’s position, stating, at para. 39:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I appreciate that the Court of
    Appeal in <em>Walmsley</em> described s. 10 as “a jurisdiction-limiting”
    provision and acknowledge that this was followed in two subsequent decisions.
    However, these decisions are inconsistent with the specific direction in <em>Dunsmuir</em> that has been repeated and clarified in more recent appellate jurisprudence. This
    jurisprudence supports my conclusion that s. 10 does not raise a true question
    of jurisdiction that would require a correctness standard of review.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Divisional Court that, to the extent they rely on the
    jurisdictional nature of s. 10(1), <em>Walmsley</em> and the cases that
    followed are not in line with recent developments in the common law. In my
    view, however, this analysis does not determine the issue here. I say this for
    two reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the jurisdictional nature of s. 10(1) was not the only basis earlier decisions
    identified for applying correctness. <em>Walmsley</em>, <em>City of Ottawa</em> and <em>MAG v. IPC</em> all determined that the test for custody or control was
    outside the specialized expertise of the decision-maker. Moreover, in <em>City
    of Ottawa</em> the Divisional Court determined that whether freedom of
    information legislation applied to documents in question – in that case
    government employees’ personal workplace emails – was “a legal question of
    broad significance for thousands of individuals across the province, going well
    beyond the interests of the particular parties before the court”: at para. 20. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    aspects of these decisions have not been changed by subsequent jurisprudence. <em>Walmsley</em>, <em>City of Ottawa</em> and <em>MAG v. IPC</em> have, therefore, satisfactorily
    determined that correctness applies in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    even if these decisions have not satisfactorily determined the standard of
    review, the nature of the question at issue attracts correctness under the
    second stage of the standard of review analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    unique role of the Children’s Lawyer is fundamental to the proper functioning
    of the legal system. It is thus reviewable on the standard of correctness as
    per <em>Dunsmuir</em>,<em> </em>at para 60:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[C]ourts must also continue to
    substitute their own view of the correct answer where the question at issue is
    one of general law “that is both of central importance to the legal system as a
    whole and outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise”. Because of
    their impact on the administration of justice as a whole, such questions
    require uniform and consistent answers. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Matters
    fundamental to the functioning of our legal system remain subject to a
    correctness standard of review post-<em>Dunsmuir</em>. <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>In </span></em><em>Alberta (Information and Privacy
    Commissioner) v. University of Calgary</em>, 2016 SCC 53, [2016] 2 SCR 555 (“<em>Alberta
    v. UC</em>”), the majority of the Supreme Court applied correctness to the
    interpretation of freedom of information legislation where it might impact
    solicitor-client privilege. <em>Alberta v. UC</em> involved a judicial review
    of a decision pursuant to Alberta’s <em>Freedom of Information and Protection
    of Privacy Act</em>, R.S.A. 2000, c. F-25 (“<em>FOIPP</em>”). The central issue
    was whether <em>FOIPP</em> allowed the Information and Privacy Commissioner of
    Alberta (the “Commissioner”) and her delegates to review documents over which
    solicitor-client privilege is claimed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Coté
    J., writing for the majority, held that whether <em>FOIPP</em> allows

    to the legal system as a whole. She explained, at para. 20: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>As this Court said
    in </span><em>Blood Tribe</em><span lang=EN>, solicitor-client privilege is “<u>fundamental

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span

class=Underline>concerned with the protection of a relationship that has a
    central importance to the legal system as a whole</span><span lang=EN>”

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Coté
    J. also held that the issue was outside the Commissioner’s specialized area of
    expertise. She stated, at para. 22: “<span lang=EN>[T]here is nothing to
    suggest that the Commissioner has particular expertise with respect to
    solicitor-client privilege, an issue which has traditionally been adjudicated
    by courts”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Coté
    J.’s comments in <em>Alberta v. UC</em> aptly apply to this case. The
    protection of the relationship between the Children’s Lawyer and her child
    clients is of central importance to the legal system as a whole. It is a relationship
    based on confidentiality that extends beyond solicitor-client privilege and
    requires a <em>heightened</em> degree of protection by the courts. As I will
    explain, the <em>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</em>,
    Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3 (the “<em>Convention</em>”), to which Canada is a
    signatory, requires that children be afforded special safeguards, care and legal
    protection by the courts on all matters involving their best interests,
    including privacy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
    solicitor-client privilege, the confidential relationship between the
    Children’s Lawyer and children is “<span lang=EN>fundamental to the proper
    functioning of our legal system” and the protection of that relationship “has a
    central importance to the legal system as a whole”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the role of the Children’s Lawyer is fundamental to the proper
    functioning of our system of justice; the issue is outside the Adjudicator’s
    specialized area of expertise; and the standard of correctness with respect to
    the protection of a relationship that has central importance to the legal
    system has already been adjudicated. Therefore, correctness is the appropriate
    standard. </p>
  <h2>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was

    court undertaking a correctness review will “undertake its own analysis of the
    question” and “decide whether it agrees with the determination of the decision
    maker”. If it does not, “the court will substitute its own view and provide the
    correct answer”: <em>Dunsmuir</em>, at para. 50. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    applying this standard, I begin by situating the issue on appeal within a
    context, namely: the best interests of the child; the voice of the child; the
    confidential role of the Children’s Lawyer; the child’s privacy interests; the
    fact that confidentiality is broader than solicitor-client privilege; and the
    fact that the records belong to the child. I then apply the context to the
    relationship between the Children’s Lawyer and MAG to demonstrate that with
    respect to her core functions of representing children, the Children’s Lawyer
    cannot be a “branch” of MAG as determined by the Adjudicator.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    determine that the Adjudicator <em>started </em>from the assumption that the
    Children’s Lawyer is a “branch” or “part of” MAG, and thus MAG had custody or
    control of the records. In so doing, she failed to give appropriate weight to
    the Children’s Lawyer’s role and responsibilities. She did not address the
    impact of her decision on the best interests of the child who is entitled to
    heightened protections within the law. Nor did she consider the importance of
    the relationship on the administration of justice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that, given the relevant context, the Children’s Lawyer does and must
    operate separately and distinctly from MAG. When representing children, her
    office is therefore not a branch of MAG. The Adjudicator was required to
    analyze whether records held by the Children’s Lawyer – as not part of an
    institution under <em>FIPPA</em> – are in MAG’s custody or control. She failed
    to do so. Upon undertaking this analysis, I determine that MAG does not have
    custody or control of the requested records. </p>

    contextual approach to statutory interpretation and judicial review. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the statutes at issue in this appeal, including <em>FIPPA</em> itself,
    must be viewed through this lens and interpreted in a way that gives primacy to
    the best interests of the child. The Adjudicator, and the Divisional Court on
    judicial review, failed to consider the best interests of the child – who is at
    the center of the issue before this court now. The results of the Adjudicator’s
    order would impact the child’s voice in the judicial system and the child’s
    privacy rights. Further, the family law courts would lose the benefit of
    important information provided by children, affecting decisions for families
    throughout the province.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    correct interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions at issue requires
    close attention to the interests and needs of children. </p>
  <h6><b>The voice of the child</b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    classic family law custody dispute gave rise to the Children’s Lawyer’s
    involvement in this case. Over the past several years, courts have taken great
    initiative to seek out and consider the views and preferences of the child.
    Professors Birnbaum and Bala explain:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The movement towards child
    inclusion in decision-making in education, medical treatment, and various areas
    of the law, including separation and divorce, has grown over the last decade.
    Studies have explored children’s rights as citizens, children’s perspectives on
    family relationships and what is a family, and children’s attitudes about parental
    separation and participation in the decision-making process about
    post-separation parenting. Research clearly suggests that children’s inclusion
    in the post-separation decision-making process is important to the promotion of
    their well-being. [Footnotes omitted.]<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    art. 12 of the <em>Convention </em>requires that: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>States Parties shall assure to the
    child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those
    views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given
    due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>For this purpose, the child shall
    in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and
    administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a
    representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the
    procedural rules of national law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Children
    are among the most vulnerable members of society. Courts, administrative
    authorities and legislative bodies have a duty to recognize, advance and
    protect their interests. When children are the subject of a custody dispute or
    child protection proceedings, they are at their most vulnerable. Exposure to
    conflict has been called the “single most damaging factor for children in the
    face of divorce”: per Backhouse J., in <em>Graham v. Bruto</em>, [2007] O.J.
    No. 656 (S.C.), at para. 65, aff’d 2008 ONCA 260. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It
    has always been a challenge for family law courts to find a way for children to
    express their views without exposing them to further trauma or causing more
    damage to the family. Those who work in the family law system are all too aware
    that children remain part of the family long after a judicial decision is
    reached. The process of determining the child’s true wishes and preferences
    requires delicacy, for to undertake the process without expertise may further
    hurt the child and fracture family relationships.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer has been recognized as a model for addressing this challenge.
    The Honourable Donna J. Martinson and Caterina E. Tempesta, wrote that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In Canada, the most expansive
    child representation program is offered by the Office of the Children’s
    Lawyer…[it] may serve as a model for other jurisdictions in promoting access to
    justice for children by ensuring that their views are heard in court processes.<a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the judges involved in the underlying custody dispute sought the
    Children’s Lawyer’s involvement in the matter. </p>
  <h6><b>The Children’s Lawyer’s role: a confidential relationship with the child </b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer is an independent statutory office holder appointed by
    Cabinet through the Lieutenant Governor. She derives her independent powers,
    duties and responsibilities through statute, common law and orders of the
    court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her
    fiduciary duties to the child require undivided loyalty, good faith and
    attention to the child’s interests, to the exclusion of other interests,
    including the interests of the child’s parents, the interest of the Crown and
    the interests of MAG. As stated by Abella J., as she then was, in <em>Re W.</em> (1980),<em> </em>27 O.R. (2d) 314 (Prov. Ct.), at p. 317, the Children’s Lawyer
    has an obligation to ensure that the views expressed by the child are freely
    given without duress. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer not only represents the child’s interests; she provides a
    safe, effective way for the child’s voice to be heard. For her to do this, she
    must provide a promise of confidentiality. Children must be able to disclose
    feelings and facts to the Children’s Lawyer that cannot or will not be communicated
    to parents. Children’s interests can be averse to that of their parents. Feelings
    of guilt and betrayal that may influence a child require a safe person to speak
    to.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is difficult enough for children to be the subject of litigation. For their voices
    to be heard, they must be guaranteed confidentiality when they say, “please,
    don’t tell my mom”, or “please, don’t tell my dad”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    allow a disgruntled parent to obtain confidential records belonging to the
    child would undermine the Children’s Lawyer’s promise of confidentiality,
    inhibit the information she could obtain and sabotage her in the exercise of
    her duties. This would, in turn, impact proceedings before the court by
    depriving it of the child’s voice and cause damage to the child who would no
    longer be meaningfully represented. Finally, disclosure to a parent could cause
    further trauma and stress to the child, who may have divided loyalties, exposing
    the child to retribution and making the child the problem in the litigation. </p>
  <h6><b>The child’s privacy interests</b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    child has significant privacy interests in the information disclosed to the
    Children’s Lawyer. The child’s privacy rights, as with her other rights, are
    entitled to more, not less protection. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preamble to the <em>Convention </em>directs that special safeguards and care,
    including legal protection, be afforded to children. The preamble states:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Bearing in mind that, as indicated
    in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, “the child, by reason of his
    physical and mental immaturity, <u>needs special safeguards and care, including
    appropriate legal protection</u>, before as well as after birth”[.] [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk507152520">[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These special safeguards include “[t]o have his or her privacy fully
    respected at all stages of the proceedings”: <em>Convention</em>, art.
    40(2)(b)(vii).</a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    explained above, to allow a parent to have access to a child’s records would
    negatively impact the child’s privacy interests. <a name="_Hlk506992342"></a></p>
  <h6><b>Confidentiality is broader than solicitor-client privilege</b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Adjudicator concluded that the Children’s Lawyer’s “<span lang=EN>confidentiality
    concerns … can be addressed by exemptions under the applicable access to
    information legislation.”</span> In doing so, she conflated solicitor-client
    privilege with confidentiality. The former is caught by the exemption at s. 19
    of <em>FIPPA</em>, the latter is not. And yet, it is the latter that gives rise
    to the most sensitive information about the child, and which is deserving of
    special protection. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Information
    may be confidential without being privileged. As the British Columbia Court of
    Appeal explained in <em>British Columbia (Securities Commission) v. B.D.S</em>.,
    2003 BCCA 244, 13 B.C.L.R. (4th) 107, at para 45:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is no doubt that lawyers are
    under an obligation to keep confidential all documents and other communications
    made to them by their clients, but not all such communications are subject to
    solicitor-client privilege and a claim of privilege does not convert non-privileged
    documents into privileged documents. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer gathers information from and about her child clients in
    numerous ways: with assistance from social workers; through therapists, school
    teachers; and so on. This information is necessary for the Children’s Lawyer to
    properly represent the child. It is crucial in order for the child’s voice to
    be heard.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Mesbur J. explained in <em>Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Toronto v. S.S.B.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2013 ONSC 4560, 35 R.F.L. (7th) 178, at
    para. 21: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>When [the Children’s Lawyer] takes
    a position on behalf of a child, child’s counsel will ascertain the child’s
    views and preferences. In doing so, it will consider the independence, strength
    and consistency of the child's views and preferences; the circumstances
    surrounding those views and preferences, and all other relevant evidence about
    the child’s interests. It is in this context the [Children’s Lawyer] relies on
    a clinical investigator to assist counsel in determining those views and
    preferences so that it can advocate a position on behalf of the child.
    Essentially, the clinical investigator assists counsel in ascertaining its client’s
    reasonable instructions; that is, the position to be taken on behalf of the
    child. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    some records may be subject to the solicitor-client exemption, others may not. These
    include the child’s views expressed to teachers, counsellors, therapists, friends,
    and parents of friends. Yet, the Children’s Lawyer’s duty of confidentiality
    applies to all records. </p>
  <h6><b>The records belong to the child</b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    records in question here belong to the child. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decisions below were incorrect to rely on <em>Ontario (Children’s Lawyer) v. Ontario
    (Information and Privacy Commissioner) </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(2003), </span></em>66 O.R. (3d) 692 (Div. Ct.) (“<em>Children’s Lawyer</em>”), aff’d
    (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 309 (C.A.). In that case, the Divisional Court considered a
    judicial review from a request by an adult whom the Children’s Lawyer
    represented as a child for her files held by the Children’s Lawyer. Oddly, the
    request was made pursuant to <em>FIPPA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> rather than as a request from a client for her own files. The Divisional Court upheld
    an IPC decision ordering the Children’s Lawyer to disclose most of the requested
    documents. The Children’s Lawyer appealed only with respect to whether the IPC
    had standing before the Divisional Court. This court dismissed the appeal, but
    Goudge J.A. commented as follows, at para. 5:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Upon reaching
    majority and apparently dissatisfied with her representation, Jane Doe
    requested a copy of her “complete files”. The Children’s Lawyer, whose office
    operates as a branch of the Ministry of the Attorney General, treated this as a
    request for information under </span>FIPPA<em> </em><span lang=EN>rather than
    as a request from a client for her file. However reasonable it might be to
    analyze the interests at stake in this framework, this was not raised as an
    issue before us, and I will say nothing more about it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of whether the Children’s Lawyer is a branch of MAG was not argued before,
    or addressed by either court. Nor was the issue of whether the files belonged
    to the client and thus the application was unnecessary. For these reasons, <em>Children’s
    Lawyer</em> does not determine the issue here: whether a third party can have
    access to a child’s records through <em>FIPPA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interestingly,
    in <em>Children’s Lawyer</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>the Divisional Court refers to the fiduciary duties the Children’s Lawyer owed
    the child. At para. 83, the court endorses the IPC’s description of the
    fiduciary nature of the Children’s Lawyer as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The [Children’s Lawyer] meets the
    criteria for the imposition of fiduciary duties, apart from doing so on the
    basis of the solicitor and client relationship…. It has the classic indicia of
    a fiduciary relationship: the scope for the exercise of discretion or power;
    the opportunity to exercise that power unilaterally so as to affect the minor’s
    legal or practical interests; a peculiar vulnerability due to the minority
    status of the client; and an expectation that the [Children’s Lawyer] will be
    concerned with the minor’s interests and not its own.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here
    the Adjudicator dismissed the Children’s Lawyer’s submission as to the child
    client’s ownership of the files. She found: “<span lang=EN>[T]his argument
    overreaches”. This conclusion is flawed for two reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>First, it ignores the heightened privacy rights of children. As the
    Supreme Court observed in </span><em>A.B. v. Bragg Communications Inc.</em>,
    2012 SCC 46, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 567, at para 17<span lang=EN>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Recognition of the <em>inherent</em> vulnerability of children has consistent and deep roots in Canadian law. This
    results in protection for young people’s privacy under [various statutes], not
    to mention international protections such as the <em>Convention on the Rights
    of the Child</em>… The law attributes the heightened vulnerability based on
    chronology, not temperament [.] [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only way that the role of the Children’s Lawyer differs from that of a
    conventional solicitor-client relationship is that the child is entitled to a <span
class=Underline>heightened </span>protection of confidentiality as mandated by
    the <em>Convention. </em>As stated by Mesbur J. in <em>S.S.B.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 32: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>A child-client’s
    right to a confidential relationship with counsel must be guarded with more
    vigilance than that accorded to an adult client, not with less.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>Second, it is premised on the erroneous notion that children cannot
    represent themselves in court. </span>The Adjudicator stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The existence of the [Children’s
    Lawyer] is premised in part on the fact that children cannot represent
    themselves or retain counsel without a litigation guardian, as they are under
    the legal disability of childhood.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She continued:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Even with respect to child
    protection cases, the role of the Children’s Lawyer as legal representative … differs
    from a conventional solicitor-client relationship[.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    premise is wrong. Children can represent themselves without a litigation
    guardian and do so regularly in family proceedings. They are not always under a
    legal disability. For example, the <em>Children’s Law Reform Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C. 12, specifically provides, at s. 63(1), that “[a] minor who is a
    parent may make an application under this Part [Custody, Access and
    Guardianship] without a next friend and may respond without a litigation
    guardian”.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    this context, I turn to the question of whether MAG has custody or control of
    the records of the Children’s Lawyer.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the context to custody or control</p>
  <h6><b>The Children’s Lawyer is separate and distinct from MAG</b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Adjudicator erred when she started from the assumption that the Children’s
    Lawyer was a branch of MAG. She stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>There is no dispute that [</span><em>FIPPA</em><span
lang=EN>]</span><a href="https://qweri.lexum.com/onlegis/rso-1990-c-f31-en"
target="_blank"></a> <span lang=EN>applies to “institutions”, which are defined
    to include provincial ministries. The overriding considerations in this case
    are:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>• the undisputed fact
    that the [Children’s Lawyer] is a branch of the ministry and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>• all of the records
    at issue were generated in the course of the [Children’s Lawyer] fulfilling its
    core mandate.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Despite these
    considerations, a consistent theme of the [Children’s Lawyer’s] submissions is
    an effort to differentiate the [Children’s Lawyer], together with its mandate
    as a branch within [MAG], from [MAG] itself. For the reasons set out below, I
    find this approach flawed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>It is not “undisputed” that the Children’s Lawyer is a branch of MAG. </span>The
    Adjudicator based her determination on the <em>Children’s Lawyer </em>decision.
    However, as discussed, that issue was not argued or addressed in <em>Children’s
    Lawyer</em> for it was irrelevant to the outcome of the case.<em> </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    starting from the assumption that the Children’s Lawyer is a branch of MAG, the
    Adjudicator did not take into account the context in which the Children’s
    Lawyer must operate, separate and distinct from MAG. Instead, she used the
    concept of a “branch” to cloak MAG with control over the Children’s Lawyer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    MAG is an institution within the meaning of s. 2(1) of <em>FIPPA</em>, bodies
    that may be administratively structured under MAG are not automatically subject
    to <em>FIPPA</em>. An organization’s administrative structure is not
    determinative of custody or control; a contextual analysis is required. In <em>Walmsley</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> this court explained that a
    determination of care or control “depends on an examination of all aspects of
    the relationship between [here the Children’s Lawyer] and [MAG] that are
    relevant to control over the documents”: at p. 619.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    examination of the relationship between the Children’s Lawyer and MAG relevant
    to custody or control over the documents discloses that – for her core
    functions regarding children – the Children’s Lawyer is not a branch of MAG. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Children’s Lawyer represents the child. She is not a government agent. Her
    functions and promise of confidentiality are not conferred on MAG. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Children’s Lawyer is administratively structured under and has a funding
    relationship with MAG, they are not connected with respect to her core
    functions: there is no statutory relationship between the two entities; she
    does not receive direction from MAG; she does not report to MAG; and her
    fiduciary duties are to her child clients, not to MAG.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Children’s
    Lawyer’s fiduciary duties to her child clients require undivided loyalty, good
    faith and attention to the child’s interests, to the exclusion of other
    interests, including the interests of the child’s parents, the interest of the
    Crown and the interests of MAG. The independence of the Children’s Lawyer is
    particularly significant when she must act contrary to the interests of MAG or
    the Crown. Her child clients could have an action against the Crown, could have
    a constitutional question before the court, or could be a defendant in an
    action brought by the Crown. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    representing children, the Children’s Lawyer operates separate and apart from
    MAG, does not take direction or obtain input from MAG, does not provide MAG
    with access to records relating to children and MAG does not have authority to
    request them. The Children’s Lawyer is solely responsible for record keeping in
    relation to her clients without any direction from MAG. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Children’s
    Lawyer is not a branch of MAG for the purposes of the children’s records. Again,
    an organization’s administrative structure is not determinative of custody or

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>In </span></em><em>Fontaine v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>2016
    ONCA 241, 130 O.R. (3d) 1, aff’d 2017 SCC 47, 414 D.L.R. (4th) 577, this court
    affirmed that the existence of an administrative relationship between two
    government entities does not necessarily make them one for the purposes of
    access to information legislation. <em>Fontaine</em> concerned the fate of
    records generated by the Indian Residential Schools Agreement and the
    Independent Assessment Process (the “IAP”), which were operated within
    Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (“AANDC”). Strathy C.J.O. commented
    on the nature of the records, at para. 179:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Were the head of AANDC to receive
    an access to information request … it would have no reasonable legal or
    practical expectation that it could obtain copies of such IAP Documents from
    the Secretariat … That may not be the case for documents of a different nature,
    such as those relating to funding, auditing, and human resources - documents
    for which AANDC would have a much stronger claim for control. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court
    ultimately concluded that the Secretariat of the IAP, an “autonomous branch” of
    AANDC, “retains possession of the documents provided to and generated by the
    IAP”: at para. 174. It held that IAP documents in the Secretariat’s possession
    “are simply not under the control of AANDC”: at para. 180. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court distinguished <em>Fontaine</em> on the basis that the Secretariat had
    decision-making functions, akin to that of a court. That fact, in my view, does
    not alter the rule that an administrative relationship does not determine
    custody or control.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other cases have
    similarly held that an administrative relationship with a designated
    institution does not amount to custody or control for freedom of information
    legislation<em><span style='font-style:normal'>. For example, the following
    have been held not be in an institution’s custody or control</span></em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>a) Records of the members of the
    Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee, which was set up by the Attorney
    General;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[5]</span></sup></sup></a> </p>
  <p class=CQuote>b) Personal emails of a city
    employee on his government email account;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[6]</span></sup></sup></a> and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>c) Records held within Ministers’ offices under their
    respective Ministries, except in defined circumstances.<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[7]</span></sup></sup></a></p>
  <h6><b>The records are not within MAG’s custody or control</b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the Children’s
    Lawyer is not part of MAG, and is thus not an institution, an analysis is
    required to determine whether the records are under MAG’s custody or control. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Minister
    of National Defence</em> the Supreme Court articulated a two-part test for whether
    records held by bodies that are not part of an institution are under the
    institution’s control and thus subject to freedom of information requests:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1.       Do the contents of a document
    relate to a departmental matter?</p>
  <p class=CQuote><a name="_Hlk507600828">2.       Could
    the government institution reasonably expect to obtain a copy of the document
    upon request? </a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charron J. noted,
    at paras. 55-56:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Step one of the test acts as a
    useful screening device. It asks whether the record relates to a departmental
    matter. If it does not, that indeed ends the inquiry….</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Under step two, <em>all</em> relevant factors must be considered in order to determine whether the government
    institution could reasonably expect to obtain a copy upon request. [Emphasis in
    original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Adjudicator referred to the two-part test from <em>Minister of National Defence</em>,
    but determined that: “Accepting that the [Children’s Lawyer] is a branch of
    [MAG], it would be redundant to ask whether the [Children’s Lawyer] ‘could
    reasonably be expected’ to obtain the records at issue.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Adjudicator’s reasoning is flawed for several reasons. First, it is circular,
    for it starts from the premise that the Children’s Lawyer is part of MAG when
    the object of the exercise is to determine whether MAG has custody or control
    of the records of another organization. Second, it analyzes whether the Children’s
    Lawyer has control of the records, when what is required under the test is that
    MAG has control. There was no issue but that the Children’s Lawyer had control.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the relevant
    test is applied to the child’s records with the Children’s Lawyer, it is clear
    that MAG does not have control of the records:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Step one: Do the contents of
    the requested records relate to a departmental matter</em>? </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The answer must be no. MAG plays no
    part in the records of the Children’s Lawyer. The records do not relate to a
    departmental matter; MAG has nothing to do with the Children’s Lawyer’s work.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Step two: Could MAG reasonably
    expect to obtain a copy of the records upon request? </em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Again the answer – for the reasons
    set out above – is no. Neither MAG officials nor the Attorney General could
    reasonably expect to obtain a copy of the requested records.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Divisional
    Court in <em>City of Ottawa</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, at para.
    30,</span></em> cited approvingly ten questions former Commissioner Sidney
    Linden outlined in IPC <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Order 120</span></em> to be asked when determining whether an institution has custody or control of
    records. Although the Adjudicator referred to some of these questions, she
    failed to situate her analysis within the context of the Children’s Lawyer’s
    work. I address these ten questions and provide answers based on the context I
    have set out: </p>
  <h2><em>1) Was the record
    created by an officer or employee of the institution?  </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Here, the records at issue were created by legal agents of the
    Children’</span>s Lawyer<span lang=EN-US> (who is appointed by the court pursuant
    to the </span><em>CJA </em><span lang=EN-US>to exercise independent statutory
    functions) while providing legal representation to children. The records were
    not created for or on behalf of MAG. The Children’s Lawyer’s role precludes it
    from acting in the interest of MAG or the Crown in these matters. </span></p>
  <h2><em>2) What use did the
    creator intend to make of the record? </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The records were intended solely for use in litigation on behalf of
    child clients in custody and access proceedings as ordered by the court. The
    records were not created for MAG’s use or on behalf of the Crown.</span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;'><em>3) Does the
    institution have possession of the record?</em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>MAG does not have possession of the records. They are exclusively
    held by the Children’s Lawyer in her legal file.</span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;'><em>4) If the
    institution does not have possession of the record, is it being held by an
    officer or employee of the institution for the purposes of his or her duties as
    an officer or employee? </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The records are being held by the Children’s Lawyer for the purposes
    of her independent statutory, legal and fiduciary duties to children, and not
    as an agent of MAG. </span></p>
  <h2><em>5) Does the institution
    have a right to possession of the record?   </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>MAG has no statutory or other right to possess the records. The Children’s
    Lawyer does not allow MAG officials to access or possess these records. Allowing
    MAG to have access to, or possession of, the records would violate the
    Children’s Lawyer’s duty to maintain the confidentiality of her child clients’
    records.</span></p>
  <h2><em>6) Does the content of the
    record relate to the institution’s mandate and functions? </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The contents do not relate to MAG’s mandate or functions. The
    contents of the records relate to the Children’</span>s Lawyer<span lang=EN-US>’s
    independent statutory functions in providing legal representation to children
    in custody and access proceedings. The records relate to litigation where the Children’s
    Lawyer is acting, at the request of the court, independently from MAG in
    representing child clients who are subjects of custody and access proceedings.
    These functions are statutorily conferred exclusively on the Children’s Lawyer,
    and not on MAG or the Attorney General.  </span></p>
  <h2><em>7) Does the institution
    have the authority to regulate the record’s use? </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>MAG has no authority to regulate the use of the records. The
    regulation of the use of these records is within the exclusive authority of the
    Children’</span>s Lawyer in accordance with her professional obligations to her
    child clients. The Children<span lang=EN-US>’s Lawyer uses these records for
    the sole purpose of representing the interests of her child clients. </span></p>
  <h2><em>8) To what extent has
    the record been relied upon by the institution? </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>MAG has never relied on, or had possession of, these records. The
    records have only been relied on by the Children’s Lawyer in order to represent
    the interests of its child clients in litigation. </span></p>
  <h2><em>9) How closely has the record
    been integrated with the other records held by the institution? </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>These records have never been integrated with MAG records. The
    Children’s Lawyer’s files related to legal services provided to children are
    kept separately from any MAG records. No official or employee outside of the Children’s
    Lawyer has access to these records.</span></p>
  <h2><em>10) Does the institution
    have the authority to dispose of the record? </em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The records are maintained and disposed of in accordance with a
    records policy established by the Children’s Lawyer in 2006. The Children’s
    Lawyer does not obtain MAG approval or direction related to its child client
    records or on its internal policies related to these files. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The IPC alleges that because in the past MAG has forwarded </span><em>FIPPA</em><span
lang=EN> requests relating to the Children’s Lawyer records to the Children’s
    Lawyer for response, it must continue to do so. First, past practice is not
    determinative. As stated by Charron J. in </span><em>Minister of National
    Defense</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em><span
lang=EN>at para. 56:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[A]ny expectation to
    obtain a copy of the record cannot be based on “past practices and prevalent
    expectations” that bear no relationship on the nature and contents of the
    record, [or] on the actual legal relationship between the government
    institution and the record holder…</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Second, the evolving nature of the functions of the Children’s Lawyer with
    respect to advancing children’s interests and the voice of the child,
    particularly in light of the </span><em>Convention</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span lang=EN> requires new scrutiny. </span></p>
  <h6><b>The Adjudicator’s order does not promote the purposes of FIPPA</b></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The IPC submits
    that the Adjudicator’s order is consistent with the purpose and the scheme of <em>FIPPA</em>.
    I do not agree.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purposes of <em>FIPPA </em>include providing access to “government information” and protecting the
    privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves.
    Subjecting the Children’s Lawyer’s records to this regime does not accomplish
    either goal. Children’s records do not contain information that could be
    described as “government information”, nor do they contain any information that
    would advance the goals of government accountability and transparency. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>On the contrary, providing third parties with access to a child’s
    records would seriously undermine the Children’s Lawyer in her role as advocate
    for the child. It would also sabotage the child’s heightened privacy rights,
    eviscerate the work of the Children’s Lawyer and seriously limit the court’s
    ability to fully address the child’s best interests. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the most
    significant developments in family litigation affecting children is the
    recognition that the child has a voice. The Adjudicator’s decision would muzzle
    that voice, undermine the court process and go against the best interests of
    the child.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these
    reasons, I would allow the appeal and quash the Adjudicator’s order. In
    accordance with the parties’ agreement, I would not order costs. </p>
