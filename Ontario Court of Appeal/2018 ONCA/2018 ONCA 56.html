  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, a cocaine dealer, was arrested in possession of a fully-
    loaded, operable, semi-automatic Ruger pistol, a quantity of cocaine, and
    considerable cash. He was charged with, and eventually convicted after a trial
    by judge alone of several firearm and drug-related offences. The trial judge
    imposed sentences totalling five years. The appellant appeals conviction only. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s factual guilt was never in issue. He argued, however,
    that the police violated his constitutional rights to be free from arbitrary
    detention and unreasonable search in the events immediately preceding his
    arrest and the seizure of the gun, cocaine, and cash. The appellant argued that
    all of the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The trial judge found that the police had not violated the
    appellant’s <em>Charter</em> rights and that if there was any <em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> violation, the appellant had not made out a case for
    excluding the evidence seized under s. 24(2).</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

style='font-style:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The central events
    occurred in the backyard of the townhouse unit where Leraldo Dixon lived with
    his mother. Mr. Dixon and four of his friends, one of whom was the appellant,
    were sitting in the backyard talking when three police officers arrived. Less
    than a minute later, the appellant bolted from the backyard with the officers
    in pursuit. He was apprehended a short distance away. At the time of his
    arrest, he was carrying a loaded handgun, cocaine, and a considerable amount of
    cash.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The trial judge heard
    evidence over several days from the three police officers involved in the
    relevant events, a private security guard who spoke with the officers, the
    appellant, and his four friends who were present with him in the backyard. There
    were some significant differences in the versions of events described by the various
    witnesses. To make the necessary factual findings, the trial judge had to
    evaluate the witnesses’ credibility. He found that the police officers were
    credible, the appellant was a liar, and some parts of the evidence of the other
    four young men were inaccurate. The trial judge gave reasons for his
    credibility findings, all of which are grounded in the evidence. Having made those
    assessments, the trial judge moved to his factual findings. As is inevitably
    the case, those factual findings played a crucial role in the trial judge’s evaluation
    of the appellant’s </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'> claims. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>This court approaches a
    trial judge’s credibility assessments and findings of fact with deference. It
    is incumbent upon the appellant to demonstrate that the findings are tainted by
    some legal error, flow from a material misapprehension of the evidence, or fall
    outside of the range of reasonableness available on the evidence: see </span></em><em>R.
    v. Mann</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R.
    59, at para. 49.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her factum, counsel for the appellant does not challenge the trial judge's credibility assessments. She does take issue with two or three specific factual findings. I will not detail those arguments. On my review of the evidence, the appellant's arguments go no further than to suggest another interpretation of certain features of the evidence. Even if that interpretation was available, it does not demonstrate the unreasonableness of the different interpretation made by the trial judge. I approach the appellant's arguments on the basis that the trial judge's credibility assessments and findings of fact
    stand. </p>
  <p class=MHeading12><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not propose to review the evidence at length. The trial judge’s reasons are
    lucid, detailed, and include an accurate and comprehensive review of the
    evidence. For a thorough review and analysis of the evidence, especially as it
    relates to the police officers’ actions, one should read the trial judge’s reasons.
    For convenience, the trial judge’s reasons are reproduced as <a
href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2014/2014onsc2033/2014onsc2033.html">'Schedule
    A'</a> to these reasons. I will summarize the evidence only to the extent
    necessary to address the grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    Teatero was on duty on the evening of May 25, 2012. He was at the Atkinson
    Housing Co-operative, a complex of townhouses located in the west part of
    Toronto. Constable Teatero was speaking with two security guards who were
    responsible for overall security at the housing complex, and general crime
    prevention in the area. Constable Teatero was joined by Constables Reid and
    O’Toole who were on duty together that night. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    residents of the Atkinson Housing Co-operative were plagued by a very high
    level of violent crime, most of which was associated with gangs, guns, and
    drugs. The officers were aware of this history.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers were looking for two people wanted by the police and known to be
    involved in violent crimes in the area of the housing complex. The security
    officers indicated that they had not seen one of the two, but that the other hung
    around an area of the complex behind the townhouse located at 84 Vanauley Walk.
    The security guards described that area as a “problem area” associated with
    drugs and other criminal activities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    speaking to the security officers, the police decided to walk through the
    townhouse complex to the area that the security guards had identified. The three
    officers walked along a paved footpath that travelled through the complex. The
    footpath stopped at a walkway that led into the backyard at 84 Vanauley Walk. The
    backyard was surrounded by a waist-high wooden fence. There was an opening in
    the fence where the walkway was. There was no gate.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers saw five young men, one of whom was the appellant, sitting in the
    backyard talking. According to the police, the young men were simply talking
    and not doing anything wrong. The officers did not recognize any of the young
    men. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constables
    Teatero and Reid walked through the gateway into the backyard. Neither officer
    asked permission to enter the backyard or said anything to the young men before
    entering. Constable Teatero addressed the group cordially, asking, “How are you
    guys doing?” He asked if any of them lived in the townhouse at 84 Vanauley
    Walk. On the trial judge’s factual findings, the appellant said he did not live
    in the townhouse and there was no audible response from Mr. Dixon, who lived in
    the townhouse with his mother. Also, on the trial judge’s factual findings, no
    one objected to the police presence in the backyard.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    Reid then spoke directly to Mr. Dixon who was seated on a couch in the
    backyard. Mr. Dixon told Constable Reid that he lived in the townhouse with his
    mother. Mr. Dixon produced identification. On the trial judge’s finding, Mr.
    Dixon did not suggest to the officer that he should not be in the backyard or
    that he should leave. Constable Teatero spoke with another young man sitting on
    the couch.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    O’Toole entered the backyard shortly after the other two officers. At one
    point, he saw one of the men on the couch put his hands behind his back, and he
    told the man to keep his hands in front of him. Constable O’Toole approached
    the appellant and a second young man who were standing on the patio of the
    backyard. The patio was closer to the back door of the townhouse than the couch
    on which Mr. Dixon was seated. Constable O’Toole asked the person with the
    appellant for identification. That person produced his identification.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Constable O’Toole was holding the young man’s identification, he turned to the
    appellant and asked him for identification. The appellant responded that he did
    not have any on him. The appellant looked nervous to Constable O’Toole. Constable
    O’Toole noticed that the appellant had a bag slung over his shoulder sitting on
    his hip. The appellant appeared to be “blading” his body. Blading is a term
    used by the police to describe a body movement whereby a person attempts to
    position himself so that an officer cannot see an object sitting on the
    person’s hip. The police are trained to associate this manoeuver with
    possession of a firearm. Constable Teatero also noticed the appellant
    “blading”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    O’Toole became concerned that the appellant might have a weapon. He asked, “What’s
    in the bag?” The appellant immediately fled. Constable O’Toole, quickly joined
    by the other two officers, gave chase. The three officers had been in the Dixon
    backyard for less than a minute when the appellant fled. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    O’Toole caught up to the appellant a short distance away and tackled him. An
    “all-out fight” followed. During the struggle, Constable O’Toole became aware
    that the appellant had a pistol in his bag and was trying to reach for it. The
    fight intensified. The other two officers arrived at the struggle and together
    they subdued the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    search at the scene of the arrest and a subsequent search at the police station

    appellant argues that the police were unlawfully in the Dixon backyard when
    they spoke with the appellant and that their unlawful entry into, and presence
    in, the backyard constitutes interference with his reasonable expectation of
    privacy. The appellant completes the argument with the contention that because
    the police presence was unlawful, it cannot be said to be a reasonable
    intrusion upon his reasonable expectation of privacy.<a href="#_ftn1"

    succeed on this ground, the appellant must demonstrate, both that the police
    unlawfully entered the backyard and that their unlawful entry interfered with his
    reasonable expectation of privacy. The appellant was in the backyard at the
    invitation of his friend, Mr. Dixon, when the police entered. He contends that
    his status as an invited guest present on the property gave him a reasonable
    expectation of privacy in respect of entry onto the property by the police. </p>

    property at some length (paras. 66-80). He concluded that the police were
    entitled to enter the backyard and speak to the persons in the backyard under
    the common law “implied licence” doctrine: see <em>Robson v. Hallett</em>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge said, at para. 70:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the circumstances of the present case, the police officers
    clearly had a lawful reason to enter the backyard property and speak to the
    occupier. They were pursuing an investigation of a wanted man who, they had
    been told, frequented that backyard area and had been seen hanging out there. Further,
    the police had been told that the 84 Vanauley Walk address was a “problem” in
    relation to suspected drug trafficking. In fulfilling their professional
    duties, the police were lawfully entitled to enter this backyard area in an
    effort to ascertain if any of the young men was an occupier of the residential
    premises there, and to pursue their investigations in relation to [the wanted
    man] and potential drug trafficking…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have no quarrel with the trial judge’s description of the implied licence
    doctrine and the principles underlying that doctrine. I question, however,
    whether the doctrine could have application on the facts before the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    implied licence doctrine, like most common law solutions, provides a fact-sensitive
    answer to a practical problem. The common law has always jealously guarded real
    property rights, especially as they relate to state intrusions into persons’ homes:
    see <em>R. v. Tessling</em>, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at paras. 14, 22.
    At the same time, the common law, and later statutory law, impose duties on the
    police that could, in certain circumstances, require the police to go onto a
    person’s property to speak to that person. The implied licence doctrine is the
    common law solution to the clash between police duties and the property rights
    of the individual. Under that doctrine, property rights or, in constitutional
    terms, the privacy of the owner/occupier, must yield, but only to the extent
    needed to allow the police, in the execution of their duties, to go onto the property
    to make contact with the owner or occupant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difficulty I have with the application of the implied licence doctrine in this
    case, is that the problem, which the doctrine addresses, had not arisen when
    the officers entered the backyard. There does not appear to have been any need
    for the police to enter the property to make contact with the occupier. As
    counsel for the appellant argued, the police could very easily have
    communicated with the five young men in the backyard while standing on the other
    side of the short fence. In doing so, the police would, in all likelihood, have
    been able to identify the occupant of the townhouse and requested permission to
    enter the property. Inquiries from the other side of the fence of the young men
    sitting in the backyard was an obvious first step toward identifying the
    occupant of the townhouse. I am inclined to the view that it was a prerequisite
    to any lawful uninvited entry onto the property for the purpose of
    communicating with the occupant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    need not come to any firm conclusion on the question of whether the police
    unlawfully entered the property. I will assume that they did for the purposes
    of considering the s. 8 claim. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming the police were unlawfully in the backyard, did they breach the
    appellant’s s. 8 rights?</p>

    8 of the <em>Charter</em> protects an individual’s reasonable expectation of

    v. Orlandis-Habsburgo</em>, 2017 ONCA 649, 352 C.C.C. (3d) 525, at para. 37.
    State conduct that infringes on an individual’s reasonable expectation of
    privacy will be treated as a search for the purposes of s. 8: <em>R. v. Buhay</em>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering a reasonable expectation of privacy claim, the court begins by
    identifying the subject matter of the claim. It then asks first, did the
    claimant have a subjective expectation of privacy in the subject matter, and
    second, if so, was that expectation objectively reasonable? The second of these
    two inquiries is almost inevitably the determinative consideration: <em>Spencer</em>,
    at para. 18; <em>Tessling</em>, at para. 32. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is unclear to me whether there was any evidence accepted by the trial judge
    that would warrant the conclusion that the appellant had a subjective
    expectation of privacy in respect of the backyard. I will, however, focus on
    the objective component of the inquiry. That exercise begins by identifying the
    subject matter of the claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    reasonable expectation of privacy does not exist in the air or in the abstract.
    One has or does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of a
    specified subject matter in specified circumstances: <em>Spencer</em>, at
    paras. 22-33; <i>R. v. <em>Marakah</em></i>, 2017 SCC 59, 142 W.C.B. (2d) 490, at
    paras. 14-15.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    subject matter of a privacy claim may be the person of the claimant, a place,
    information, or a combination of the three: <em>Tessling</em>, at paras. 20-23; <em>R. v. Ward</em>, 2012 ONCA 660, 112 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 60. The factors
    that will be relevant to the determination of whether a reasonable expectation
    of privacy exists and the weight to be assigned to any particular factor will depend
    in large measure on the subject matter of the privacy claim. For example, if
    the privacy claim is informational, the potential capacity of the information
    to reveal core biographical data relating to the claimant will be crucial in
    assessing the privacy claim. However, if the subject matter of the privacy
    claim is a place, control over that place will play a central role in assessing
    the validity of a reasonable expectation of privacy claim. If the privacy claim
    has both a territorial and informational component, then all of the relevant
    factors will be considered: see <em>Tessling</em>, at para. 22; <em>Spencer</em>,
    at paras. 34-40; <em>Marakah</em>, at paras. 38-44; <em>R. v. Jones</em>, 2017

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant advances an exclusively territorial privacy claim. He maintains that
    the moment the police entered the Dixon backyard they violated his s. 8 right.
    The appellant does not assert a privacy claim that depends on what the
    appellant was doing or what he was saying while in the Dixon backyard. There is
    no informational component to this privacy claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    subject matter of the appellant’s privacy claim, that is the police entry into
    the Dixon backyard, renders cases like <em>R. v. Wong</em>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36,
    unhelpful in resolving the appellant’s claim. In <em>Wong</em>, the police,
    without any judicial authorization, installed a video camera in a hotel room and
    videotaped all of the activities of anyone who happened to be in the room. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue for the Court was not the reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of
    the physical space occupied by the hotel room, but the reasonable expectation
    of privacy in respect of what people in the room were doing and saying to each
    other. The Court had to decide whether a person in a hotel room, as a renter or
    a guest, had a reasonable expectation that the state would not surreptitiously
    record his every move and every word. LaForest J., for the majority, said at p.
    51:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is safe to presume that a multitude of functions open to
    invited persons are held every week in hotel rooms across the country. These
    meetings will attract persons who share a common interest but who will often be
    strangers to each other. Clearly, persons who attend such meetings cannot
    expect their presence to go unnoticed by those in attendance. <em>But, by the
    same token, it is no part of the reasonable expectation of those who hold or
    attend such gatherings that as a price of doing so they must tacitly consent to
    allowing agents of the state unfettered discretion to make a permanent
    electronic recording of the proceedings.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> [Emphasis added.]</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Wong</em> would have relevance to this case, had the police purported to surreptitiously
    record or otherwise memorialize what the appellant was doing or saying when he
    was in the Dixon backyard. The appellant’s status as an invited guest in the
    backyard may be an important consideration in determining whether he had a
    reasonable expectation of privacy as it related to what he said and did while in
    the backyard.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge (at para. 82) correctly identified <em>R. v. Edwards</em>, [1996] 1
    S.C.R. 128, as the pertinent authority. <em>Edwards</em> dealt with a
    territorial privacy claim. The trial judge referred to the criteria listed in <em>Edwards</em> as helpful in assessing a privacy claim in respect of property. He correctly
    noted that apart from the appellant’s physical presence in the backyard when
    the police entered, none of the criteria identified in <em>Edwards</em> existed
    in this case. The appellant had no possession or control of any kind over the
    backyard. There was no evidence of the appellant’s historical use of, or
    connection with, the property. The appellant had no means by which to regulate
    access to the property. He was, as the trial judge indicated, “a mere transient
    guest in the Dixon backyard” (para. 81).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    weakness of the appellant’s privacy claim in respect of the Dixon backyard is
    best demonstrated by comparing it to the claim <em>unsuccessfully</em> advanced
    in <em>Edwards</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Edwards</em>, the apartment, which was the subject of the search, was
    rented by the accused’s girlfriend. They had been dating for three years. The
    accused stayed at the apartment from time to time and had left there
    immediately before his arrest shortly prior to the search. The accused kept
    personal belongings in the apartment and he had a key to the apartment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court split on whether the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in
    relation to his girlfriend’s apartment. The majority held that he did not: see <em>R.
    v. Edwards</em> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 239 (C.A.). In the Supreme Court of
    Canada, Cory J., speaking for the majority, held that the accused had no
    reasonable expectation of privacy. Adopting the language of McKinlay J.A. in
    this court, Cory J., at para. 47, referred to the accused as “no more than an
    especially privileged guest”. Cory J. observed that the accused had no authority
    to regulate access to the apartment, no ability to exclude others from the
    apartment, and had made no contribution to the maintenance of the apartment. All
    of those observations could be made of the appellant’s connection to the Dixon
    backyard.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Edwards</em> identifies control as a key factor in the assessment of a territorial privacy
    claim. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that holding in<em> Jones</em>, at
    para. 40:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>The control and access factors have also been particularly
    salient in territorial privacy cases.</em> As suggested above, land owners and
    tenants have a practical ability to exclude visitors from their territory and
    maintain a choice to be left alone by controlling access to their domicile… [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    can the result in <em>Edwards</em> be explained by the purported consent of the
    girlfriend to the search of her apartment. The police used lies and tricks to
    obtain that consent. Cory J. expressly held that in concluding that the accused
    had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment, he found it
    unnecessary to decide whether the girlfriend had consented to the search: <em>Edwards</em>,
    at paras. 6, 51.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

    been applied many times. For example, in </span></em><em>R. v. Belnavis, </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[1997] 3 S.C.R. 341, the court considered whether a
    passenger in a motor vehicle had a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect
    of the inside of the motor vehicle. After acknowledging that the claim had to
    be evaluated on the totality of the circumstances, Cory J., in rejecting the
    privacy claim, said, at para. 22:</span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In this case, although Lawrence [the passenger] was present at
    the time of the search, there are few other factors which would suggest she had
    an expectation of privacy in the vehicle. First, her connection to the vehicle
    was extremely tenuous. She did not own the vehicle, she was merely a passenger
    in a car driven by a friend of the owner of the vehicle. <em>There was no
    evidence that she had any control over the vehicle, nor that she used it in the
    past or had any relationship with the owner or driver which would establish
    some special access to or privilege in regard to the vehicle. Lawrence did not
    demonstrate any ability to regulate access to the vehicle</em>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just
    as with the passenger in <em>Belnavis</em>, there was no evidence that the

    relationship with the owner or occupant that would establish some special
    access, or had any ability to regulate access to the property. </p>

    also reflect a normative evaluation of societal expectations and aspirations as
    they relate to personal privacy: see </span></em><em>Orlandis-Habsburgo</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at paras. 41-43. The assessment of whether a person
    has a reasonable expectation of privacy is not limited by, or dependent upon,
    property law concepts even if the subject matter of the claim is real property.
    Those concepts can, however, inform the inquiry into issues like control and
    access that are central to the reasonable expectation of privacy inquiry when
    real property is the subject matter of that inquiry: see </span></em><em>Hunter

    leads me to conclude that the appellant has no claim to a reasonable
    expectation of privacy in the Dixon backyard. On the facts of <em>Edwards</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, the accused’s privacy claim in his girlfriend’s
    apartment was far superior to the appellant’s claim in respect of the Dixon
    backyard and yet it failed. Similarly, the passenger in </span></em><em>Belnavis</em><em><span

    view, include some ability, either as a matter of law, or in the circumstances
    as they existed, to control who can access and/or stay on the property. One
    cannot realistically talk about a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect

    circumstances, to support a finding that the individual claiming the privacy
    interest has some kind of control over who could access or remain on the
    property. Physical presence may be evidence of control. However, on the facts
    of this case, the appellant’s presence in the backyard offers no support for
    finding that he had any element of control over the property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would test the appellant’s claim to a reasonable expectation of privacy this
    way. Assume that the appellant was the only person in the backyard. Mr. Dixon
    was in the house. The police arrive with a legitimate reason to speak to the
    occupant of the house. The appellant tells the police that he is an invited
    guest at the Dixon home and he orders the police to remain off the property.
    The police ignore the appellant’s order, enter the property, go to the door and
    knock, intending to speak to the occupant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the implied licence doctrine, the police were lawfully entitled to go onto the
    property in the hypothetical described above and knock on the door in an effort
    to speak with the occupant. The wishes of an invited guest could not detract
    from the authority of the police to enter the property to speak to the
    occupant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    I am correct in the hypothetical set out above, the invited guest’s inability
    to legally prevent the police from accessing the property to speak to the
    occupant is irreconcilable with a claim that the invited guest has an objective
    reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of access to the property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the trial judge that the police entry into the Dixon backyard did
    not breach the appellant’s right under s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=Heading>B: Section 9 of the <em>Charter</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits he was arbitrarily detained from the moment the police
    entered the backyard. He does not suggest that he was physically detained, but
    argues that the entirety of the circumstances warranted a finding of
    psychological detention as described in cases like <em>R. v. Suberu</em>, 2009
    SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at para. 25, and<i> <em>R. v. Grant</em></i>, 2009
    SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para. 44.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected this submission. He concluded that the appellant was not
    detained when the officers entered onto the property, but was detained when
    Constable O’Toole asked him what he had in the bag slung over his shoulder
    (para. 88). At that point, the interaction between the police and the appellant
    changed. The appellant became the target of Constable O’Toole’s focussed
    investigation. The appellant immediately fled the scene.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    can be no quarrel with the trial judge’s description of the relevant legal
    principles governing detention under s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em> (see para.
    85). In applying those principles to the case before him, the trial judge said,
    at paras. 89-90:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In reaching this conclusion I have tried to take a realistic
    appraisal of the entire transaction and, in so doing, have considered: (1) how
    the conduct of the police might reasonably have been perceived by the accused,
    especially given that one of the investigations they were pursuing concerned
    activities and/or individuals potentially in the Dixon backyard; (2) the nature
    and duration of the police interaction with the accused and his friends,
    including how the police addressed the accused and the other young men in the
    Dixon backyard, and telling one of the other young men to keep his hands in
    front of his body; and (3) the young age and visible minority status of the
    accused and his friends, and the comparatively slight physical stature of the
    accused.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The accused and the police officers describe the key events at
    this critical juncture differently, but I am satisfied that, even on the
    testimony of the police officers, which I accept, the accused was detained at
    that point in time, namely, when Cst. O’Toole asked the accused about the
    contents of his bag. The police were not able to effect a physical detention of
    the accused at that point in time, however, because as soon as the inquiry was
    made by Cst. O’Toole, the accused fled from the backyard. But, in my opinion,
    it was at that point that, as a matter of law, the accused was detained.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no error in the trial judge’s analysis. Nor can his findings be
    characterized as unreasonable. In assessing the reasonableness of the trial
    judge’s findings, the appellant’s own evidence is significant. The appellant
    testified that he believed he was free to leave the backyard after the police
    had entered and began questioning the young men. In other words, he did not
    think he was detained. The trial judge accurately summarized the appellant’s evidence,
    at para. 87:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>More particularly, the accused explained that he went to go
    inside the townhouse through the back door because he did not think he needed
    to remain in the backyard, as no police officer was talking directly to him. According
    to the accused, it was only when Cst. O’Toole physically prevented him from
    going into the townhouse that “things changed” and he did not think he could
    leave.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for psychological detention is an objective one: see <em>Grant</em>, at
    paras. 31, 44. The court must determine whether a reasonable person, in the
    appellant’s circumstances, would conclude that he or she was not free to go and
    had to comply with the police direction. Although the test is objective, the
    appellant’s perception that he was in fact free to leave and was not being detained
    by the police when they entered the backyard must be an important consideration
    in determining how the encounter between the officer and the appellant would be
    reasonably perceived. The appellant’s perception is particularly significant as
    he is no stranger to street-level encounters with the police. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s perception of the ongoing dynamic between himself and Constable
    O’Toole could reasonably be taken by the trial judge as a strong indication of
    how that dynamic would be reasonably perceived. More to the point, I cannot
    characterize as unreasonable, the trial judge’s conclusion as to the timing of
    the detention when that conclusion reflects the appellant’s own testimony about
    his perception of when his detention began. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found that the appellant was detained when Constable O’Toole asked him what was
    in the bag, the trial judge went on, at paras. 91-93, to determine that the
    appellant’s detention was lawful. He found that Constable O’Toole had
    reasonable grounds to suspect that the appellant was armed. That reasonable
    suspicion justified an investigative detention: see <em>Mann</em>, at para. 45; <em>R. v. MacKenzie</em>, 2013 SCC 50, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 250, at para. 35. The
    appellant fled before Constable O’Toole could physically detain him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge’s factual findings
    underlying his conclusion that Constable O’Toole had reasonable grounds to
    suspect that the appellant was armed. This court must make its own assessment
    of whether those facts meet the “reasonable suspicion” standard:<em> MacKenzie</em>,
    at para. 54. I think they do. The appellant’s movements simultaneously aroused
    the suspicions of two police officers who, based on their training and
    experience, connected the appellant’s movements to the possession of a weapon.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated in <em>MacKenzie</em>, at para. 63:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]n assessing whether a case for reasonable suspicion has been
    made out, the analysis of objective reasonableness should be conducted through
    the lens of a reasonable person “standing in the shoes of the police officer”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    test described takes into account officer training and experience: <em>MacKenzie</em>,
    at paras. 60-65.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied that, on the facts as found by the trial judge, there was a basis upon
    which Constable O’Toole could reasonably suspect that the appellant was armed.
    That suspicion justified an investigative detention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that the appellant’s detention was lawful, the trial judge proceeded
    on the basis that the police were lawfully in the backyard when the appellant’s
    detention occurred. As outlined above, there is reason to doubt the correctness
    of that conclusion. Assuming the officers were trespassers, does that change
    the lawfulness of the appellant’s detention? I do not think so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First
    of all, the determination of the point in time at which the police detained the
    appellant had no connection to the status of the police officers on the
    property. Whatever their status, on the trial judge’s findings, a reasonable
    person would not have considered himself detained until Constable O’Toole
    queried the contents of the bag. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    from the timing of the detention to its lawfulness, I do not think that the
    status of the officers as trespassers would affect the lawfulness of the
    appellant’s detention. Section 9 is intended to protect individuals from
    unlawful state intrusion upon the liberty of the individual. On the trial
    judge’s finding, there was no intrusion upon the appellant’s liberty until Constable
    O’Toole asked him what was in the bag. Even if the police were trespassers on the
    Dixon property, that trespass had no impact on any facet of the appellant’s
    liberty. His liberty was limited only after Constable O’Toole had reasonable
    grounds to suspect that the appellant was armed and committing a criminal
    offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    might well come to a different conclusion as to the lawfulness and, hence,
    arbitrariness of the detention if the police had unlawfully entered the
    property for the purposes of detaining the appellant and the other young men in
    the backyard. The situation may also have been different if the appellant could
    demonstrate that the improper entry into the backyard by the police somehow
    interfered with his personal rights or individual liberty. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the trial judge’s findings, the police did not enter the property intending to
    detain anyone. Nor did their entry in any way infringe upon any of the
    appellant’s rights. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, in the circumstances of this case, the lawfulness of the police entry into
    the backyard had no impact on either the determination of the point in time at
    which the appellant was detained, or the arbitrariness of that detention. There
    was no breach of the appellant’s s. 9 right, even if the police were
    trespassing.</p>
  <p class=Heading>C: Section 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>Assuming the police improperly entered the Dixon backyard
    and that this somehow resulted in a breach of the appellant’s rights under ss.
    8 or 9 of the <em>Charter</em>, I agree with the trial judge’s s. 24(2)
    analysis. As the trial judge observes at para. 106, any breach was “technical,
    inadvertent, and made in good faith”. The impact of any breach on the
    appellant’s <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>-protected
    liberty interest was momentary and minimal. The evidence was highly reliable
    and the crimes very serious.</span></em></p>

    requires a weighing and balancing of sometimes competing interests. The trial
    judge engaged in that exercise and I see no reason to come to a different

    Doherty J.A. I respectfully disagree with his analysis and his disposition, for
    the reasons that follow.<span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'> </span>I would exclude the evidence that
    was unlawfully obtained, allow the appeal, quash the appellant’s convictions
    and enter acquittals on all counts.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following propositions, which I will develop further, explain my reasoning.
    First, although my colleague is prepared to assume that the police entry into
    the fenced backyard was illegal, he does not allow that assumption to affect
    his subsequent reasoning. This is where I part company with him. The police
    entry was an unlawful trespass and this tainted everything that followed. The
    police did not have the occupant’s consent or an implied licence to enter the
    backyard. It is worth noting that had Leraldo Dixon, the occupant, expressly
    refused the police permission to enter, they would have had no grounds for a
    search warrant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the backyard
    comparable to that of the occupant whose guest he was. In my view, the unlawful
    police entry on a pleasant spring evening was the equivalent of entering a home
    through a door that happened to be open without first knocking. The appellant
    has standing to make the argument that the entry breached his s.&nbsp;8 <em>Charter</em> right. Any other approach would undermine the purposive application of the
    section. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    from the unlawful entry flow the arbitrary detention, the flight, the arrest,
    the search and the finding of the evidence - the gun, the drugs and the money.
    The intimidating and oppressive police entry operated to arbitrarily detain
    those present in the backyard including the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the kind of casually intimidating and oppressive misconduct involved in the
    unlawful police entry into the backyard must be condemned by the court. The
    gun, the drugs and the money should have been excluded from the trial evidence
    under s. 24 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing
    in my reasons is intended to discourage ordinary police practices like the
    proverbial constable on patrol, or the beat cop patrolling the neighbourhood.
    In particular, until the officers entered the backyard without seeking or
    getting permission, I would have found nothing in what they did to be
    questionable. But they crossed a bright and important line when they entered
    the backyard without permission or a warrant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will describe the facts in more detail before returning to explain these
    propositions.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the evening of May 25, 2012 the 20-year-old appellant was socializing with four
    friends in the backyard of a townhouse in a housing co-operative in Toronto.
    One of his friends, 17-year-old Leraldo Dixon, whose mother rented the
    townhouse, had invited the appellant and the other young men to the backyard.
    The appellant is Asian and his friends were Black.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    backyard was contiguous to a public walkway from which it was separated by a
    low wooden fence. There was an opening in the fence (which once held a gate now
    long gone) that served as an entryway into the backyard. There was conflicting
    evidence, on which nothing turns, about whether or not some cushions were
    propped up in the opening to form a make-shift gate.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    members of the Toronto Police Service were on duty in the area that evening.
    One of them, Cst. Teatero, broadcasted on the police radio that he was
    conducting an investigation in the area of the housing co-operative. Two other
    officers, Cst. Reid and Cst. O’Toole, decided to assist Cst. Teatero because he
    was working on his own. When they arrived, they saw Cst. Teatero talking to two
    security guards. He was asking the guards whether they knew the location of an
    individual wanted by police.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The security guards told the police that the wanted individual did not
    hang out in the housing co-operative, but mentioned another person who was of
    interest to the police. The police said that the security guard informed them
    that this other person hung out in the area behind Mr. Dixon’s townhouse. There
    was contradictory evidence about whether the security guards told the police
    that the townhouse was “problem address” and that they suspected drug
    trafficking occurred in the backyard.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police decided to do a “walk-through” of the common area of the co-operative to
    the edge of Mr. Dixon’s backyard. They arrived at the backyard opening and saw
    the five young men in the backyard. At trial, the police acknowledged that the
    men appeared to be doing nothing wrong and there was no indication of criminal
    activity. They had no reason to believe that anyone there was trespassing. The
    men were just talking.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
    asking for permission, two of the officers, Cst. Teatero and Cst.&nbsp;Reid,
    strode into the backyard. Cst. O’Toole stood outside the entry.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Once
    inside the backyard, Cst. Teatero immediately started questioning the young men
    in the backyard, asking who they were and if they lived there. Cst. Reid did
    the same and testified at trial that the purpose of asking those questions was
    to investigate whether they were trespassing under the <em>Trespass to Property
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.21. However, there was no trespass complaint to
    which the police were responding. Cst. O’Toole testified that he believed the
    officers were required to enter onto private property in order to continue the
    investigation as the men were not being cooperative or answering the officers’
    questions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers demanded identification from the young men. While he was taking an
    I.D. card from one of the other young men, Cst. O’Toole testified that he saw
    the appellant “blading himself”, shielding a shoulder bag that he was carrying
    away from the officers. This is a sign that he might be carrying a weapon.
    Cst.&nbsp;O’Toole asked him whether he had anything on him, which the appellant
    denied. Cst. O’Toole then asked what the appellant had in the bag, and the
    appellant immediately bolted, running away from the police. The appellant
    testified that he ran because he did not think he could walk away, that the
    officer was going to take his bag, and that he did not think the officer was
    right in trying to search him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers chased the appellant and tackled him a short distance away. They found
    a loaded handgun inside the shoulder bag and 13 grams of crack cocaine as well
    as some currency on the appellant’s person.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts, I observe that the police officers did not have a warrant. They did
    not ask for permission to enter the backyard before doing so, nor did they
    intend to proceed to the door and knock in order to speak to the occupant. The
    officers were not in active pursuit of a live investigation or a suspect. They
    were not responding to an emergent situation or to a complaint. The men in the
    backyard were doing nothing to provoke a police entry, such as engaging in
    obviously illegal activity or causing any form of disturbance. None of them
    were suspects. As noted, had the police been refused entry, they could not have
    obtained a warrant.</p>

    cases treat police entrances onto private property, of the sort undertaken
    here, under the rubric of a search within the meaning of s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>.
    See <em>R. v. Evans</em>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8, [1996] S.C.J. No. 1.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Canadian and English common law have long recognized that the occupier of a
    dwelling gives an implied licence to any member of the public, including police
    officers, on legitimate business to come to the door of the dwelling and knock: <em>R. v. Tricker</em> (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 575 (C.A.), leave to appeal to
    S.C.C. refused (1996), 103 C.C.C. (3d) vi (note); <em>Robson v. Hallett</em>,
    [1967] 2 Q.B. 939 (D.C.); <em>R. v. Clarke</em> (2005), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 426
    (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (2005), 214 O.A.C. 398 (note).
    The implied licence can be revoked by, for example, putting up signs
    prohibiting entry or by locking an entry gate: <em>Robson</em>, at pp. 953-54.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even in the absence of such an impediment to entry, the implied licence
    doctrine is not without limits. In <em>Evans</em>, Sopinka J., speaking for a
    plurality of the Supreme Court of Canada, recognized that an implied licence
    does not mean that all persons are welcome to approach a home regardless of the
    purpose of their visit. When members of the public (including police) exceed
    the terms of the implied licence, they approach the property as intruders: <em>Evans</em>,
    at paras. 15-16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Sharpe J.A. observed in <em>R. v. Mulligan</em>, [2000] O.J. No. 59, at
    para.&nbsp;27:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As with all police investigative powers, this licence must be
    strictly curtailed to avoid the risk of abuse. The officer must have a <em>bona
    fide</em> belief that gives rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity
    being perpetrated against the owner or occupant or the property. The police
    officer must be able to demonstrate an objective basis in fact that gives rise
    to his suspicion. To borrow the language of Doherty J.A. in <em>R. v. Simpson</em> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 at 500-501, discussing the common law power to
    detain a suspect for questioning, there must be some &quot;articulable
    cause&quot; above the level of a mere &quot;hunch&quot;, &quot;a constellation
    of objectively discernible facts which give the detaining officer reasonable
    cause to suspect that the detainee is criminally implicated in the activity
    under investigation.&quot;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What disturbed
    Sopinka J. in <em>Evans</em> was that the police were using the implied licence
    doctrine for an ulterior purpose. In that case, the police knocked on the door
    hoping to get a “whiff” of marijuana. Because their approach was not
    legitimately intended as an attempt to lawfully communicate with the occupants
    of the home, it was unlawful. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the context
    of a police approach to a home for the purpose of gathering evidence against
    the occupant, Sopinka J. reached the following conclusions, at paras. 16 and
    18:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>Clearly, occupiers of a dwelling
    cannot be presumed to invite the police (or anyone else) to approach their home
    for the purpose of substantiating a criminal charge against them. Any

    to knock&quot; simply fails to extend that far. </span><span class=Underline>As
    a result, where the agents of the state approach a dwelling with the intention
    of gathering evidence against the occupant, the police have exceeded any

  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>[</span>W]here the police, as here,
    purport to rely on the invitation to knock and approach a dwelling for the
    purpose, inter alia, of securing evidence against the occupant, they have
    exceeded the bounds of any implied invitation and are engaging in a <em>search</em> of the occupant's home.<span style='background:white'> Since the implied

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Sopinka
    explained the policy reasons for this conclusion, at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, there are sound policy reasons for holding that the
    intention of the police in approaching an individual's dwelling is relevant in
    determining whether or not the activity in question is a &quot;search&quot;
    within the meaning of s. 8. If the position of my colleague is accepted and
    intention is <em>not</em> a relevant factor, the police would then be
    authorized to rely on the &quot;implied licence to knock&quot; for the purpose
    of randomly checking homes for evidence of criminal activity. The police could
    enter a neighbourhood with a high incidence of crime and conduct surprise
    &quot;spot-checks&quot; of the private homes of unsuspecting citizens,
    surreptitiously relying on the implied licence to approach the door and knock. Clearly,
    this Orwellian vision of police authority is beyond the pale of any
    &quot;implied invitation&quot;. As a result, I would hold that in cases such as
    this one, where evidence clearly establishes that the police have specifically
    adverted to the possibility of securing evidence against the accused through
    &quot;knocking on the door&quot;, the police have exceeded the authority
    conferred by the implied licence to knock.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent
    contends, rightly in my view, that the expansive language used in <em>Evans</em> should not be read as a general prohibition against police approaching a
    dwelling in order to question its occupants for the purposes of furthering a
    lawful investigation. In support of this proposition, the respondent points to <em>R.
    v. Bushman</em>, [1968] 4 C.C.C. 17 (B.C.C.A.), and <em>Tricker</em>. Both were
    cases where the police approached a residence to seek to question its
    occupants. Both were cited by Sopinka J. in <em>Evans</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not believe
    the cases proffered by the Crown about whether police can enter a property to
    confront a drunk driving suspect have any relevance by analogy. An example is <em>Lotozky</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will now apply
    Sopinka J.’s reasoning in <i>Evans </i>to this case.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Principles Applied</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the police entry into the backyard was lawfully
    justified by operation of the implied licence doctrine. He summarized his
    conclusions, at para. 70:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>In the circumstances of the
    present case, the police officers clearly had a lawful reason to enter the
    backyard property and speak to the occupier.&nbsp;They were pursuing an
    investigation of a wanted man who, they had been told, frequented that backyard
    area and had been seen hanging out there.&nbsp;Further, the police had been
    told that the … address was a “problem” in relation to suspected drug
    trafficking.&nbsp;In fulfilling their professional duties, the police were
    lawfully entitled to enter this backyard area in an effort to ascertain if any
    of the young men was an occupier of the residential premises there, and to
    pursue their investigations in relation to Mr. Jackson and potential drug
    trafficking.&nbsp;There was no signage in the area that suggested the police
    were prohibited from entering the backyard, and no occupier of the premises
    ever expressly revoked their implied licence to enter the backyard
    area.&nbsp;In short, the police officers were never trespassers in the backyard
    area of this address.&nbsp;They entered lawfully pursuant to the implied
    licence doctrine, and remained there lawfully as they were never asked to leave
    by an occupier of the dwelling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree. In
    my view, the police entry was no better than a speculative criminal
    investigation, or a “fishing expedition.” This is the kind of police conduct
    Sopinka J. deplored in <em>Evans</em>, at para. 20. There is not even a
    scintilla of a “hunch”, as Doherty J.A. noted in <em>Simpson</em>, at para. 61.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would find
    that the police entry into the backyard of the townhouse exceeded the bounds of
    the implied licence doctrine and was, as a result, unlawful. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are
    several reasons for this conclusion. First, I read <em>Evans</em> as precluding
    reliance on the implied licence doctrine where the police approach a home
    without a <em>bona fide</em> intention to communicate with its occupants about
    an investigation. Police cannot use the implied licence doctrine to embark on a
    “fishing expedition”. The police officers did not approach the front door, the
    back entry into the backyard, or the back door of the townhouse in order to
    communicate with the occupants. They walked into the backyard of the private
    residence without seeking or obtaining permission of an occupant and
    immediately began questioning the persons they found there. The police conduct
    here was not consistent with the purpose of the implied licence doctrine. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the
    police did not intend to speak to the property’s occupant, but to conduct a
    random investigation of the backyard’s occupants, whose identity was unknown to
    them, who were not specifically identified as suspects in any crimes, and who
    were not engaged in criminal conduct. The trial judge’s conclusion that the
    police lawfully entered the backyard to determine the occupants’ identities or
    if they were trespassing, at para. 70, is unreasonable. At most, the police had
    information that a wanted man had been seen around the premises in the past and
    that the backyard was a “problem” in relation to suspected drug trafficking.
    Cst. Reid testified that the purpose was to investigate trespassing, but there
    was no trespassing complaint, and no indication to the officers that any of the
    young men might be trespassing. Even if it was accepted that the officers had a <em>bona fide</em><i> </i>belief, they did not have “an objective basis in
    fact” that any criminal activity was being perpetrated: <em>Mulligan</em>, at
    para.&nbsp;27. As soon as the police arrived at the backyard, they immediately
    started investigating the identity of the backyard’s occupants. In acting in
    this manner, the police exceeded their licence to enter private property “for
    the purpose of dealing with a suspected crime”: <em>Mulligan</em>, at para. 26.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Third, although
    a visitor to a property can reasonably attempt to make contact with an occupant
    by means other than the front door as an incident of the implied licence
    doctrine, that logic does not apply here. <em>Robson</em> acknowledges that a
    visitor might approach the back door of a residence through the garden. The
    doctrine authorizes members of the public (including police), in the words of
    Diplock L.J., “to proceed from the gate to the front door or the back door, and
    to inquire whether he may be admitted and to conduct his lawful business”: <em>Robson</em>,
    at p. 954. I have noted that the officers did not intend to approach the door,
    so <i>Robson</i> does not apply. Moreover, if an occupant appears to be present
    in the backyard, then the logical underpinnings of the implied licence doctrine
    disappear. If the police can freely communicate with the occupant of a property
    without entering onto it, as was the case here, then the implied licence
    doctrine has no application since the communication can be accomplished without
    the entry. Entry onto the property is simply not necessary for the police to
    conduct their “lawful business”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, I draw
    no substantial distinction between the backyard area and the front hall of a
    house. Most people would be utterly shocked and appalled by the sudden
    appearance of police officers in their backyard or the front hall of the house
    in the absence of emergent circumstances. It is not unusual, on a pleasant
    spring evening, to find an occupant lounging with guests in the backyard or in
    a house in which the front door has been left ajar to catch the breeze. In
    these circumstances, the fact that private space may be publicly visible does
    not reduce an occupant’s reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am of the view
    that the police entry in this case was similar to the unacceptable police
    conduct in <em>Evans,</em> and not to the conduct in <em>Bushman</em> or <em>Tricker</em>.
    The implied licence doctrine had no application here. The police unlawfully
    entered the backyard as trespassers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge’s erroneous finding that the implied licence doctrine permitted the
    police entry underpinned his <em>Charter</em> rulings. It is therefore
    necessary to consider several <em>Charter</em> issues afresh on appeal. Before
    doing so I must consider the appellant’s standing to challenge the rulings.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Appellant has Standing to Challenge the Misconduct of Police </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complaint
    about the unlawful police entry into the backyard was framed at trial as a
    breach of s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. However, based on <em>R. v. Edwards</em>,
    [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128, the trial judge concluded, at para. 82, that: “the accused
    has no standing to advance a claim under s. 8 of the <em>Charter </em>on the
    basis of any alleged trespass to the Dixon backyard.”</p>
  <h5 style='page-break-after:auto'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Governing Principles</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any s. 8 <em>Charter</em> challenge to police entry, there are two distinct questions that must be
    answered. First, the court must determine that the accused had a reasonable
    expectation of privacy<span style='color:black;background:white'> in the
    totality of the circumstances</span>. If not, the accused does not have
    standing to raise the challenge. The second question is whether the alleged
    search was an unreasonable intrusion on that privacy. This flows from <em>Edwards</em>,
    at para. 45, where Cory J. summarized the law, following <em>Hunter v. Southam</em>,
    [1984] <span class=reflex3-alt><span style='color:black;background:white'>2
    S.C.R. 145</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>, at pp.
    158-59</span>, where the Supreme Court of Canada recognized that privacy, as a
    constitutional concept, should be distanced from privacy interests defined by
    ownership or proprietary interests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Edwards</em>, Cory J. noted, at para. 45, that s. 8
    “protects people and not places”. This no longer seems to be a complete
    statement of the law, as the Supreme Court and lower courts have continued to
    wrestle with privacy as<span style='line-height:200%'> “a protean concept”,
    which now includes “personal privacy, territorial privacy and informational
    privacy”: </span><em>R. v. Tessling</em>,<i> </i>[2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at paras.
    20, 25<span style='line-height:200%'>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well
    recognized that individuals enjoy a strong reasonable expectation of privacy in
    their homes: <em>MacDonald</em>, at para. 26; <em>R. v. Godoy</em>, [1999] 1
    S.C.R. 311, at para. 19; <em>R. v. Feeney</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13. However,
    this strong expectation of privacy has not generally been held to extend to
    guests who are invited into the private residences of other people. This is a
    consequence of both the application of the factors articulated by Cory J. in <em>Edwards</em><i>,</i> and the result, in which Mr. Edwards was found not to have had a reasonable
    expectation of privacy even as a “privileged guest” in his girlfriend’s
    apartment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, the
    jurisprudence has recognized that individuals do have reasonable expectations
    of privacy even in respect of the property they occupy but do not own. Some
    examples follow. In <em>R. v. Belnavis</em>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 341, the driver of
    a vehicle she did not own was found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy
    in the vehicle, though the passenger of the same vehicle did not. In that case,
    Cory J. noted that “there may well be other situations in which a passenger
    could establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in a vehicle”. He added
    that in many cases, depending on the circumstances, there would be little
    difference in the expectation of privacy of the different occupants of a
    vehicle, at para. 23. In <em>R. v. Wong</em>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 36, the accused
    was found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a hotel room he
    occupied. In <em>Feeney</em>, the accused had a reasonable expectation of
    privacy in a trailer he resided in but did not own (at para.&nbsp;23). Further,
    there is generally an expectation of privacy in an automobile on a public
    roadway, albeit diminished: <em>R. v. Harflett</em>, 2016 ONCA 248, 336 C.C.C. (3d)
    102, at para. 47.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <span
style='line-height:200%'>“protean concept” is evolving as circumstances raise
    new perspectives.</span></p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Principles Applied</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, based
    on <em>Edwards</em>, the trial judge found, at para. 82, that the accused had
    no standing to advance a claim under s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em> “on the basis
    of any alleged trespass to the Dixon backyard.” I disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Edwards</em> does not justify the denial of
    standing to the appellant to challenge the lawfulness of the police entry onto
    the property where he was present as a guest, for two reasons. First, there is
    a critical distinction to be noted. Mr. Edward’s girlfriend was the occupant
    who was entitled to give the police permission to enter and search the
    apartment. The appellant was not present when the police were given permission
    by the occupant, and they found the appellant’s drug stash. The Supreme Court
    noted that Mr.&nbsp;Edwards was no more than a “privileged guest” who did not
    have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his girlfriend’s residence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By parity of
    reasoning, had the police in this case sought and obtained the occupant’s
    permission to enter the backyard, the appellant would have had no complaint
    about the police entry, but that did not happen. The same logic applies to
    render unpersuasive my colleague’s hypothetical about the appellant’s lack of
    control over the premises. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second
    reason <em>Edwards</em><i> </i>does not decide the issue is in the application
    of the <em>Edwards</em><i> </i>factors. Justice Cory listed them at para. 45 of <em>Edwards</em>, for courts to consider in assessing “the totality of the
    circumstances.” These include the accused’s “presence at the time of the
    search”; his degree of “possession or control of the property or place
    searched”; the “ownership of the property or place”; the “historical use of the
    property or item”; “the ability to regulate access, including the right to
    admit or exclude others from the place”. Justice Cory held that the accused was
    obliged to show both “the existence of a subjective expectation of privacy” and
    “the objective reasonableness of the expectation.” It is worth noting that the
    assessment is not limited to these factors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    considered these factors, at para. 82:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While the accused certainly was present in the backyard at the
    time of the police entry, and claimed to have a subjective expectation of
    privacy with respect to the Dixon backyard equal to the privacy he expected in
    his own backyard, in my view there was no objective reasonableness in that
    claimed expectation. Moreover, none of the remaining <em>Edwards</em> criteria
    are met in the present case, in that: (1) the accused did not have possession
    or control of the backyard property; (2) the accused had no ownership of the
    backyard property; (3) the accused established no historical use of the
    backyard property; and (4) the accused had no ability to regulate access to the
    backyard property by admitting or excluding others.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    trial judge’s application of the <em>Edwards</em> factors was not reasonable in
    significant measure because it was not purposive.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accused’s
    presence at the time looms large in the contextual reasonable expectation of
    privacy analysis required in this case. The remainder of the <em>Edwards</em><i> </i>factors, as my colleague points out, do not arise in these circumstances or
    in circumstances when the accused’s status is as a guest. (I note in passing
    that in <i>R. v. Marakah</i>, 2017 SCC 59, at para. 38, the majority noted that
    “control is not an absolute indicator of a reasonable expectation of privacy,
    nor is lack of control fatal to a privacy interest,” albeit in relation to text
    messages.) I am of the view that the appellant’s invited presence alone is
    sufficient to give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The result
    might very well have been different in <em>Edwards</em> had the accused been
    present. In <em>Wong</em>, at para. 22, it was held that members of the public
    who attend a meeting in a hotel room have a reasonable expectation of privacy.
    While there are circumstances in which a guest would not have the same privacy
    rights as his host, these are not found here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case,
    the appellant was an invited guest at the home of Mr. Dixon. As an invited
    guest, the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his friend’s
    home while he was there.<i> </i>I have no hesitation in saying that the
    appellant has shown both the existence of a subjective expectation of privacy
    and the objective reasonableness of the expectation. The logic of the implicit
    contrary assertion must be rejected as utterly inconsistent with ordinary life
    in our free and democratic society. There are two elements to that implicit
    contrary assertion: the first is that while his host Mr. Dixon would have full
    Charter protection, as his guest, the appellant had none; the second is that
    the appellant left his personal <em>Charter</em> protections at home and could
    not resume them until he returned there. It would be hard to imagine that any
    citizen would accede to these propositions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Factors other
    than those listed in <em>Edwards</em><i> </i>also establish a reasonable
    expectation of privacy. The appellant was involved in a discussion with Mr.
    Dixon, who had a reasonable expectation of privacy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The result, in
    my view, is that the appellant has standing to assert an infringement of his s.
    8 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>right. The police entry, as I have found, was
    unlawful and unreasonably infringed that right. As a result, the question of
    whether the evidence obtained by the police should be excluded arises. Before
    addressing that question I turn to the issue of the detention, for two reasons.
    First, although it is possible to distinguish conceptually the entry from the
    detention, in reality they occurred simultaneously. Second, the unacceptability
    of the police conduct is amply shown by the profoundly oppressive circumstances
    of the reality of the detention, to which I now turn.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Unlawful Police Entry Resulted in the Appellant’s Arbitrary
    Detention</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the
    appellant argued that as soon as the police unlawfully entered the backyard
    area of the townhouse, he was arbitrarily detained in violation of s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>.
    The trial judge rejected his argument, finding that he was not detained until
    Cst. O’Toole asked him what was in his bag. </p>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Governing Principles</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    9 of the <em>Charter</em> provides that “Everyone has the right not to be
    arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.” As Watt J.A. noted in <em>R. v. Donnelly</em>,
    2016 ONCA 988, 135 O.R. (3d) 336, at para. 67: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Section] 9 is a manifestation of the general principle,
    articulated in s. 7, that a person’s liberty is not to be curtailed except in
    accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. This is one of the most
    fundamental norms of the rule of law. The state may not detain arbitrarily, but
    only in accordance with the law: <em>R. v. Grant</em>,&nbsp;2009 SCC
    32,&nbsp;[2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at para.&nbsp;54;&nbsp;<em>Charkaoui v. Canada
    (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>,&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2007/2007scc9/2007scc9.html"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>2007 SCC 9</span></a>,&nbsp;[2007]
    1 S.C.R. 350, at para.&nbsp;88. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of
    s. 9 is to “protect individual liberty from unjustified state interference”: <em>Grant</em>,
    at para. 20. While individuals are free to do as they please absent a valid law
    to the contrary, the police are only entitled to act to the extent that the law
    empowers them to do so: <em>R. v. Gonzales</em>, 2017 ONCA 543, 136 O.R. (3d)
    225, at para. 51; <em>R. v. Mann</em>, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59, at
    para. 15.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our law
    recognizes that the police have a common law power to briefly detain
    individuals for the purposes of an investigation in certain prescribed
    circumstances. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Mann</em> and <em>Grant</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em>that brief investigative detentions
    will be lawful where they are based on “reasonable suspicion”: <em>Grant</em>,
    at para. 55; <em>Mann</em>, at paras. 23-35.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A “detention”
    may arise in a number of ways. It can arise as a consequence of a suspension of
    an individual’s liberty interest by significant physical means, for example, by
    being handcuffed or placed in the back of a police car. An individual can be
    psychologically detained when he is lawfully required to comply with a police
    direction or demand, <span style='color:black;background:white'>or where a
    reasonable person in his position would conclude he had no choice but to
    comply: </span><em>Grant</em><span style='color:black;background:white'>, at
    paras. 20, 44. In this case the appellant’s psychological detention is at
    issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A contextual
    analysis is required to determine if an individual is psychologically detained.
    In <em>Grant</em>, the Supreme Court referred to the following factors, at
    para. 44:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) The circumstances giving rise to the encounter as they
    would reasonably be perceived by the individual: whether the police were
    providing general assistance; maintaining general order; making general
    inquiries regarding a particular occurrence; or, singling out the individual
    for focussed investigation.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) The nature of the police conduct, including the language
    used; the use of physical contact; the place where the interaction occurred;
    the presence of others; and the duration of the encounter.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) The particular characteristics or circumstances of the
    individual where relevant, including age; physical stature; minority status;
    level of sophistication.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With those
    factors in mind, I turn to the analysis under s.&nbsp;9 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Principles Applied</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that
    the detention of the appellant was not authorized by law. It was arbitrary and
    it breached his s. 9 <em>Charter </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>right</span></em>.
    Properly considered, in my view the <em>Grant</em> factors cannot reasonably
    support the trial judge’s finding, at para. 88, that the appellant was only
    psychologically detained once Cst. O’Toole inquired about the contents of the
    appellant’s bag. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I am
    satisfied that the appellant was psychologically detained by the police within
    the meaning of s. 9 when they suddenly and without seeking permission barged
    into the backyard of the townhouse property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the police
    arrived at the backyard, two officers entered through the only gate through the
    fence into the backyard. The third officer remained outside the fence for a
    time before entering. The police were physically between the young men and the
    exit from the backyard. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the
    atmosphere the police created by their questioning would lead a reasonable
    person in the appellant’s position to believe that he had no choice but to
    comply with their demands. At one point in the interaction, one of the young
    men put his hands behind his back. Two of the officers told or yelled at him to
    keep his hands where they could see them. The police were asking pointed
    questions. It was not a casual conversation. This was not an atmosphere where
    the young men had any freedom of movement. The appellant says this created an
    atmosphere of detention. I agree. The suggestion that the appellant was free to
    leave simply has no reality to it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the
    appellant’s young age, minority status, and his comparatively small physical
    stature also favour a finding of psychological detention by police upon their
    entry in the backyard. In summary, all three factors of the <em>Grant</em><i> </i>analysis
    show that the appellant was detained at that moment, contrary to the trial
    judge’s conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, when
    police enter a property as trespassers, they act outside the bounds of their
    lawful authority. In my view, the detention of the appellant occasioned by the
    police while they were acting outside their lawful authority was, on its face,
    an arbitrary detention. It was not authorized by law because the police were
    not entitled to exercise any of their investigative powers, including the
    common law power to detain for investigative purposes, while they were
    trespassers on the property. What I see here, to be blunt, is casually
    intimidating and oppressive police misconduct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I
    would find that the appellant was arbitrarily detained within the meaning of s.
    9 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Evidence Should Have Been Excluded</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 24(2) of
    the <em>Charter</em> provides that where evidence is obtained in a manner that <span
style='background:white'>infringed or denied an accused’s </span><em>Charter</em><span
style='background:white'> rights or freedoms, the evidence “shall be excluded
    if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the
    admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice
    into disrepute.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the
    evidence – the gun, the drugs and the money - was obtained in a manner that
    infringed the appellant’s <em>Charter</em> rights. The evidence would never
    have been discovered if the police had not unlawfully entered the backyard,
    arbitrarily detained the appellant and thereby provoked his flight. The
    evidence was causally and temporally connected to the <em>Charter</em>-infringing
    conduct of the police: <em>R. v. Pino</em>, 2016 ONCA 389, 130 O.R. (3d) 561,
    at para. 72.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no
    doubt that the evidence obtained in this case – in particular, a handgun and
    drugs – was significant. However, despite its gravity, I would exclude the
    evidence from admission at the appellant’s trial, for the following reasons.</p>
  <h5 style='page-break-after:auto'>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Governing Principles</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The framework
    for the application of s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em> is set out in<i> <em>Grant</em></i>,
    at para. 71. The court must consider three lines of inquiry: (i) the
    seriousness of the <em>Charter</em>-infringing state conduct; (ii) the impact
    on the <em>Charte</em><i>r</i>-protected interests of the accused; and (iii)
    society's interest in adjudication on the merits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague Doherty
    J.A. explained the dimensions of this exercise in <em>R. v. McGuffie</em>, 2016
    ONCA 365, 131 O.R. (3d) 643, at paras. 62-63:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The first two inquiries work in tandem in the sense that both
    pull toward exclusion of the evidence. The more serious the state-infringing
    conduct and the greater the impact on the <em>Charter</em>-protected interests,
    the stronger the pull for exclusion. The strength of the claim for exclusion
    under s. 24(2) equals the sum of the first two inquiries identified in <em>Grant</em>.
    The third inquiry, society’s interests in an adjudication on the merits, pulls
    in the opposite direction toward the inclusion of evidence. That pull is
    particularly strong where the evidence is reliable and critical to the Crown’s
    case.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In practical terms, the third inquiry becomes important when
    one, but not both, of the first two inquiries pushes strongly toward the
    exclusion of the evidence. If the first and second inquiries make a strong case
    for exclusion, the third inquiry will seldom, if ever, tip the balance in
    favour of admissibility. Similarly, if both of the first two inquiries provide
    weaker support for exclusion of the evidence, the third inquiry will almost
    certainly confirm the admissibility of the evidence. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a
    standing temptation to place security concerns over legality concerns. The
    dilemma is a difficult one. However, as Brown J. observed in <em>R. v. Paterson</em>,
    2017 SCC 15, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 202, at para. 55, there is a “public interest in
    maintaining a justice system &#697;above reproach.&#697;&quot; Drawing on the
    observations of Doherty J.A. in <em>McGuffie</em>, Brown J. added, at para. 56:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is therefore important not to allow the third <em>Grant</em> <i>2009</i> factor of society's interest in adjudicating a case on its merits
    to trump all other considerations, particularly where (as here) the impugned
    conduct was serious and worked a substantial impact on the appellant's <em>Charter</em> right. In this case, I find that the importance of ensuring that such conduct
    is not condoned by the court favours exclusion. As Doherty J.A. also said in <em>McGuffie</em>,
    at para. 83, &quot;[t]he court can only adequately disassociate the justice
    system from the police misconduct and reinforce the community's commitment to
    individual rights protected by the <em>Charter</em> by excluding the evidence.
    … This unpalatable result is the direct product of the manner in which the
    police chose to conduct themselves.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What the
    jurisprudence under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter </em>recognizes is the
    problematic nature of the <em>Grant</em> calculus. The relevant age-old
    philosophical question is this: Do the ends justify the means? The usual answer
    is that bad means undermine good ends. The answer often yielded by the <em>Grant </em>calculus is this: Sometimes the achievement of a good end can
    retrospectively justify bad means. This tension is particularly pronounced in
    the case of guns obtained as a result of <em>Charter</em>-infringing police
    conduct. For instance, in <em>Grant</em>, the Supreme Court of Canada admitted
    a firearm. In <em>Paterson</em>, the majority excluded one. As it excluded the
    conversations in <i>Marakah.</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v.
    Harrison</em>, 2009 SCC 34, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 494, a case in which a large
    quantity of drugs was excluded based on a police breach of the accused’s
    s.&nbsp;8 <em>Charter</em> right, the Supreme Court, at para. 40, endorsed the
    words of Cronk J.A. in her dissent:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A]llowing the seriousness of the offence and the reliability
    of the evidence to overwhelm the s. 24(2) analysis &quot;would deprive those
    charged with serious crimes of the protection of the individual freedoms
    afforded to all Canadians under the <em>Charter</em> and, in effect, declare
    that in the administration of the criminal law 'the ends justify the
    means.'&quot;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice Cronk’s
    words bear repeating in this case. If the <em>Charter</em> is to have a
    meaningful presence in daily interactions between the police and citizens, the
    police must understand that if they trample the rights of citizen in their
    pursuit of a “good end”, the court will not sanction their misconduct. </p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Principles Applied</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    he found no breaches of the <em>Charter</em>, the trial judge conducted the s.
    24(2) <em>Charter </em>analysis using the three <em>Grant</em> factors, at
    paras.&nbsp;106-108: He concluded that all three of the factors favoured
    admission of the impugned evidence, and that on balance he would have admitted
    the evidence if the police had committed <em>Charter</em> breaches. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The seriousness of the <em>Charter</em>-infringing state conduct</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the seriousness of the of the <em>Charter</em>-infringing state
    conduct, the trial judge suggested that <em>any</em> potential breach of the
    accused’s <em>Charter </em>rights in the circumstances of this case was
    trivial, inadvertent and made in good faith. This conclusion is unreasonable
    and cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Charter</em>-infringing
    state conduct in this case was serious. I will not repeat the observations I
    made earlier. The police, on information about possible criminality that was at
    best speculative, unlawfully entered onto private property, someone’s home, as
    trespassers. This was serious police misconduct, in the context.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impact of the breach on the appellant’s <em>Charter</em>-protected
    interests</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that any breach of the appellant’s <em>Charter</em> rights did not have a significant impact on his interests. He noted that he did
    not make inculpatory statements or provide the police with incriminating
    evidence that they would not have otherwise discovered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the contrary,
    the breach did provide the police with incriminating evidence that they would
    not have otherwise discovered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impact on
    the appellant’s <em>Charter</em>-protected interests was significant. The right
    to be free from arbitrary detention is a manifestation of one of the most
    fundamental norms of the rule of law. Individual liberty can only be curtailed
    in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Here, the appellant’s
    liberty interest was unlawfully suspended. It cannot be said that an unlawful
    deprivation of liberty is an insignificant impact on the appellant’s
    constitutionally protected interests.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='page-break-after:auto'>(v)<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not take
    issue with the trial judge’s conclusion that the evidence in this case was
    reliable. I also agree that the evidence was of paramount importance to the
    Crown’s case against the appellant. Society unquestionably has a significant
    interest in the prosecution of firearm and drug offences on their merits.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='page-break-after:auto'>(vi)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the final
    balancing of the three inquiries under <em>Grant</em>, I take instruction from
    my colleague’s decision in <em>McGuffie</em>. I have found that the first two
    inquiries both pull toward the exclusion of the evidence. The seriousness of
    the state-infringing conduct and the impact on the appellant’s <em>Charter</em>-protected
    interests were both significant. In such a case, the third inquiry, the
    societal interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits, will “seldom,
    if ever, tip the balance in favour of admissibility”: <em>McGuffie</em>, at
    para. 63. See also<em> Paterson</em>, at paras. 55-56. The court cannot be seen
    to condone the kind of police misconduct at issue here. I conclude, as Brown J.
    did in <em>Paterson</em>,<i> </i>at para. 53, that the police conduct
    “represented a serious departure from well-established constitutional norms”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps the
    officers were emboldened by the sense they were doing the right thing in trying
    to root out criminality in the community. They seem to have assumed the young
    men in the backyard were up to no good and decided to confront them suddenly. I
    doubt that the police would have brazenly entered a private backyard and
    demanded to know what its occupants were up to in a more affluent and less
    racialized community. The occupant of a residence might tolerate sudden police
    intrusion into private space if there were an emergency or the police were in
    hot pursuit of a suspect or fugitive, however shocking they might find it.
    There is no such pretext in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I stated as
    the outset, the kind of casually intimidating and oppressive misconduct
    involved in the unlawful police entry into a private backyard must be condemned
    by the court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would exclude
    the items seized from the appellant from evidence at his trial. Their admission
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[165]<span

    the appeal, exclude the evidence obtained from the appellant in contravention
    of his <em>Charter</em> rights, quash the convictions and direct that verdicts
    of acquittal be entered.</p>

    Service (TPS) were specifically directed to the backyard area of the Dixon
    townhouse by the security guards working in the housing complex. The police
    were looking for a third party who was wanted by the police for some violent
    crimes and who, they were told, frequents the area and may have been hanging
    out in this area of the townhouse complex.&nbsp; The police had also been told
    that this was a problem address and that there were concerns about drug
    trafficking in the backyard.&nbsp; This area of the city is plagued by a high

    having any identification on his person and, when asked about his satchel,
    quickly fled from the area.&nbsp; Two of the police officers quickly gave chase
    and were, eventually, able to tackle the running accused to the ground on a
    nearby street.&nbsp; As they wrestled on the ground, with the two officers
    trying to subdue the accused, the police discovered the firearm in the
    satchel.&nbsp; Subsequently, they discovered his illicit drugs.</span></p>

    having an authorization, licence, or registration certificate; (4) careless

    O’Toole of the TPS were working together, on uniformed patrol, in a scout car
    in the area of 14 Division in Toronto.&nbsp; They were primarily responding to
    radio calls.&nbsp; After dealing with an unrelated noise complaint, they heard
    a radio communication from Cst. Fred Teatero indicating that he was
    investigating parties in the area of “Vanauley Walk.”&nbsp; This is an area of
    townhouses inside the Atkinson Housing Co-operative. &nbsp;Knowing that Cst.

    the overall security of the property, preventing vandalism and property damage,

    at another location.&nbsp; They had not seen him at the Atkinson Housing
    Co-operative.&nbsp; However, during their discussion, one of the security
    guards advised Cst. Teatero that Jermaine Jackson had been observed in the area
    and, more particularly, had been hanging out behind the townhouse located at 84
    Vanauley Walk.&nbsp; Cst. Teatero was told that this was a “problem address”
    for them, and there were concerns of drug trafficking in the rear yard.&nbsp;
    Mr. Lalley explained that there were some couches outside in this dingy
    backyard area, and Mr. Johnson “frequents that address” as he liked to hang out
    there with the “P.O Boys,” or the “Project Original Boys,” which was a gang in
    the area.&nbsp; Cst. Teatero knew of Mr. Jackson, and what he was “wanted for”

    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Based
    upon this evidence, I make the following findings of fact regarding this
    initial exchange between the police officers and the young men in the
    backyard.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;background:
white'><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>[<a name=par23>23</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:7.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>First,
    when Csts. Teatero and Reid entered the backyard through the open gate their
    purpose was twofold – to investigate whether any of the young men were Jermaine
    Jackson (or knew the whereabouts of Nicholas Dillon-Jack), and to investigate
    whether the young men were entitled to be in the backyard or were trespassing
    on the property.&nbsp; That was, in effect, the evidence of the police
    officers, and I accept it, especially given their initial purpose in attending
    at the housing complex and the information they had been provided by the
    security guards about the problems associated with the backyard area of this
    particular townhouse unit.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;background:
white'><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>[<a name=par24>24</a>]&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:7.0pt;color:black'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Second,
    Cst. Teatero greeted the young men by saying, “How are you guys doing?”&nbsp;
    He then asked whether any of them lived there in the townhouse.&nbsp; It seems
    likely that Mr. Dixon would have tried to identify himself as a resident of the
    unit when this initial inquiry was made by the police.&nbsp; He had no reason
    not to.&nbsp; But, the police officers did not, in fact, hear his initial
    positive response to their question.&nbsp; In the witness box, Mr. Dixon
    presented as a very quiet and soft-spoken young man.&nbsp; He was often
    difficult to hear, even from close range, and even after being told to speak
    up.&nbsp; He did not testify that, in identifying himself, he raised his arm or
    hand, and he likely would have given such evidence had he made any such
    accompanying physical gesture.&nbsp; In my view, in his testimony generally,
    Mr. Dixon did what he could to help the accused.&nbsp; In any event, I accept
    the evidence of the police officers that, initially, they did not see or hear
    any positive response to their question about whether any of the young men
    lived in the townhouse.&nbsp; They simply heard the accused say, “No.”</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;background:

    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Third, I
    find that Mr. Lewis may well have made some comment to his friends to the
    effect that the police were not entitled to just come into the backyard, but I
    am convinced that he made no such comment directly to any of the police
    officers.&nbsp; None of the officers heard any such objection to their presence
    in the backyard, and I accept their evidence in this regard.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;background:

    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Finally,
    I reject the evidence of Mr. Dixon that, in addition to trying to verbally
    identify himself to the police as a tenant of the townhouse, he told them, “You
    guys can’t come in here.”&nbsp; I find that Mr. Dixon simply manufactured this
    aspect of his evidence in order to try to help his friend, Mr. Le.&nbsp; I
    conclude that, in fact, Mr. Dixon never raised any objection to the presence of
    the police in his backyard, or suggested to them in any way that they should
    leave.</span></p>

    looked over his shoulder in their direction, to see the accused “blading” his

    the officers when they came into the backyard, but at this point, he was
    turning his right side toward the building.&nbsp; He was not trying to enter

    butt of the gun almost sticking out of the bag.&nbsp; With his hand on the
    outside of the bag, the officer could feel the handle of the gun.</span></p>

    continued to use periodic forearm strikes to the accused with his right hand to

    according to Cst. O’Toole, the accused still had his left hand on the bag, and
    he started trying to reach inside the bag for the gun.&nbsp; Cst. O’Toole, who
    still had his own left hand on the bag at the time, then tried to prevent the

    The accused was on his stomach.&nbsp; Cst. Reid testified that he tried to
    secure the right hand of the accused in order to handcuff it behind his back,
    but the accused struggled to resist his efforts.&nbsp; Cst. Reid started
    telling the accused to stop resisting and to put his hands behind his
    back.&nbsp; He heard Cst. O’Toole yelling to a similar effect.&nbsp; Cst. Reid
    testified that, at one point before the accused was finally subdued and
    handcuffed, he noticed that the accused had a black satchel or purse over his
    shoulder, but that, because of the struggle, it was on the ground beside his
    head area.&nbsp; Cst. Reid testified that, during the struggle, he saw Cst.
    O’Toole try to secure that satchel and, after feeling it, Cst. O’Toole advised
    that there was a firearm in the satchel.&nbsp; Cst. Reid described this as a
    “pretty tense” incident, which became even “more tense” when Cst. O’Toole
    announced the discovery of a gun in the satchel, given the danger inherent in
    dealing with firearms, the resistance of the accused, and being unsure whether
    he was reaching for the firearm or just trying to escape.</span></p>

    fighting back against the efforts of the two officers.&nbsp; It was an “all-out

    the accused’s shoulder, and was in the vicinity of his mid-section.&nbsp; Cst.
    Teatero testified that, as he observed the struggle, he saw the accused reach
    his hand toward the bag.&nbsp; Cst. Teatero could not see what Cst. O’Toole was
    doing as he was facing his back, and so he did not see if Cst. O’Toole touched

    step inside the house. &nbsp;Mr. Le explained that he did not think he needed

    own personal use, but to sell to others, potentially later that night.&nbsp; He
    also admitted that he had $650 in cash in his pocket from a drug sale he had

    that night as he knew that the Vanauley Walk area had “lots of violence,” with
    random people being shot in the neighbourhood, and the police were not doing
    anything about it, so he needed the gun for his own protection.&nbsp; The gun

    The accused contended that the police had no lawful right to enter this private

    that backyard area with the “Project Original Boys” gang, and that this was a
    “problem address” in relation to concerns about drug trafficking there.&nbsp;
    In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the police proceeded to
    attend at the backyard area of 84 Vanauley Walk.&nbsp; Indeed, given their
    professional obligations to preserve the peace, prevent the commission of
    crimes and other offences, assist potential victims of crimes, and generally
    protect the lives and property of the public, they likely were duty-bound to

    is clear that the occupier of a dwelling gives implied licence to any member of
    the public, including police officers, who are on legitimate business, to come
    onto the property, even through an unlocked gate, and attend at a door of the
    dwelling.&nbsp; This implied licence applies to anyone who has a lawful reason
    to speak to the occupier of the dwelling.&nbsp; This implied licence ends,
    however, at the door to the dwelling.&nbsp; The purpose of this implied licence
    is to facilitate convenient communication between members of the public and the
    occupier of the dwelling.&nbsp; This implied licence may be rebutted by some
    express notice on the property itself, or revoked explicitly by the occupier of
    the dwelling.&nbsp; Once revoked by the occupier, the person who entered upon
    the property pursuant to this implied licence is obliged to leave with
    reasonable dispatch.&nbsp; Anyone who does not so leave becomes a
    trespasser.&nbsp; If a police officer enters property pursuant to this implied
    licence and, before the licence is withdrawn, develops the necessary grounds to
    detain or arrest a suspect, the police remain entitled to detain or arrest that
    person and use proportional and reasonable force to do so.&nbsp; See: <i>Robson

    Mr. Jackson and potential drug trafficking.&nbsp; There was no signage in the

    no occupier of the premises ever expressly revoked their implied licence to
    enter the backyard area.&nbsp; In short, the police officers were never

    Court of Appeal in <i>Robson v. Hallett</i>, which forms the foundational basis
    of this doctrine in Canada, Diplock L.J. expressly stated, at p. 414, that when
    a householder does not lock the gate of the front garden of his or her

    “lawful reason” for doing so “to proceed from the gate to the <i>front door or

    While the front door typically may be where a member of the public (including a
    police officer) will attend to try to communicate with the occupier of a
    dwelling, the implied licence doctrine has been applied to permit the police,

    licence doctrine, construed sensibly, permitted the officers to enter the <i>backyard</i> area to pursue their investigations.&nbsp; By sensibly entering the backyard
    and engaging the young men in conversation, the police officers seized their
    best and most obvious opportunity to ascertain whether any of the young men
    occupied the townhouse, and to pursue their investigations.&nbsp; It would have
    been poor and ineffective policing for the officers to have walked around to
    the front door of the premises, in hopes that someone might answer their knocks
    on that door and perhaps permit them to speak with the young men that they had
    just seen in the backyard.</span></p>

    to the backyard, and strangers never went to the back door of the

    simply may never have had occasion, for a wide variety of potential reasons, to
    need to speak to any of the occupants of these other dwellings in their backyards.&nbsp;
    Perhaps police officers were never directed to any of these other backyards for
    investigative purposes.&nbsp; Perhaps these other backyards do not have an open

    every interaction between a police officer and a member of the public, for
    investigative purposes, amounts to a detention.&nbsp; Indeed, not every police
    stop of a member of the public constitutes a detention.&nbsp; As the Supreme
    Court of Canada has stated, a person is detained when he or she is subject to a
    “significant physical or psychological restraint” by the state.&nbsp; A
    psychological restraint occurs when a person is legally required to comply with
    a demand or direction that interferes with his or her liberty, or when a
    “reasonable person” in the subject’s position would conclude that he or she had
    been deprived of the freedom or liberty to choose whether or not to co-operate
    with the police.&nbsp; When an encounter between a police officer and an
    individual effectively “crystallizes” into a “detention” will depend on the
    circumstances of each case, but is an “objective” determination and will be for
    the trial judge to determine, applying the proper legal principles.&nbsp; The
    subjective intentions of the police are not determinative, and even a focused
    suspicion on the part of the police, by itself, will not turn an encounter into
    a detention.&nbsp; It will be for the trial Judge to undertake a “realistic
    appraisal of the entire transaction,” including consideration of the following
    three factors: (1) the circumstances giving rise to the encounter as would be
    reasonably perceived by the subject individual, including whether the police
    were providing general assistance, maintaining general order, making general
    inquiries regarding an occurrence, or singling out the individual for focused
    investigation; (2) the nature of the police conduct, including the language
    used, the use of physical contact, the place where the interaction occurred,
    the presence of others, and the duration of the encounter; and (3) the
    characteristics or circumstances of the citizen if relevant, including his or
    her age, physical stature, minority status, and level of sophistication.&nbsp;

    that he went to go inside the townhouse through the back door because he did
    not think he needed to remain in the backyard, as no police officer was talking
    directly to him.&nbsp; According to the accused, it was only when Cst. O’Toole
    physically prevented him from going into the townhouse that “things changed”
    and he did not think he could leave.</span></p>

    in those circumstances, might well interpret that inquiry as a tactical demand

    reaching this conclusion I have tried to take a realistic appraisal of the

    given that one of the investigations they were pursuing concerned activities
    and/or individuals potentially in the Dixon backyard; (2) the nature and
    duration of the police interaction with the accused and his friends, including
    how the police addressed the accused and the other young men in the Dixon
    backyard, and telling one of the other young men to keep his hands in front of
    his body; and (3) the young age and visible minority status of the accused and
    his friends, and the comparatively slight physical stature of the accused.</span></p>

    accused and the police officers describe the key events at this critical
    juncture differently, but I am satisfied that, even on the testimony of the
    police officers, which I accept, the accused was detained at that point in
    time, namely, when Cst. O’Toole asked the accused about the contents of his
    bag.&nbsp; The police were not able to effect a physical detention of the
    accused at that point in time, however, because as soon as the inquiry was made
    by Cst. O’Toole, the accused fled from the backyard.&nbsp; But, in my opinion,
    it was at that point that, as a matter of law, the accused was detained.&nbsp;

    and Cst. Teatero about the “nervous” activities of the accused and his
    movements in “blading” his body to keep his bag concealed from the officers,
    led Cst. Teatero to believe that the accused was exhibiting the characteristics
    of “an armed gunman,” and caused him to have reason to believe there was a gun
    in the accused’s bag.&nbsp; In these circumstances, the police officers were
    lawfully entitled, if not obliged by common sense and the compelling interests
    of public and personal safety, to briefly perform a “pat down” or frisk search
    of the accused and his bag to determine if he was indeed armed, and to remove
    any imminent threat caused by the presence of a weapon.&nbsp; Again, the only
    reason no such search was conducted was because the accused immediately fled

    justified in pushing open the accused’s apartment door in order to see whether
    the object was, as suspected, a weapon.&nbsp; Importantly, expressly applying <i>R.

    39-41, re-affirmed the common law police power to conduct a “safety search”
    when an officer believes “on reasonable grounds that his or her safety, or the

    searches may properly be conducted, as the court observed in <i>R. v. MacDonald</i>,

    &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>There is
    some question whether the decision in <i>R. v. MacDonald</i> changes the legal
    threshold for lawful police “safety searches” from the traditional “reasonable
    suspicion” standard to a higher standard akin to the search warrant requirement
    of “reasonable and probable grounds.”&nbsp; I do not read the <i>R. v.
    MacDonald</i> decision as having such an effect.&nbsp; It is important to
    recall that, from its judicial inception in <i>Terry v. Ohio</i>, 392 U.S. 1,
    88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968), the courts in the United States and Canada have long applied,
    in somewhat different language, the standard of “reasonable suspicion” to
    measure the constitutional permissibility of such “stop and frisk”
    searches.&nbsp; The significantly higher standard of “reasonable and probable
    grounds” has never been the required threshold, for the sound functional reason
    that it would render such searches legally redundant and practically
    useless.&nbsp; If a police officer possessed reasonable and probable grounds to
    believe a suspect was armed and dangerous, the suspect would invariably be
    arrested, not merely detained, and would be physically searched as incident to
    that arrest.&nbsp; There would be little point in the existence of the police
    “safety search” power, which has been clearly recognized in the appellate court
    jurisprudence, if it provided no search powers beyond those already recognized
    as being incident to an arrest.&nbsp; Moreover, if police officers are to
    lawfully conduct investigations in relation to detained (but not arrested)
    suspects, it only stands to reason that they must be given the lawful means of
    taking the necessary steps to protect themselves and others during the course
    of such investigations.&nbsp; Otherwise, the police would be needlessly placed
    at serious risk in the performance of their important public duties.&nbsp; See: <i>R. v. Chehil</i>, </span><a

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>In <i>R. v. Mann</i> and its
    progeny the courts have confirmed the existence of the police power to detain
    individuals for investigative purposes and, where the police have “reasonable
    grounds” to suspect the detainee is armed and dangerous, to conduct a brief
    frisk or pat-down search to ensure their own safety and the safety of the
    public as they conduct such investigations.&nbsp; In my view, <i>R. v.
    MacDonald</i> is but an application of that well-established warrantless search
    power in a particular factual context, namely, where the search involves police
    entry of the confines of a private residence, where there is an increased
    expectation of privacy.&nbsp; See: <i>R. v. Zargar</i>, </span><a

    paras. 29-32.&nbsp;Indeed, in <i>R. v. MacDonald</i>, the Supreme Court
    expressly purports to apply <i>R. v. Mann</i> in this factual context – not
    overrule it (or the many subsequent judgments that have clarified and applied
    it).&nbsp; The confusion in relation to this legal threshold has arisen, it
    seems to me, from the use of the phrase “reasonable grounds” to describe the
    threshold of “reasonable suspicion” or “articulable cause,” as this same
    terminology is also used to describe the higher threshold of “reasonable and
    probable grounds.”&nbsp; See:<i> R. v. Mann</i>, at paras. 33-35, 40-45,
    63-64.&nbsp; Accordingly, it is important to recall that, in this particular
    context, the term “reasonable grounds” is used to describe a threshold of
    reasonable suspicion, not a threshold of reasonable probability. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

    friends testified about how they were regularly and frequently stopped by the
    police, for no reason, at all hours of the day or night, whenever they were
    walking through the housing complex, and harassed for their identification,
    asked about whether they had anything they should not have, and physically
    frisk-searched.&nbsp; Sometimes the police would lift up their shirts as part
    of this search.&nbsp; Sometimes this happened more than once a day.&nbsp;
    Sometimes the stop would result in a radio call by the police to check up on
    the person stopped.&nbsp; None of these witnesses were ever given any reason
    for these stops.&nbsp; Sometimes the police would write down information on
    papers.&nbsp; These witnesses testified, generally, that they did not walk away
    from these intimidating interactions with the police as they assumed the police
    would just detain them longer, or use force against them.&nbsp; These witnesses
    testified that they were never charged with any offences as a result of these
    interactions, and they assumed these interactions took place just because they
    were young black males walking around in a high-crime area.</span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>In May of 2012, the accused was no
    longer living in the Atkinson Housing Co-operative.&nbsp; However, he testified
    that, years earlier, when he did live in that housing complex, he too was
    occasionally stopped by the police and questioned.&nbsp; Indeed, the accused
    testified that every time he saw the police in that complex, they stopped
    him.&nbsp; On these occasions, he would be asked where he lived, and sometimes
    he would be frisk searched.&nbsp; According to the accused, he did not think
    that he could just walk away from the police as he had heard about people being
    beaten up by the police.&nbsp; Mr. Le testified that, indeed, on one occasion
    he had been beaten up, along with two other young men, during a “police
    raid.”&nbsp; The accused also testified that, more recently, when he returned
    to the Atkinson Housing Co-operative to visit a friend, he would be similarly
    stopped by the police and questioned.&nbsp; On these occasions, the accused did
    not recall being searched, but he recalled that he was asked for his
    identification and the police took notes of their interactions.</span></p>

    lead this body of evidence, over the objection of the Crown, for the reasons
    advanced by defence counsel at the time the admissibility of this evidence was
    questioned.&nbsp; In the final analysis, however, I found this body of evidence
    unhelpful in resolving the important issues in this case. </span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>First, none of these defence
    witnesses, including the accused, suggested that the three police officers
    involved in the present case (i.e. Csts. O’Toole, Reid and Teatero) were in any
    way involved in any of these alleged earlier incidents.&nbsp; Accordingly, even
    assuming that all of these alleged earlier incidents involved unconstitutional
    misconduct on the part of the officers involved, none of that alleged
    misconduct can be properly attributed to the three police officers who were
    involved in the circumstances of the present case.</span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Second, most of this evidence
    struck me as manufactured.&nbsp; While the testimony of these defence witnesses
    was strikingly similar in content, as if they had practiced their evidence in
    this regard together, it was steeped in the generic description of non-specific
    historical events that allegedly took place with frequency and regularity over
    a period of years.&nbsp; No specific dates were ever identified.&nbsp; No
    specific police officers were ever mentioned.&nbsp; Factual details that might identify
    a particular incident and distinguish it from another were entirely
    absent.&nbsp; In short, I found this body of evidence quite unpersuasive. </span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Third, in the present case, at the
    end of the day, there is simply no evidentiary basis in support of any potential
    argument that these three police officers were engaged, consciously or
    unconsciously, in any exercise of racial profiling.&nbsp; The three police
    officers who were involved in the investigative activities in the present case
    were not drawn into the Dixon backyard to communicate with the young men
    present in that location because there were four black males and one Asian male
    in that backyard.&nbsp; The evidence is clear that the three police officers
    were directed to the Dixon backyard for perfectly justified and appropriate
    investigative purposes.&nbsp; The racial composition of the young men in the
    Dixon backyard was no more relevant to the investigative aims of the three
    police officers than the racial composition of the three-man investigative team
    of police officers.</span></p>

    evening of May 25, 2012, the three TPS officers were directed by security
    guards working in the Atkinson Housing Co-operative to the Dixon
    backyard.&nbsp; The officers attended at that location for valid and proper
    investigative reasons.&nbsp; When they arrived at that specific address, the
    officers found five young males talking in the backyard area.&nbsp; The
    officers were lawfully entitled, pursuant to the implied licence doctrine, to
    enter this backyard through the open gateway in order to speak to any potential
    occupier of the townhouse.&nbsp; The only occupier of the premises in the
    backyard, Mr. Dixon, never asked the police officers to leave.</span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>While the police were talking to
    some of the young men, including Mr. Dixon, the accused began acting nervously
    and started “blading” his body in order to conceal from the police the bag on
    his hip area – a bag that contained a fully-loaded semi-automatic
    firearm.&nbsp; At that point, the police had reasonable grounds to believe that
    the accused was armed and dangerous.&nbsp; </span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>Shortly thereafter, the accused
    was effectively detained by the police when he was asked about the contents of
    that bag.&nbsp; This was not an arbitrary detention, however, as the police had
    reasonable grounds to believe he was armed.&nbsp; Yet, before the accused could
    be physically detained, subjected to a brief frisk search for weapons, and
    advised of his constitutional rights, he ran away.&nbsp; </span></p>

lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;color:black'>The police gave chase, eventually
    tackled him to the ground and struggled to gain physical control over
    him.&nbsp; During this frantic struggle, the accused reached for his partially
    opened bag, and a police officer observed the butt end of the handgun and felt
    the handle of the gun in the bag.&nbsp; When the accused was eventually subdued
    and arrested, the search incident to that arrest revealed the loaded firearm in
    the accused’s bag and, later, revealed his secretive possession of 13 grams of
    crack cocaine.&nbsp; These searches were reasonable and conducted in accordance
