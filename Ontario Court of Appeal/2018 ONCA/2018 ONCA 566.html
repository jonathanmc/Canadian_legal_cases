    entered on May 24, 2017, with reasons reported at 2017 ONSC 3207, and the
    sentence imposed on August 16, 2017 by Justice R.J. Harper of the Superior
    Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=StrongUnderline>Overview </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of two counts each of sexual touching and
    invitation to sexual touching. The offences involve his then nine-year-old
    granddaughter. He was sentenced to 30 months, concurrent on each count. He
    appeals from his convictions and sentence. At the conclusion of the oral
    hearing, we dismissed both appeals with reasons to follow. These are our
    reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant’s parents had an acrimonious separation, after which her
    father had access to the children on weekends. He would stay at his parents’
    home when he exercised access. This is where the offences occurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant’s evidence in-chief was introduced pursuant to s. 715.1
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em> by way of video.  Among other things, the
    complainant testified to the following incidents: </p>
  <h6 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> She was standing between the
    appellant’s legs while he was seated in a chair. The appellant told the
    complainant to give him a kiss, after which he placed both hands on her cheeks,
    moved her face so that her mouth went to his lips, and inserted his tongue into
    her mouth. The complainant testified that while her grandfather’s tongue was in
    her mouth, her grandmother (“T.B.”), returned from her volunteer work and
    walked into the room. T.B. yelled at the appellant and slapped him. </span></h6>
  <h6 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>The next day, the appellant told
    the complainant that he wanted to marry her and attempted to kiss her again.
    This time the complainant slapped him. </span></h6>
  <h6 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>On another occasion, the
    appellant and complainant were in a computer room at the grandparents’ home.
    The appellant told the complainant to remove her clothes. She was afraid and
    complied. He also removed his clothes. The complainant testified that the
    appellant inspected her by squatting down to examine her “private” and “boobs”.
    He said that she looked “good” and “sexy”. He grabbed her vaginal area with one
    hand and his penis with the other. The complainant described how the appellant
    held his penis like a “sausage” and “wiggled it”, “like a worm”.  </span></h6>
  <h6 style='text-align:justify;'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>The final incident occurred in
    the kitchen. The appellant asked the complainant to remove her pants and she
    complied. He also removed his pants. He squatted to examine her body and asked
    her if she wanted to have sex. She said no. He was touching his penis and
    moving closer to the complainant when T.B. entered the kitchen and yelled at
    him. </span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, who had the benefit of viewing the complainant’s video
    statement and seeing her cross-examined, concluded that the child was credible
    and her evidence reliable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He also had the opportunity to observe the complainant’s grandmother, T.B.,
    testify for the defence. She was an important defence witness because, among
    other things, she denied ever witnessing any inappropriate contact between the
    appellant and complainant. If the trial judge believed T.B., or had a doubt
    arising from her evidence, then the child complainant’s version of events would
    have been very badly shaken.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the trial judge rejected T.B.’s credibility, concluding: “I
    find that [T.B.] is not a credible witness. … I do not accept [T.B.’s] denial
    that she never observed her husband kissing [the complainant], with his tongue,
    nor her denial that she observed [the complainant] and her husband naked from
    the waist down on another occasion.” The trial judge gave several reasons for
    rejecting T.B.’s credibility. The first ground of appeal relates to those reasons.
     </p>
  <p class=StrongUnderline>First Ground of Appeal
    from Conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant maintains that the trial judge erred in how he approached
    his credibility findings relating to T.B. We disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We start with the observation that, absent palpable and overriding
    error, the trial judge’s credibility findings are owed strong deference by this
    court: <em>R. v. Sanderson</em>, 2017 ONCA 470, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 129, at para.
    18. We see no such error. We will briefly touch upon each alleged problem. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge was wrong to rely upon
    a discrepancy in the evidence between T.B. and another witness in making his
    credibility assessment. That discrepancy relates to how often the appellant
    would accompany T.B. on her volunteer work. Even if the trial judge were wrong
    to note the discrepancy in the two witnesses’ evidence as reducing their
    credibility, we do not agree that he rested his finding about the credibility
    and reliability of T.B.’s evidence on that discrepancy. Rather, his focus was
    on the fact that T.B. admitted that the appellant did not accompany her at
    least 20 percent of the time. Accordingly, her testimony that she was
    “absolutely sure” that the appellant was <em>never</em> alone with the
    complainant was undermined because she “could not know if [the complainant] was
    ever alone with [the appellant] during the times when [he] was not with her.” It
    was open to the trial judge to come to this common sense conclusion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred by emphatically stating that
    her son <em>never</em> took naps when the children were in the house. It was
    open to the trial judge to find that, given T.B.’s work schedule, she “could
    not have known if [her son] ever slept while the children were awake”. Although
    the appellant submits that T.B. was not as emphatic as the trial judge
    suggested, she testified that she would “bet [her] life on it that he did not
    have a nap when he was looking after his kids”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge erred in how he dealt with a
    statement T.B. had given to the police, where she acknowledged that she had
    once seen the complainant and appellant alone in the computer room. T.B. told
    the police that she “just asked” the appellant what he was doing alone in the
    dark with the complainant. The appellant is said to have told T.B. that he was
    showing the complainant the lights from a radio he had in the room. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant maintains that the trial judge erred in characterizing T.B.’s request
    to know what her husband and their grandchild were doing in a dark room
    together as a “demand” as opposed to a request. We do not agree. Bearing in
    mind the context, it was entirely open for the trial judge to characterize the
    evidence in this way. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge reversed the onus of proof when he
    referred to the fact that, although the appellant had told T.B. that he was
    showing the complainant lights from a radio, that there was actually no
    evidence that those radio lights were on. We disagree. There was no evidence
    that the lights were on. The trial judge was simply making an observation that
    there was no evidence of radio lights. This did not reverse the burden of
    proof. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the appellant claims that the trial judge erred by misapprehending evidence,
    when he said that T.B. testified that the appellant was “never ever” alone with
    the complainant. The appellant says that her evidence should have been
    understood as meaning never alone in a room with the complainant. We disagree. The
    witness testified that they had “never been alone anywhere, ever”. It was open
    to the trial judge to come to the conclusion he did about what T.B. meant when
    she said the appellant was never alone with the complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    it does not assist the appellant to say that T.B. meant the appellant and
    complainant were never alone in a room together, as T.B.’s own comments to the
    police, about seeing the appellant and complainant alone in the computer room
    together, belie this suggestion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s treatment of T.B.’s evidence
    regarding a police statement where she said: “She told Detective [x] that she
    could never imagine [the appellant] kissing [the complainant]. However, she
    could imagine [the appellant] kissing his adult grandchildren who were
    beautiful”. The trial judge found this comment “disturbing on so many levels”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge took T.B.’s comments out of context. He
    says that T.B. meant that she could not imagine the appellant passionately
    kissing a child as opposed to an adult. We do not agree. Given what she told
    the police, it was open to the trial judge to come to the interpretation he
    did. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in his approach to T.B.’s credibility or her evidence. </p>
  <p class=StrongUnderline>Second Ground of Appeal
    from Conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge did not conduct a proper analysis of the
    inconsistencies between the complainant’s and her mother’s evidence regarding
    the circumstances surrounding the original disclosure of the offences. He maintains
    that these inconsistencies give rise to an inference of potential collusion
    between the witnesses. We do not agree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge carefully addressed the inconsistencies in the evidence, and he confronted
    and resolved the allegation of collusion. We see no error in his approach. </p>
  <p class=StrongUnderline>Appeal from Sentence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also seeks leave to appeal his 30 month sentence. The appeal rests on
    a fresh evidence application. The evidence is said to have been discovered
    shortly after the sentence was imposed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant’s mother’s victim impact statement, filed at the sentencing
    hearing, described what she perceived as the impact of the offences on her
    daughter. The statement was signed and dated by the mother. The complainant
    then placed a short handwritten note after the mother’s signature. The note
    refers to the fact that the complainant was “having a hard time telling [her]
    feelings outload [<em>sic</em>] and on paper”. It says that she had read her
    mother’s victim impact statement “about what my life is like now” and “agreed
    with it”. The complainant signed and dated her brief comment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh evidence consists of a lawyer’s affidavit explaining that, in light of
    information that was discovered shortly after sentence was imposed, the lawyer interviewed
    the complainant. The complainant told the lawyer that, although she recalled
    her mother reading something to her, she could not recall whether her mother
    read her the entire statement.  The complainant said that she simply copied onto
    the page a comment that her mother had prepared for her. The complainant told
    the lawyer that she was concerned that her mother may become angry if she did
    not copy out what had been written.  The complainant disputed a good deal of
    what her mother had written. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not admit the fresh evidence for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    burden is on the applicant to establish that the fresh evidence should be
    received on appeal: <em>R. v. Palmer</em>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, at p. 775; <em>R.
    v. Sipos</em>, 2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at paras. 29-30. He has failed
    to do so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the hearsay nature of the evidence were to be ignored, the fresh evidence
    would be inadmissible because it cannot “reasonably be expected to have
    affected the result”: <em>Sipos</em>, at para. 29. At its highest, the fresh
    evidence only supports a finding that the complainant does not agree with everything
    her mother said about the impact that the offence has had on her. Even if the
    complainant’s comments after sentencing had been available at the time of
    sentencing, the mother’s victim impact statement – in its entirety – would have
    still been before the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the reasons for sentence make reference to the complainant’s brief handwritten agreement
    with the contents of her mother’s statement, the sentencing judge’s reasons
    only make fleeting reference to that fact. The reasons he gives for arriving at
    the disposition appealed from focus on the inherent and indisputable seriousness
    of offences of this nature and the fact that this particular one involved a
    significant breach of trust. As noted by the trial judge, the appellant “robbed
    his young grandchild of her sexual innocence”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
    in context, there is no indication that the victim impact statement had an
    effect on sentence. With or without the victim impact statement, the
    appellant’s sentence would have been the same. The fresh evidence would not
    have affected the result. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the applicant has failed to show due diligence. He did not challenge the victim
    impact statement at trial. He did not seek leave to cross-examine either the
    mother or the child before sentence was imposed. Although trial counsel
    suggested that some of the things said in the victim impact statement were
    “contrary to the [complainant’s] testimony … at trial”, she did not wish to get
    into the minutiae. Trial counsel was content, properly in our view, to base her
    position on the known and undeniable impact of offences of this nature on
    children: <em>R. v. D.D. </em>(2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471 (Ont. C.A.), at
    paras. 35-38. This was a considered and tactical decision made at the time of
    sentencing and should not be second-guessed after sentence has been imposed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a fit sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction appeal is dismissed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application to admit fresh evidence is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted
    and the sentence appeal is dismissed. </p>
