    judge or justice having jurisdiction in the judicial district where the
    proceedings will take place.</p>

    is in the interest of the proper administration of judge, the judge or justice
    shall consider </p>

    the reporting of offences and the participation of victims and witnesses in the
    criminal justice process;</p>
  <p style='

    of witnesses under the age of 18 years in all proceedings;</p>

text-align:justify'>(c) the ability of the witness to give
    a full and candid account of the acts complained of if the order were not made;</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify'>(d) whether the witness needs the order
    for their security or to protect them from intimidation or retaliation;</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify'>(e) the protection of justice system
    participants who are involved in the proceedings;</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify'>(f) whether effective alternatives to
    the making of the proposed order are available in the circumstances;</p>
  <p style='

    shall, if no such order is made, state, by reference to the circumstances of
    the case, the reason for not making an order.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span lang=EN-US>(a) Alleged failure to understand
    that a person can consent while “blacked out” </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Among other things, the complainant was able to
    recall that at one point she realized that the appellant’s penis was in her
    mouth and she was choking on it. She could not recall how the <em>fellatio</em> began. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge correctly stated the law, that
    consent to sexual activity must be contemporaneous with that activity and that,
    in order to consent, a person must be conscious, with an “operating mind,
    capable of granting, revoking or withholding consent to each and every sexual
    act”: <em>R. v. J.A., </em>2011 SCC 28, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 440 at para. 44. The
    trial judge concluded that, as it related to the act of <em>fellatio</em>, the
    complainant could not have consented because she had “blacked out”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant claims that the trial judge erred
    by failing to appreciate the difference between “blacking out” and a state of
    unconsciousness. He defines the term “black out” as a period of time for which
    a person – who was conscious – has no memory. The appellant emphasizes that the
    Crown also seemed to approach the term in this way. The appellant says that the
    distinction between a state of unconsciousness and a black out are important
    because a person who has simply lost their memory may have consented to sexual
    activity: <em>R. v. Esau </em>(1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.).
    Accordingly, he contends that the trial judge erred by concluding that because
    the complainant “blacked out” she did not consent. We disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s entire submission is predicated
    on the singular definition he offers to the term “blacked out”. We do not agree
    that this is a legal term of art that admits of only one definition. What is
    important is how the term is used. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge in this case demonstrated his
    keen understanding of the difference between being unconscious and simply
    losing one’s memory. He specifically adverted to this difference: “I accept
    that because of her level of intoxication, there were periods where she
    ‘blacked out’ and there were periods where she could not remember what was said
    or done”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge used the term “blacked
    out” to describe the complainant’s condition when the appellant’s penis was
    originally placed in her mouth, he was clearly conveying his conclusion that
    the complainant was unconscious when the <em>fellatio</em> began, rendering her
    incapable of consent. The following passages from the reasons for judgment make
    this clear: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The accused also alleges that the complainant
    performed oral sex on him. For the reasons already expressed, I have rejected
    the accused’s evidence on point and have accepted the complainant’s evidence
    that, after having blacked out, <em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>she woke
    up with the accused’s penis in her mouth</span></u></em></span>. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The complainant simply cannot be held to have
    consented to the act. It follows from my acceptance of the complainant’s
    evidence that she <em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>woke up with the accused’s
    penis in her mouth, that the sex act began when she was blacked out.</span></u></em> As such, it cannot be said that at the time the accused initiated the activity,
    the complainant possessed the requisite “conscious, operating mind, capable of
    granting, revoking or withholding consent”, as required by the Supreme Court’s
    decision in <em>R. v. J.A. </em></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These passages reveal the trial judge’s factual
    conclusion that the complainant was in a state of unconsciousness when the <em>fellatio</em> started and only came to a state of consciousness part way through. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span lang=EN-US>(b) Alleged failure to consider
    what happened while the complainant was “blacked out” </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant acknowledges that if he fails on
    the previous ground of appeal, then he cannot succeed in showing that the trial
    judge erred by failing to consider whether the complainant might have consented
    to the <em>fellatio</em>. Given our finding that the trial judge concluded that
    the complainant was unconscious when the appellant’s penis originally went into
    her mouth, she could not have consented and this ground of appeal also fails. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span lang=EN-US>(c) Alleged misunderstanding of
    what constitutes a lack of consent </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant testified about the pain she

    assuming that the complainant would not have consented to vaginal intercourse
    because of the pain it caused. According to the appellant, it was pure

    things she would not usually do that night, would not have consented to
    intercourse from behind. We disagree. </span></p>

    bruises the day following the sexual assault. She sent a text message to her
    friend, reflecting the fact that she was “covered in bruises”. She also told
    others that she had bruising. However, the nurse practitioner who examined the
    complainant after the sexual assault did not make any note of bruising. </span></p>

    and found that the complainant was simply wrong about when the visible bruises
    emerged. He further held that in the absence of medical evidence about when the
    bruising would have become visible, he was unable to make an adverse finding of
    credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in his approach to this evidence. He maintains that the lack of bruising was a
    “pivotal issue at trial” because it showed that the complainant was not being
    truthful. Combined with the fact that the complainant sent a text message to
    her friend shortly after the events in the appellant’s room, referencing her
    belief that she had “made a mistake”, the appellant argues that the
    complainant’s suggestion of bruising is a fabrication to attempt to justify her
    actions. We disagree that the trial judge erred. </span></p>

    assault. This was confirmed in the medical examination. Although visible
    bruises were not seen during the nurse’s examination, the complainant’s mother
    saw bruising three days after the assault. The trial judge found that, although
    the complainant’s evidence about the timing of the bruising undermined her
    reliability, it did not undermine her credibility. It was open to the trial
    judge to come to this conclusion, particularly in light of the fact that the
    complainant testified about how sore she was after the assault and the medical
    practitioner’s confirmation of this evidence. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    by treating his evidence that the complainant did not smell of alcohol as “fundamentally
    and significantly” undermining his credibility. The appellant maintains that it
    was unreasonable to infer that the complainant would have smelled of alcohol simply
    because of the amount of alcohol she consumed. Accordingly, it was unfair to use
    his evidence on this point to impugn his credibility. We disagree. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was entirely reasonable to infer that the
    complainant would have smelled of alcohol. She was not challenged on her
    evidence about having consumed, in addition to other alcohol, six shots of
    vodka and a quarter bottle of Sour Puss. Other witnesses at trial testified about
    her inebriation. Her text messaging immediately following the sexual assault
    further demonstrates a high level of intoxication. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was open to the trial judge to conclude that
    the appellant’s credibility was shaken by denying the obvious: the complainant
    was highly intoxicated and would have smelled of alcohol. Indeed, in light of
    all of the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to, “reject the accused’s
    evidence that he could not see, smell, or sense any indication that the
    complainant had been drinking.” We do not consider this a matter of “judicial
    notice”. It reflects nothing more than a common sense inference that was open
    to the trial judge to draw from all of the evidence. </span></p>

    C.C.C,. (3d) 168 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 177. Although we agree that on two

    ground of appeal. </span></p>

    did not feel badly about what had happened, and left the complainant like a
    “discarded tissue”. This comment should not have been made. Even so, the

    on. </span></p>

    Accordingly, he argues that he had a lesser form of <em>mens rea </em>than full
    knowledge and the sentencing judge failed to discount his sentence accordingly.
    In addition, he says that the fact that the appellant asked during the assault
    whether the complainant was enjoying herself (to which he received no answer),
    should have factored into the sentence imposed. </span></p>
