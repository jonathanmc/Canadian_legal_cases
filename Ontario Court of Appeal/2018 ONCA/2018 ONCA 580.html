lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted of the sexual
    assault of his patient during a medical examination. He asks us to admit fresh
    evidence on appeal, and submits that there is a strong possibility that the
    verdict would have been different had the jury heard the fresh evidence.</span></p>

    for admissibility. The fresh evidence “could reasonably be expected to have
    affected the verdict:” </span><em>R. v. Truscott</em><span lang=EN-US>, </span>2007
    ONCA 575, 225 C.C.C. (3d) 321, at <span lang=EN-US>para. 245. As a result a new
    trial is required.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The evidence at trial</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant A.E attended the appellant’s
    office for a doctor’s note demanded by her employer as she had missed work
    because of back pain. Her sister, C.E. went with her to the appointment but
    waited in the reception area.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant testified that during her
    appointment, the appellant asked her if she would go out with him. She thought
    he was joking, and responded, “who wouldn’t want to go out with a doctor, and
    he’s rich, right?” The complainant testified that he hugged her, kissed her
    cheek and neck, touched her breast and unsuccessfully tried to put his hand
    down the front of her pants. She said he rubbed her crotch area and stuck his
    tongue in her mouth. He exposed his genitals and tried to force her body into
    contact with them. When it became clear she was not agreeing to the contact the
    normal medical appointment resumed. He asked her to go dancing with him and she
    agreed. He whispered to her that this was to be their secret. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant’s sister C.E. testified that
    A.E. came out of the doctor’s office a changed person. Before the appointment,
    A.E. was happy and talkative and they were joking around. After the appointment
    A.E. did not seem herself, she did not look right. She seemed nervous and
    “spaced out”. C.E. testified that A.E.’s face was pale and her eyes were watery
    and red, as if she was about to cry. This was unusual as she had not seen her
    sister cry since she was 14 years old. C.E. testified that A.E. then described
    sexual assaults she had suffered in the appellant’s consulting room and they
    discussed going to the police. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span

  <p class=MsoListNumber>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it
    could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not

  <p class=MsoListNumber>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive
    or potentially decisive issue in the trial.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable
    of belief, and </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with
    the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    criteria embrace three components: admissibility under the governing rules of
    evidence; cogency and whether the proposed evidence bears upon a decisive or
    potentially decisive issue at trial, is reasonably capable of belief, and could
    reasonably be expected to have affected the verdict at trial; and due
    diligence.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[7]</span></sup></span></sup></a> The first two
    – admissibility and cogency – are preconditions to the admissibility of the
    fresh evidence on appeal. On the other hand, due diligence is not a condition
    precedent to admissibility, and assumes importance only when the other
    components have been met. It asks whether the explanation offered, if any, for
    the failure to adduce the evidence at trial should affect the admissibility of
    the evidence on appeal.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup><span

font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[8]</span></sup></span></sup></a> The
    explanation offered for the failure to adduce evidence at trial, or in some
    cases the absence of any explanation, can result in the exclusion of evidence
    that would otherwise be admissible on appeal.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown opposes the admission of the fresh evidence on the ground that it is not
    capable of belief and because it could have been tendered at trial with the
    exercise of reasonable diligence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown points out that the witnesses wrote letters outlining their recollection
    some 26 months after the events and agreed there was nothing remarkable about
    the events they described seeing. They had all known the appellant from
    previous contacts, some as patients. Their affidavits were sworn some 45 months
    after the alleged events. The Crown suggests that there was a hint of collusion
    surrounding the gathering of this evidence and argues that there are
    inconsistencies amongst the fresh evidence witnesses as to locations where the
    two women were seen. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown says there is “good reason to believe the testimony of these witnesses is
    a wholesale concoction personally orchestrated by the appellant.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. Here four independent citizens, with no criminal records and with
    no connections to the offence, have sworn affidavits attesting to what they saw.
    They did not waver under cross examination by the Crown. It strains credulity
    to believe that these individuals would swear false affidavits and obstruct
    justice to support an individual with whom they were not closely connected. This
    is not evidence from a participant in the crime, or from recanting witnesses
    who have changed their evidence many times: <em>R. v. Kassa, </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>2010 ONCA 140</span></em><em>; R v. Allen</em>, 2018
    ONCA 498. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Due diligence</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel was discharged after conviction but before sentencing. The fresh
    evidence came to light as new counsel sought character evidence for sentencing
    purposes. The fresh evidence could have been introduced at trial if trial
    counsel had been aware of it. The failure to adduce this evidence did not arise
    from a tactical decision. The failure to discover this evidence and adduce it
    at trial does not outweigh the impact of the potentially significant probative
    value of this evidence. This prosecution depended heavily on the jury’s
    assessment of A.E.’s and C.E.’s credibility. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    recognize that the need for finality means that fresh evidence is not often
    admitted on appeal. As Watt J.A. noted in<em> Allen</em>, at para. 90: “[a]dmitting
    fresh evidence on appeal necessarily undermines legitimate finality
    expectations. This negative consequence can only be justified if the overall
    integrity of the process is furthered by the reception of the fresh evidence.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is one of those cases. The proposed fresh evidence is reasonably capable of
    belief, bears on a decisive issue at trial, and when considered with the other
    evidence at trial could be expected to have affect the verdict. The interests
    of justice require a new trial where the credibility of all of the evidence can
    be assessed, and we so order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh evidence is admitted, the conviction is quashed and a new trial is
    ordered.  </p>
