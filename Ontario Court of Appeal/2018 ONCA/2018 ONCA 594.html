  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was charged with the abduction
    and violent sexual assault of two different women in 1986. He fled to the
    United States of America, in violation of the terms of his bail. A Canada-wide
    warrant was issued for his arrest. He assumed a false identity. In 1987, he was
    charged in the United States with assault, aggravated robbery and kidnapping of
    a third woman. In 1988, he was sentenced to 52 years imprisonment in the United
    States. At the time, there was no extradition treaty that would have allowed
    Canadian authorities to bring the respondent to Canada to stand trial while he
    was serving his sentence in the United States.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2000, Toronto police were advised that the
    respondent was eligible for parole in May 2013. In 2003, an amendment was made
    to the relevant extradition treaty which would have permitted Canadian
    authorities to seek temporary extradition to proceed with the trial of the
    Ontario charges but no such efforts were made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In August 2015, Toronto police were advised that
    the respondent was being released from prison and would be returned to Canada.
    On October 26, 2015 he was deported back to Canada and was arrested on arrival.
    His trial was scheduled to begin July 31, 2017 and be completed, within a
    period less than two years after his return to Ontario. However, the charges
    were stayed on the respondent’s application alleging that his right to trial
    within a reasonable time had been violated. The Crown appeals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We agree with the Crown’s argument that these
    charges should not have been stayed, and that all of the delay caused by the
    respondent’s flight in violation of his bail conditions should be treated as
    defence delay. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Trial judge’s reasons</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that the Crown ought to
    have sought the temporary surrender of the respondent pursuant to the amendment
    to the extradition treaty between Canada and the United States. She accordingly
    characterized the 12 and one half year period between April 30, 2003 when the
    amendment came into force and October 26, 2015 when the respondent was returned
    to Canada as Crown delay “vastly beyond the timeframe articulated in </span><em>Jordan</em><span
lang=EN-US>” and also “unreasonable” under the </span><em>Morin</em><span
lang=EN-US> framework.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not have the benefit of the

lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court of Canada held, in both </span><em>Cody</em><span
lang=EN-US> and in </span><em>R. v. Jordan</em><a
href="https://nextcanada.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&amp;pubNum=6407&amp;serNum=2039329269&amp;originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;contextData=(sc.Search)"><span

lang=EN-US>, </span>[2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, <span lang=EN-US>that in order to
    determine whether there has been unreasonable delay, “defence delay” is to be
    deducted from the overall period of delay – from charge to the anticipated end
    of trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><em>Cody, </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>at paras. 26-28, </span></em><span lang=EN-US>the Supreme
    Court elaborated on the notion of defence delay and explained it is “delay that
    is caused solely or directly by the conduct of the defence” and that the
    analysis of defence delay is “intended to prevent the defence from benefitting
    from “its own delay-causing action or inaction” (citation omitted). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court said further, at para. 30:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The only
    deductible defence delay under this component is, therefore, that which: (1) is
    solely or directly caused by the accused person; and (2) flows from defence
    action that is illegitimate insomuch as it is not taken to respond to the
    charges. As we said in </span><em>Jordan</em><span lang=EN-US>, the most
    straightforward example is “[d]eliberate and calculated defence tactics aimed
    at causing delay, which include frivolous applications and requests.” [Citation
    omitted.] </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Supreme Court then went on to describe
    illegitimate defence delay, at paras. 32-34. Defence action may not be
    legitimate in the context of a s. 11(b) application if “it is designed to delay
    or if it exhibits marked inefficiency or marked indifference toward delay.” The
    defence is not allowed to “engage in illegitimate conduct and then have it
    count towards the Jordan ceiling.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent admitted to Toronto police that
    his express purpose in fleeing was to avoid capture and prosecution. The terms
    of his bail required he remain within the jurisdiction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The delay from the time the charges were laid
    until the time the respondent was returned to Canada was illegitimate defence
    delay. It was caused directly by the respondent, whose actions were not taken
    to respond to the charges, but were intended to frustrate them.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This case is different from others in which
    delay in pursuit of extradition proceedings has been attributed to the Crown,
    such as</span><em> R. v. MacIntosh, </em>2011 NSCA 111, 281 C.C.C. (3d) 291
    aff’d, 2013 SCC 23, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 200. In <em>MacIntosh, </em>the accused was
    lawfully living in another jurisdiction when the charges were laid. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is no suggestion that the time following
    the respondent’s return to Canada in 2015, until the anticipated end of the
    trial, was unreasonable under the </span><em>Jordan, Cody</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> or</span></em> <em>Morin</em> <span lang=EN-US>analysis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Given that the time remaining after deducting defence delay from
    total delay does not exceed the presumptive 30 month ceiling, there is no need
    to go further and consider whether exceptional circumstances amounting to
    discrete events or particular complexity require further examination. Nor is it
    necessary to consider whether the transitional exceptional circumstances
    analysis should apply: </span><em>R. v. Coulter</em><span lang=EN-US>, </span>2016
    ONCA 704, 133 O.R. (3d) 433; <em>R. v. Mallozzi</em><span lang=EN-US>, </span>2017
    ONCA 644, 390 C.R.R. (2d) 57. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly the appeal is allowed, the stay is
    set aside and the matter is returned to the Superior Court of Ontario for
    trial. Given this conclusion, it is not necessary to address the other
    arguments advanced on appeal.</span></p>
