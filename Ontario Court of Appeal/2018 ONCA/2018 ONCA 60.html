    reasons reported at 2016 ONSC 6018, 40 C.B.R. (6th) 230, and the costs order
    dated November 28, 2016, with reasons reported at 2016 ONSC 7011.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>R.A. Blair J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal arises out of a complex multi-million dollar
    commercial real estate fraud perpetrated by Norma and Ronauld Walton over the
    course of several years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants and the respondents are all victims of the fraud. Underlying
    the issues on appeal is a contest between them over who ranks in priority to
    whom in claiming against the proceeds remaining from the sale of certain
    properties acquired as part of the fraudulent scheme.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In substance, the fraudulent scheme worked in this fashion: the
    Waltons convinced the appellants and respondents, and others, to invest equally
    with them in equal-shareholder, specific-project corporations that would
    acquire, hold, renovate and maintain commercial real estate properties in the
    Toronto area. Instead of investing any significant funds of their own, however,
    the Waltons moved their investors monies in and out of the numerous
    corporations, through their own clearing house  Rose &amp; Thistle Group
    Ltd.  in a shell game designed to avoid their obligations and to further their
    own personal interests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant corporations, known as the DBDC Applicants, are
    owned and controlled by Dr. Stanley K. Bernstein. Through them, Dr. Bernstein
    invested approximately $111 million with the Waltons, in 31 projects, between September
    2010 and June 2013. In each instance, the individual DBDC applicant entered
    into an equal shareholding agreement with the Waltons with respect to the
    specific-project corporation that was to acquire and hold the particular
    property. The corporations into which the DBDC Applicants monies were to be
    invested are known as the Schedule B Companies. These investments took the
    form of equity (approximately $2.6 million), shareholder loans ($78.5 million)
    and mortgages ($29.5 million).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent, Christine DeJong Medicine Professional
    Corporation (DeJong), is owned and controlled by Dr. Christine DeJong. She
    and her husband, Michael DeJong, invested approximately $4 million with the
    Waltons  Dr. DeJong through DeJong, and Michael through his own corporations.
    Those investments were made in equal shareholder arrangements in substantially
    the same form as those entered into between the Waltons and the DBDC Applicants.
    The specific-project corporations established for the purposes of the DeJong
    investments are included in the group of companies known in the proceedings as
    the Schedule C Companies. The properties acquired by the Schedule C Companies
    are collectively known as the Schedule C Properties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The individual respondents, Dennis and Peggy Condos, and Gideon
    and Irene Levytam, made similar, but smaller investments in the same fashion. Their
    interests are also in relation to certain of the Schedule C Companies and the
    Schedule C Properties those companies acquired. The Condos claim is in
    relation to a $160,000 investment in one company. The Levytams claim a net investment
    of $337,000. Prior to the oral hearing of the appeal, the DBDC Applicants and
    the Levytams settled and the Levytams did not participate further in the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>None of the agreements contemplated third-party investors in the
    projects. None permitted the investors monies to be used for anything other
    than the purposes of the specific-project investment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The decision under appeal involves parts of Judgments and Orders
    made by Newbould J. on September 23, 2016. It comes at the back end of a
    lengthy and complex oppression remedy application commenced by the DBDC Applicants
    against the Waltons and Rose &amp; Thistle, in October 2013, pursuant to Ontarios <em>Business Corporations Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B. 16. Various Schedule C
    Companies were subsequently added as respondents.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Appointment of the Inspector</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In an endorsement dated October 7, 2013, Newbould J. concluded
    that the Waltons conduct was oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to the DBDC
    Applicants interests in the Schedule B Companies. He appointed Schonfeld Inc.
    as an Inspector over the Schedule B Companies. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Appointment of the Inspector as
    Manager</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After an initial review by the Inspector of the affairs of the
    Schedule B Companies and the conduct of the Waltons, Newbould J. confirmed his
    view that the Waltons conduct had been oppressive, and on November 5, 2013 appointed
    Schonfeld Inc. as Manager of the Schedule B Companies (and the Schedule B
    Properties held by them), thereby taking control of the Schedule B Companies
    away from the Waltons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Proceedings Before D.M. Brown
    J. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In July, 2014, after further review by the Inspector/Manager 
    referred to in more detail below  the DBDC Applicants applied to D.M. Brown J.
    (as he then was), at a hearing in the same proceedings, for various forms of
    relief. The range of relief claimed evolved over the course of the hearing. As
    Brown J. noted, this flowed from the clearer, but still incomplete, picture
    emerging from the expanded scope of the Inspectors role following the October
    2013 Order and its subsequent investigations (at paras. 213-217). By the end of
    the hearing  as outlined by Brown J. in his reasons (at paras. 214 and 240-243)
     the relief sought by the DBDC Applicants included the following:</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(a) declarations that the
    DBDC Applicants were entitled to constructive trusts where their funds could be
    traced directly into the purchase of, or the discharge of an encumbrance, with
    respect to a Schedule C Property; </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(b) damages as against the
    Waltons personally for civil fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation;</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>(c) damages against the
    Schedule C Companies, jointly and severally, for all losses suffered by the DBDC
    Applicants in respect of funds advanced to the Schedule B Companies; and</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara> (d) damages in the amount
    of $23.6 million against the Schedule C Companies, jointly and severally, for
    net proceeds diverted from the Schedule B Companies and received by the
    Schedule C Companies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application was opposed by the Waltons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the same time, DeJong (and other related companies controlled
    by the DeJongs) brought a cross-motion asking for the approval of a settlement
    it had reached with the Waltons, and opposing the DBDC Applicants constructive
    trust claim with respect to 3270 American Drive, a Schedule C Property owned by
    the Schedule C Company, United Empire Lands Ltd., in which DeJong had invested.
    Numerous Schedule C investors, including Dr. DeJong, Dennis Condos and the
    Levytams, filed affidavits in support of the Waltons position and in opposition
    to the Applicants claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 12, 2014, Brown J. released his decision. He gave full
    and detailed reasons in the course of which he made findings of fact almost
    universally against the Waltons and in favour of the DBDC Applicants and Dr. Bernstein.
    In the end, he concluded, at para. 15, that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he Waltons did not use the funds advanced to them by the
    [DBDC] Applicants as their contracts required but, instead, the Waltons
    mis-used and mis-appropriated most of the funds advanced to them, <span
class=Underline>diverting some of the funds to</span> their own personal
    benefit and <span class=Underline>the benefit of their Schedule C Companies</span>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It bears repeating that the Schedule C Companies were the
    specific-project corporations with respect to which the Waltons and other investors
     including DeJong, the Condos and the Levytams  had entered into equal shareholder
    agreements in substantially the same form as those entered into between the
    DBDC Applicants and the Waltons with respect to the Schedule B Companies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Inspector gave evidence at the hearing. Brown J. accepted the
    Inspectors evidence with respect to the net transfer of funds from Schedule
    B Companies to Rose &amp; Thistle and from Rose &amp; Thistle to Schedule C
    Companies, and made the following findings of fact:<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>the Waltons directed the
    transfer of a net $23.6 million from the Schedule B Companies accounts to a
    bank account belonging to Rose &amp; Thistle during the period from October
    2010 to October 2013;</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>during the same period, the
    Waltons directed transfers of a net $25.4 million from the Rose &amp; Thistle
    account to the Schedule C Companies;</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>in almost all cases, some of or
    all the amounts advanced to the Schedule B Companies by the DBDC Applicants were
    transferred almost immediately to the Rose &amp; Thistle account; and</span></p>
  <p class=KHeading10 style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>those transfers of funds from
    the Schedule B Companies to Rose &amp; Thistle constituted breaches of the
    agreements between the DBDC Applicants and the Waltons. These agreements required
    that each Schedule B Company, and the funds advanced to it, be used only to
    purchase, renovate and refinance the specific property owned by the Schedule B
    Company.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Waltons expert witness at the hearing had criticized the net
    transfer analysis as unhelpful on the ground that it presented only a
    snapshot tracing which, while accurate in itself, did not reflect the history
    of transfers into and out of Rose &amp; Thistle and any Schedule C Company, and
    therefore lacked precision. Brown J. rejected this evidence. He concluded that

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have read the thorough dissenting reasons of my colleague, van
    Rensburg J.A., and will address her concerns from time to time throughout these
    reasons. I pause here, however, to touch briefly on one aspect of her reasons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague devotes considerable time to developing what she
    characterizes as the DBDC Applicants late-breaking claims for damages against
    the Listed Schedule C Companies. As I understand it, she does so to emphasize
    that the record on which liability for damages is sought to be established was
    created in the context of oppression remedy proceedings in which the Listed Schedule
    C Companies were not parties and that there are no new or additional facts to
    support their participation in Ms. Waltons breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully, for purposes of resolving the appeal, I do not
    think much turns on when or how the knowing receipt and knowing assistance
    claims arrived to be dealt with by the Application Judge, and I do not propose
    to examine the record on this point in any more detail than I have done above.
    Suffice it to say, I take a different view of it than my colleague does, not
    only with regard to the extent of DeJongs participation in the proceedings
    prior to the hearing before the Application Judge, but also with respect to
    what issues were before Brown J. and either deferred or not dealt with by him
    and with respect to the need for the Listed Schedule C Companies to have been
    made parties (which Brown J. rejected) before they were. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These differences have little significance for the outcome of the
    appeal, in my opinion. No one took the position before the Application Judge,
    or before this Court, that the DBDC Applicants claim for joint and several
    damages against the Listed Schedule C Companies, based on knowing assistance
    and knowing receipt, was not properly raised at the hearing before him.<a
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[5]</span></span></span></a> Nor has it been asserted that the evidence adduced before Brown J. and the
    findings of fact made by him could not be relied upon at the hearing. Indeed,
    the Application Judge himself relied upon them to a great extent.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>More importantly, much of what underlies our disagreement with
    respect to the outcome of the appeal are the differing approaches we take to
    the utility and sufficiency of what the net transfer analysis demonstrates and
    does not demonstrate, not the context in which it was developed.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The net transfer analysis remains evidence for what it is. No one
    disputes it established a net transfer of $23.5 million out of the Schedule B
    Companies (both Brown J. and the Application Judge made that finding). I
    conclude this evidence is valuable in assessing the Listed Schedule C Companies
    knowing assistance in Ms. Waltons breach of fiduciary duty and in establishing
    damages. My colleague takes a different view. I agree that the net transfer
    analysis was not intended to, and does not, establish the flow of Schedule B
    Companies funds into any particular Listed Schedule C Company account.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[6]</span></span></span></a> My colleague concludes this is fatal to the knowing assistance claim. For the
    reasons set out below, I disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I see it, the resolution of these differences does not depend

    C Properties against which Brown J. awarded constructive trusts in favour of
    the DBDC Applicants. It also includes the Schedule C Companies that acquired
    the four Schedule C Properties over which the Application Judge granted
    constructive trusts in favour of DeJong. For ease of reference, I will refer to

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    under the doctrine of knowing receipt if the stranger receives trust property
    in his or her own personal capacity with constructive knowledge of the breach
    of trust or fiduciary duty. It is a recipient-based claim arising under the law
    of restitution: see <em>Citadel General Assurance Co. v. Lloyds Bank Canada, </em>[1997]
    3 S.C.R. 805, at para. 48.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the Application Judge that a claim for knowing
    receipt cannot be made out here. The DBDC Applicants chose not to pursue their
    rights under the tracing order granted by Brown J. They are not able to  nor
    do they seek to  demonstrate the receipt of any particular funds by any
    particular Schedule C Company other than the funds with respect to which Brown J.
    previously granted constructive trusts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    discussion about the claim for knowing assistance.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A stranger to a trust or fiduciary obligation may also be liable in
    equity on the basis of knowing assistance where the stranger, with actual
    knowledge, participates in or assists a defaulting trustee or fiduciary in a
    fraudulent and dishonest scheme. The rationale underlying this category of liability
    is that actual knowledge of and assistance in the fraudulent conduct is
    sufficient to bind the strangers conscience so as to give rise to personal
    liability: see <em>Air Canada v. M &amp; L Travel Ltd</em>., [1993] 3 S.C.R.
    787, at p. 812. Fraudulent and dishonest conduct for these purposes means the
    taking of a risk by the trustee or fiduciary to the prejudice of the
    beneficiary where the risk is known to be one which there is no right to take:
    see <em>Air Canada</em>, at pp. 815, 826.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Knowing assistance and knowing receipt are both doctrines arising
    in equity. However, there is a fundamental difference between the two types of
    liability. Knowing receipt liability is restitution-based and falls within the
    law of restitution; its essence is unjust enrichment. Knowing assistance,
    however  sometimes referred to as accessory liability  is fault-based and
    is concerned about correcting matters related to the furtherance of fraud: see <em>Gold
    v. Rosenberg</em>, at para. 41; <em>Citadel General</em>, at paras. 46-48. I
    shall return to this distinction later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Leikin Group Inc.</em>, 2011 ONCA 790, at para. 8, and again in <em>Enbridge
    Gas Distribution Inc. v. Marinaccio</em>, 2012 ONCA 650, 355 D.L.R. (4th) 333, at

  <p class=KHeading10><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'>there must be a fiduciary duty;</span></p>

    whether the Listed Schedule C Companies are to be held jointly and severally liable
    for damages arising from knowing assistance in the breach by Ms. Walton of her
    fiduciary duties to the DBDC Applicants, there are three overarching questions
    to be answered:</p>

    assistance liability, having its roots as an equitable doctrine, ought not to
    apply here?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My answer to the first and second questions is Yes and to the third
    is No. I say that for the following reasons. </p>
  <h4>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Application of the Criteria </h4>
  <h5>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fiduciary Considerations</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the Application Judge concluded, there is no issue in the
    present case that Ms. Walton owed a fiduciary duty to the DBDC Applicants and
    Dr. Bernstein, or that she fraudulently breached that duty. At para. 47 of his
    reasons, he found that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is no question that Ms. Walton knowingly breached her
    fiduciary obligations to the [DBDC Applicants] and that she knowingly took a
    risk with the money belonging to the Schedule B Companies that she had no right
    to take. Her activity in so doing was fraudulent and dishonest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No one contests this finding. Indeed, at the hearing before the
    Application Judge, the Schedule C investors all relied upon the same
    submission, and the same type of relationship on their part. DeJong continues
    to do so in asserting its claim for a constructive trust in the Listed Schedule
    C Properties that were the subject of its cross-motion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judges finding is well-supported on the
    evidence. Ms. Walton owed a fiduciary duty to Dr. Bernstein and the DBDC
    Applicants arising out of their contractual relationship, viewed in the context
    of their overall relationship and the manner in which the co-investments
    strategy was to be carried out.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A contractual relationship does not necessarily give rise to
    fiduciary duties, obviously, but it may, depending on the nature of the
    relationship and the overall relationship between the parties. In <em>Korea
    Data Systems (USA), Inc. v. Aamazing Technologies Inc.,</em> 2015 ONCA 465, 126
    O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 74, this Court reiterated the criteria for a fiduciary
    relationship, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Frame v. Smith</em>,
    [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99, at p. 136, <em>Hodgkinson v. Simms</em>, [1994] 3 S.C.R.
    377, at p. 462, and <em>Galambos v. Perez, </em>2009 SCC 48, [2009] 3 S.C.R.
    247, at para. 66: (i) the fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some
    discretion or power; (ii) the fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power or
    discretion so as to affect the beneficiarys legal or practical interests; (iii)
    the beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at the mercy of the fiduciary
    holding the discretion or power; and (iv) there exists an express or implied
    undertaking by the fiduciary to act in accordance with the duty of loyalty reposed
    in him or her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, the nature of the responsibilities and duties (and
    opportunities) created by the contractual structure, together with the nature
    of the factual relationship as it developed, put Ms. Walton in that category.
    It was the discretion and power left to her under the contracts that created
    the opportunities for her to utilize the various corporations that she <em>de
    facto</em> or otherwise controlled and the vulnerability of the DBDC Applicants
    (and the DeJongs and others) to the very things that happened. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true that Dr. Bernstein, through the DBDC Applicants, made
    his contributions directly to the Schedule B Companies (for the most part)
    rather than handing the money over to Ms. Walton, but given the contractual and
    corporate structuring of the investments program, it was tantamount to doing
    that very thing. As Brown J. found, at para. 161, The [Waltons] had complete
    control over all of the funds.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The liability of the Listed Schedule C Companies  the
    strangers to the fiduciary relationship in this scenario  therefore turns on
    a determination of the third and fourth requirements for knowing assistance:
    their actual knowledge of the fiduciary relationship and the fraudulent breach,
    and their participation or assistance in the breach itself. The resolution of
    those issues depends primarily on whether Ms. Walton acted as the directing and
    controlling mind of the Schedule C Companies in question, such that her actions
    may appropriately be attributed to them for these purposes.</p>
  <h5>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Application Judges Decision</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judge dismissed the DBDC Applicants claim on the
    basis that Ms. Walton was not the directing and controlling mind of the Listed
    Schedule C Companies, and accordingly that her knowledge and conduct could not
    be taken to be their knowledge and conduct for the purpose of the knowing
    assistance claim. He did not focus, therefore, on the participation element. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judge arrived at this decision because of the
    provisions in the Schedule C shareholder/investment agreements entered into
    between the Waltons and the Schedule C investors. Under those agreements:</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> the Waltons and the investors
    were each to be 50% owners of the shares and each held 50% of the positions on the
    board of directors;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> the company into which the
    investments were to be made was to be used solely for the property to be
    purchased;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> the Waltons were to be
    responsible for the management, supervision and renovation of the property, as
    well as finance, bookkeeping, and all active roles required to complete the
    Project;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> any significant decisions that

  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> if the parties disagreed on how
    to manage, supervise and complete construction of the project, there was to be
    mandatory mediation and arbitration.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judge went on to conclude, at paras. 51-53:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Thus, in so far as the Schedule C Companies are concerned and
    their investors, <span class=Underline>Ms. Walton may have acted as if she was
    the sole decision maker in the Schedule C Companies, but she was not</span>.
    She and her husband were 50% owners with the right to exercise 50% of the
    significant decisions. There is no evidence that the other investors were aware
    of the fraudulent conduct of Ms. Walton. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline>It would be contrary to the Schedule C
    investor agreements to hold that Ms. Walton could cause the Schedule C
    investors to be a party to her fraudulent dealings with Dr. Bernstein.</span> Thus
    I cannot find that the Schedule C Companies are liable to the [DBDC Applicants]
    for knowing assistance. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully, I do not think this conclusion is sustainable either
    in law or in fact on this record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The error of law arises in two respects. First, the Application
    Judge failed to recognize that, for purposes of attribution and determining
    whether a person is the controlling mind and will of a corporation with respect
    to a particular transaction or series of transactions, the formal governing
    structure established by the contractual and corporate documentation is not
    dispositive. What matters is the factual reality of the situation and whether Norma
    Walton was acting within the field of operation assigned to [her] and carrying
    out [her] assigned function[s] with respect to the corporations at the time
    she used them as vehicles to perpetrate her fraud: see <em>Canadian Dredge and
    Dock Company Limited v. R.</em>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 662, at pp. 685, 714. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly, the Application Judge mistakenly focused on whether it
    was appropriate to hold that Ms. Walton could cause the Schedule C investors
    to be a party to her fraudulent dealings with Dr. Bernstein. Respectfully,
    that was not the right question. The pertinent question was whether Ms. Walton
    had caused the Schedule C Companies <span class=Underline>to participate in her
    fraudulent dealings</span>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The errors of fact, or of mixed fact and law, consist of the
    Application Judges failure to find, on this record: (i) that Ms. Waltons
    position as the sole active director, officer and manager of the Listed Schedule
    C Companies, for all practical purposes, and her conduct and knowledge with
    respect to them, met the legal test for the directing and controlling mind of
    those companies; and (ii) that the Listed Schedule C Companies participated in
    the fiduciary breach. I turn to these issues now.</p>
  <h5 style='line-height:normal'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Norma Walton Was the Directing and Controlling Mind Of the Listed Schedule
    C Companies For These Purposes</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A corporation is an abstract legal entity and has no mind or will
    of its own. Consequently, for civil and criminal purposes, its mind or will is found
    in the natural person or persons acting as the directing mind or will of the
    corporation: the ego or alter ego of the corporation; the centre of the
    corporate personality. This theory of corporate identification or
    attribution was first developed by Viscount Haldane L.C. in <em>Lennards
    Carrying Co. Ltd. v. Asiatic Petroleum Co. Ltd</em>., [1915] A.C. 705, at pp. 713-714,
    a case involving civil fault and negligence. It was explored at length in the
    criminal context by Estey J. in <em>Canadian Dredge</em>, at pp. 677-685, and
    has been found to be equally applicable in a civil action in Canada: <em>Standard
    Investments Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce </em>(1985), 52 O.R.
    (2d) 473 (C.A.), at para. 55, leave to appeal refused, [1986] S.C.C.A. No. 29. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The corporate identification doctrine was aptly summarized  in
    the civil context, but with the acknowledgement that the alter ego doctrine
    applies with no divergence of approach in civil and criminal matters  by
    Nourse L.J. in <em>El Ajou</em>, at pp. 695-696:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This doctrine, sometimes known as the alter ego doctrine, has
    been developed, with no divergence of approach, in both criminal and civil
    jurisdictions, the authorities in each being cited indifferently in the other. A
    company having no mind or will of its own, the need for it arises because the
    criminal law often requires mens rea as a constituent of the crime, and the
    civil law intention or knowledge as an ingredient of the cause of action or
    defence. In the oft-quoted words of Viscount Haldane LC in <em>Lennards
    Carrying Co. Ltd v. Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd</em>:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>My Lords, a corporation is an abstraction. It has no mind
    of its own any more than it has a body of its own; its active and directing
    will must consequently be sought in the person of somebody who for some
    purposes may be called an agent, but <span class=Underline>who is really the
    directing mind and will of the corporation, the very ego and centre of the
    personality of the corporation</span>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The doctrine attributes to the company the mind and will of the
    natural person or persons who manage and control its actions. At that point, in
    the words of Millett J:<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[9]</span></span></span></a> <span class=Underline>Their minds are its mind; their intention its intention;
    their knowledge its knowledge</span>. It is important to emphasize that <span
class=Underline>management and control is not something to be considered
    generally or in the round. It is necessary to identify the natural person or
    persons having management and control in relation to the act or omission in
    point</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Decided cases show that, in regard to the requisite status and
    authority, <span class=Underline>the formal position, as regulated by the
    companys articles of association, service contracts and so forth, though
    highly relevant, may not be decisive</span>. Here Millett J adopted a pragmatic
    approach. In my view he was right to do so. [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judge quoted from the foregoing passage in <em>El
    Ajou</em>. However, he stopped at the words Their minds are its mind; their
    intention its intention; their knowledge its knowledge. Significantly, he
    appears to have overlooked the emphasis placed by the court on the importance
    of identifying the natural person or persons having <span class=Underline>management
    and control in relation to the act or omission in point</span> (emphasis
    added), and the recognition that the formal position, as established in the
    corporate and other related documentation, though highly relevant, <span
class=Underline>may not be decisive</span> (emphasis added). As Iacobucci J.
    put it in <em>Rhône v. Peter A.B. Widener</em>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 497, at p. 521,
    [t]he courts must consider who has been left with the decision-making power in
    a relevant sphere of corporate activity. See also <em>Meridian Global Fund
    Management Asia Ltd. v. Securities Commission</em>, [1995] 2 A.C. 500, at p. 507.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This omission appears to have led the Application Judge to accept
    the formal position set out in the terms of the Schedule C Company
    shareholder agreements as dispositive of whether Ms. Walton was the controlling
    and directing mind of those corporations. The passage from his reasons, cited
    in para. 54 above, confirms that to be the case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In reality, however, no one other than Ms. Walton did anything or
    made any decisions respecting the flow of funds that were utilized for the
    acquisition, management, construction and financing of the Schedule C
    Properties. That under the formal corporate documentation and
    shareholder/investor agreements the investors were 50% shareholders and, with
    the Waltons, directors of the Listed Schedule C Companies, and were
    contractually entitled to be consulted on significant decisions that differed
    from the project plan, is of little import when in the here and now the
    Waltons were fraudulently ignoring their obligations to the investors and were
    keeping them in the dark, and when the investors  based on their trust of the
    Waltons and the terms of their agreements  were leaving all management matters
    to the Waltons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Had the Application Judge not adopted the approach that he did,
    he would have appreciated that, on any view of the evidence in these
    proceedings  including, it seems, even her own  Ms. Walton was the directing
    and controlling mind of the Listed Schedule C Companies for purposes of the
    acquisition, construction, renovation, financing and management of the Schedule
    C Properties held by the Schedule C Companies and, more particularly, with
    respect to the transfer of source funds from the investors and, in some cases,
    the re-casting of corporate shareholding structuring necessary to effect those
    purposes. Respectfully  adopt[ing] a pragmatic approach, to borrow the expression
    employed in <em>El Ajou</em>  it is not open on this record to hold that Ms. Walton
    was not the alter ego and directing and controlling mind of the Listed Schedule
    C Companies, acting within the field of operations delegated to her and as
    the primary representative  through whom [the corporation] act[ed], sp[oke]
    and [thought] for these purposes: <em>Canadian Dredge</em>, at p. 682; <em>R.

    acknowledgement that, as a factual matter, Ms. Walton was acting as the sole
    decision-maker for the corporations. He found, at para. 51, that Ms. Walton
    may have acted as if she was the sole decision maker in the Schedule C
    Companies, but she was not. Further, he noted, at para. 71, that Ms. Walton
    managed the day to day affairs of the business and that the investment of
    DeJong was under the complete control of the Waltons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the same proceedings made by Brown J. and by the Application Judge himself:</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:115%'>(a) Ms. Walton was a director of
    each of the Schedule C Companies and, from all accounts, the only active
    director and officer.</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:115%'> (b) As found by Brown J. in the
    earlier portion of these same proceedings:</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:115%'>(i) The Schedule C
    Companies were owned and controlled by the Waltons;</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:115%'>(ii) <span

    affidavits and through her submissions, <span class=Underline>as the person who
    was in charge of the entire enterprise</span>, whether it be the operation of
    the Schedule B companies, Rose &amp; Thistle or <span class=Underline>the
    Schedule C Companies</span> [emphasis added];</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:115%'>(iii) Neither
    Ronauld Walton nor the Chief Financial Officer of Rose &amp; Thistle had come
    forward to say that the improper transfers of monies out of the Schedule B
    Companies were the result of directions or orders given by someone other than
    Norma Walton (from which he inferred that they were not); and</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='line-height:115%'>(iv) Ms. Walton
    simply did as she saw fit irrespective of her legal obligations and ignored
    the contractual language that bound her.</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='
line-height:115%'>(c) The shareholder agreements respecting
    the Schedule B Companies (in which the DBDC Applicants were involved) and the
    Schedule C Companies (in which the Respondents were involved) all provided that
    the Waltons were to be responsible for the management, supervision and
    renovation of the projects.</p>
  <p class=CQuote style='
line-height:115%'>(d) Ms. Walton deposed before Brown J. that <span class=Underline>she</span> was managing the jointly-owned portfolio of the
    companies, and that she used Rose &amp; Thistle as a clearing house account to
    smooth cash flow across the portfolio. </p>
  <p class=CQuote style='
line-height:115%'>While the specific reference to the
    jointly-owned portfolio of companies was to the Schedule B Companies in which
    the Waltons and Dr. Bernstein each held a 50% interest, Ms. Walton also acknowledged
    that the funds Dr. Bernstein was advancing to the Schedule B Companies were
    being pooled amongst those companies, then transferred to Rose &amp; Thistle
    and also to the Schedule C Companies. </p>
  <p class=CQuote style='

    the findings of Brown J., including the finding that in many cases the funds

    Companies and that the Schedule C Companies were controlled by the Waltons. </p>
  <p class=CQuote style='

    error on the part of the Application Judge, respectfully, to find that Ms.
    Walton was not in fact and reality the directing and controlling mind of the
    Schedule C Companies. The corporate documentation and contractual framework had
    little, if any, bearing on how the Schedule C Companies, and the Listed
    Schedule C Companies in particular, operated, except to provide Ms. Walton with
    her entrée to the corporate levers necessary to work the Waltons scheme.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In those circumstances, her knowledge and conduct can be attributed
    to the corporations. Ms. Walton exercised complete management and control over
    all relevant actions executed by the Schedule C Companies. To paraphrase from <em>El
    Ajou</em>,<em> </em>for these purposes her mind was their mind; her intention,
    their intention; her knowledge, their knowledge. She was the person through
    whom the corporations <span class=Underline>acted</span>, spoke and thought for
    these purposes:<em> Canadian Dredge, </em>at p. 682. In short, her perpetration
    of the scheme was their participation in the scheme.</p>

style='line-height:200%'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Respondents argue that, even so, this is insufficient to fix
    the Listed Schedule C Companies with Ms. Waltons knowledge and fraudulent
    conduct for purposes of establishing civil responsibility, because the criteria
    set out in <em>Canadian Dredge </em> albeit in the context of criminal
    responsibility  have not been met. At pp. 713-714 of that decision, Estey J.
    said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]n my view the identification doctrine only operates where
    the Crown demonstrates that the action taken by the directing mind (a) was
    within the field of operation assigned to him; (b) was not totally in fraud of
    the corporation; and (c) was by design or result partly for the benefit of the
    company.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before turning to these criteria, I think it is useful to
    recognize the setting in which they are being considered. The case law has
    applied <em>Canadian Dredge</em> in the criminal and civil contexts without
    discrimination. In my view, it does not follow, however, that the criteria need
    be applied in a rigid, identical, fashion in all circumstances. The burden of
    proof is less onerous in civil cases. This particular civil case involves a
    complex multi-real estate transaction investment fraud, perpetrated over an extended
    period of time, and implicating numerous corporate actors (operating at the
    instance of the fraudster) and numerous victims. In these circumstances, it
    makes sense that, of the <em>Canadian Dredge</em> criteria, (b) and (c) at
    least may be approached in a less demanding fashion than would be the case were <em>mens rea</em> for purposes of establishing criminal responsibility in play.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary to the view expressed by my colleague, I do not think it
    is the case in such circumstances that the claimant must necessarily show
    evidence of each companys individual benefit from the scheme (at para. 234).
    As noted earlier, and as I shall explain more fully below, liability for
    knowing assistance is fault-based rather than receipt-based and does not
    require the defendant to have obtained a benefit from the defaulting
    fiduciarys breach. To apply criterion (c) of <em>Canadian Dredge</em>  by
    design or result partly for the benefit of the company  too strictly therefore
    makes little sense, as it would risk muddying the distinction between the two
    categories of claim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition, as I develop below, there are sound policy reasons
    for not adopting the narrower view favoured by my colleague. This is consistent
    with the approach recently taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Livent</em>.
    The Court declined to adopt a rigid application of the <em>Canadian Dredge</em> criteria in the context of a civil case, emphasizing that the corporate
    identification doctrine is one having its roots in policy considerations: see <em>Livent</em>,
    at paras. 100-104. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, policy considerations support a more flexible
    approach in complex and large, multi-corporation, multi-party fraud cases such
    as the present one, for the reasons I set out below. I do not think, in these
    circumstances, that it matters whether the flexibility is applied at the
    criteria-application phase or the overall-equitable consideration stage of the
    analysis.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting Within the Assigned Field of Operation</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <em>Canadian Dredge</em> confirms that the attribution of an
    employee/managers conduct or knowledge to a corporation does not turn on
    whether the individual was acting within the scope of his or her employment
    or was off on a frolic of their own in the tortious sense of vicarious liability.
    The test is whether the directing mind is acting within the scope of his [or
    her] <span class=Underline>authority</span><em>in the sense of acting in the
    course of the corporations business</em>,<em> </em>or<em> </em>with <em>reference
    to the field of operations delegated to the directing mind</em>,<em> </em>or<em> </em><em>within the scope of the area of the work assigned to him [or her]</em>
    (underlining in original; italics added): at pp. 684-685.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, for all the reasons articulated earlier in this decision
    leading to the conclusion that Ms. Walton was the directing and controlling
    mind of the Listed Schedule C Companies, she falls squarely within that
    category of individual.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In her capacity as the person in charge of the entire
    enterprise, Ms. Walton was acting well within the field of operations
    delegated to her by the shareholder agreements of the Schedule B and C Companies,
    their corporate structures (she was a director and officer), and the conduct of
    the parties. It was her responsibility to complete the transactions by which
    the Schedule C Properties were acquired by the Schedule C Companies, to manage
    the projects, and to arrange for the necessary financings and re-financings.
    That she breached the shareholder agreements by not obtaining the necessary
    consents from the investors and by not providing accurate and timely
    information, that she breached her fiduciary obligations to the DBDC Applicants
    and Dr. Bernstein by misusing and misappropriating the funds they invested in
    the Schedule B Companies, that she breached her obligations to the Respondents
    as well in relation to their investments in the Schedule C Companies, and that
    she perpetrated her fraud on both the Applicants and the Respondents by
    betraying their trust and exercising the corporate powers left to her  none of
    these considerations detracts from the reality that in fact and in law she was
    acting within the field of operations and the area of corporate management
    delegated and assigned to her. Her fraudulent actions in directing the flow of
    monies in and out of the various corporations were carried out within the
    framework of her delegated responsibilities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='line-height:200%;font-style:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The first <em>Canadian Dredge</em> criterion is met.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fraud/Benefit of the Corporation</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second and third <em>Canadian Dredge </em>criteria may be
    considered together. They require that the action taken by the directing mind
    not be totally in fraud of the corporation and that, by design or result, it be
    partly for the benefit of the corporation. In my view, as noted earlier, their
    application may be approached in a broader fashion in circumstances such as these,
    than would be the case in a criminal law context.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That said, I am satisfied the actions of Ms. Walton do meet those
    requirements, nonetheless. The Listed Schedule C Companies were not totally
    defrauded and, indeed, benefitted at least partly from Ms. Waltons actions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although some of their investors monies were misapplied and
    misused in breach of Ms. Waltons fiduciary duties  as were the investments of
    the DBDC Applicants  the Listed Schedule C Companies nevertheless acquired
    properties, as they were intended to do and as part of the investment
    arrangements. As a result of Ms. Waltons net transfer of at least $23.6
    million from the Schedule B Companies to Rose &amp; Thistle and the net
    transfer of $25.4 million from Rose &amp; Thistle to the Schedule C Companies,
    the latter acquired funding necessary for their ongoing operations; Brown J.
    accepted the Inspectors conclusion that the DBDC Applicants investments in
    the Schedule B Companies [were] a major source of funds for the [Schedule C]
    Companies. The record shows that each of the Listed Schedule C Companies
    either received from or transferred to Rose &amp; Thistle monies or
    monies-worth, during the relevant period. Given the co-mingling of funds, it is
    not possible to trace the complete path of all these transactions; however, Ms.
    Walton herself acknowledged that Rose &amp; Thistle was the clearing house
    for the movement of funds as between the Schedule B Companies, Rose &amp;
    Thistle, and the Schedule C Companies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague suggests that a <em>specific</em> benefit flowing to
    each Listed Schedule C Company must be identified in order to affix the
    companies with Ms. Waltons knowledge for purposes of knowing assistance. As I
    mentioned briefly earlier in these reasons, there are sound policy reasons, in
    my view, for not adopting a narrow approach on this, and other, issues relevant
    to this appeal. My colleagues approach, in effect, incorporates a tracing
    requirement into the knowing assistance claim, collapsing the distinction
    between knowing assistance and knowing receipt where corporate actors are used
    to assist in breach of fiduciary duty. To do so would mean that justice could
    not properly be done in many cases of massive, multi-corporation, multi-party
    fraud because  as this case demonstrates  the fraudulent co-mingling of funds
    renders it impossible to accomplish that task with the degree of precision
    required for knowing receipt, unjust enrichment or constructive trust.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleagues approach is also influenced <span
style='line-height:200%'>by her view that the</span><em> </em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Listed</span> Schedule C Companies are, themselves,
    victims of the fraud. If that were the case, it may be a consideration in
    determining whether liability may be avoided on overall equity grounds,
    discussed further below. However, I do not think it has much bearing on the
    directing and controlling mind analysis or on the analysis of whether the
    Listed Schedule C Companies in fact assisted and participated in the fraudulent
    breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, as I shall explain later, I do not view
    the Listed Schedule C Companies as being victims of the fraud; rather, their
    investors are the victims of the fraud. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=Underline><span style='line-height:200%;text-decoration:none'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In
    my view, the foregoing factors are sufficient to meet the second and third <em>Canadian
    Dredge</em> criteria, for purposes of establishing that Ms. Walton was the
    directing and controlling mind of the Listed Schedule C Companies, in the
    circumstances of this civil fraud case.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='line-height:normal'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Listed Schedule C Companies Participated in or Assisted Ms. Waltons Fraudulent
    Conduct</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It flows from the foregoing that the participation/assistance
    requirement for the claim of knowing assistance has been met as well.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Walton crafted and choreographed a scheme to enable her and
    her husband to stay ahead of their obligations to provide 50% of the funding
    for the acquisition of the properties and to otherwise enrich themselves
    personally at the expense of their investors. Focusing on Dr. Bernsteins
    circumstances, Brown J. described the fraud, at para. 278, as the system
    created by the Waltons to circulate and mis-use the [DBDC] Applicants funds. Unbeknownst
    to DeJong, the Condos and the Levytams, it was created to circulate and misuse
    their funds as well. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Ms. Walton utilized the Schedule C Companies as actors in the
    process of orchestrating her shell game through the Rose &amp; Thistle
    clearing house account. Funds were co-mingled, when they were supposed to be
    kept project-specific. Investors funds (of both the DBDC Applicants and the Respondents)
    were diverted from their intended project or projects to finance the
    acquisition or operations of other projects, or to benefit the Waltons
    personally. Sometimes this was done on the pretext that the Waltons had made
    their contributions through a phantom equity increase in the value of the
    property previously acquired by them. Sometimes it was done on the pretext that
    their contributions had been made in the form of assignment or purchaser agency
    fees, or management fees, or construction and maintenance costs.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[10]</span></span></span></a> On other occasions, Ms. Walton arranged for the investors to receive preferred
    shareholding positions in different corporations, purportedly in exchange for
    investments made in other investment projects (without revealing that those
    earlier investments had already been lost).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With two possible exceptions, the record shows that each of the
    Listed Schedule C Companies either received monies directly from or transferred
    monies directly to Rose &amp; Thistle during the relevant period, and were
    therefore engaged as corporate actors in an arrangement that, at the end of the
    day, resulted in a net transfer of over $23 million <em>from</em> the DBDC
    Applicants and a net transfer of over $25 million <em>to</em> the Schedule C
    Companies.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The two possible exceptions are St. Clarens Holdings Ltd. and
    Emerson Developments Ltd., the owners of adjoining properties at 777 St.
    Clarens Ave. and 260 Emerson Ave. in Toronto. Nonetheless, the record
    demonstrates that these two corporations were also engaged as actors in the
    overall fraudulent scheme. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em>Participation by St.
    Clarens/Emerson </em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although title to the two properties was taken in the names of
    the two corporations, respectively, the purchase involved a single transaction.
    In July, 2013, a Walton numbered company entered into an agreement of purchase
    and sale with the owners of the two properties. It is said that an $80,000
    deposit was paid at the time, although the source of those funds is not clear
    from the record. In October, 2013, the Walton numbered company assigned the
    agreement of purchase and sale to Rose &amp; Thistle. Rose &amp; Thistle agreed
    to pay an assignment fee of $225,000 and to reimburse the Walton company for
    the $80,000 deposit.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 18, 2013, the Waltons and DeJong entered into the
    standard type of 50/50 shareholder/management agreement described earlier in
    these reasons with respect to the St. Clarens/Emerson properties. That
    agreement stated that the Waltons had previously entered into an agreement of
    purchase and sale regarding the properties, and had previously provided an
    $80,000 deposit along with due diligence fees of approximately $50,000 related
    to the purchase. A Capital Required document associated with the purchase
    indicated that there was a Purchaser agency fee of $225,000 included as part
    of the purchase costs. Dr. DeJong swore that this fee was never discussed with
    or disclosed to her. The Application Judge accepted this evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The St. Clarens/Emerson transaction closed on November 26, 2013
    with Rose &amp; Thistle apparently assigning the original agreement of purchase
    and sale to the purchasing corporations. Apart from the possible $80,000
    deposit provided initially by the Walton numbered company  whether those funds
    came from the Rose &amp; Thistle clearing house account is not known  the
    Waltons made no further contributions to the $665,000 shareholder loan they
    were required to contribute. DeJong advanced its $665,000 to St. Clarens
    Holdings and those funds were used to pay the balance due on closing for both
    properties of $252,397.91.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>How the remainder of the DeJong advance was used is not known
    either. While it is not completely clear from the record whether Ms. Walton
    caused the $225,000 Purchaser agency fee  or, assignment fee as it was
    initially characterized in the assignment agreement  to be made in cash to
    Rose &amp; Thistle or to the Walton numbered company, at the very least it is
    clear that St. Clarens Holdings assumed an accrued liability for the purchaser
    agency fee and accepted responsibility to reimburse the Waltons for the $80,000
    deposit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judge found that the payment of $225,000 was
    clearly deceitful and in breach of the fiduciary duties owed by them to DeJong.
    This finding was undoubtedly open to him on the record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The point of dwelling on the St. Clarens/Emerson transaction is
    not to analyse whether the corporations benefitted from the fraudulent
    scheme. Indirectly they benefitted because they acquired the properties in the
    course of the scheme. Perhaps they benefitted from the payment of the agency
    fee, which may or may not have represented a justifiable expense; we do not
    know. DeJong suffered a loss because, <em>vis-à-vis</em> DeJong, the
    undisclosed fee constituted a deceitful breach of the Waltons fiduciary duties
    to it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The point of dwelling on the St. Clarens/Emerson transaction is
    to show that, even though the purchasing Listed Schedule C Companies may not
    have either received monies directly from or transferred monies directly to
    Rose &amp; Thistle, the transaction permitted Ms. Walton to skim off the
    $225,000 unbeknownst to DeJong. It illustrates yet another way in which Ms.
    Walton engaged the Listed Schedule C Companies as actors in her overall
    fraudulent undertaking in breach of her fiduciary obligations to both the DBDC
    Applicants and DeJong.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Improper as they were, each of these transactions  together with
    all the other in-and-out transactions  required a corporate act of one form or
    another. As the directing mind of the Listed Schedule C Companies for these
    purposes, Ms. Waltons acts were their acts, and the Companies accordingly
    participated in or assisted Ms. Walton in her breach of fiduciary duties to the
    DBDC Applicants.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em>Additional Arguments Raised
    Against Finding Participation/Knowledge</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For purposes of the participation and knowledge analyses, it
    matters little, in my view, that the DBDC Applicants are unable to demonstrate
    the receipt of any <em>particular</em> Schedule B Company funds by any <em>particular</em> Listed Schedule C Company (other than the funds with respect to which Brown J.
    previously granted constructive trusts). It is therefore of little significance
    that the net transfer analysis was not intended to, and does not, establish
    such a connection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague places considerable emphasis on these points. As she
    puts it, at para. 185 of her analysis, for example, the net transfer analysis
    was never intended to be used for the purpose of establishing a claim by the
    DBDC Applicants against the property of other defrauded investors, and, at
    para. 195, [t]he net transfer analysis does not show where the money went
    after it was transferred into Rose &amp; Thistle, or that any of the net money
    ended up in any particular Walton-controlled account (including any Listed
    Schedule C Company account).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Respectfully, these concerns are misplaced in the context of a
    claim for knowing assistance.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, as I have emphasized, they conflate knowing assistance
    with knowing receipt. If it were necessary to demonstrate the <span
class=Underline>receipt</span> of funds by the defendant in order to establish
    a claim for knowing <span class=Underline>assistance</span>, there would be no
    need for the knowing assistance remedy. The claim of knowing assistance is
    designed to capture circumstances where knowing receipt, unjust enrichment,
    or a constructive trust on some other basis cannot be established, but where a
    fault-based remedy is appropriate to compensate for the defendants knowing
    assistance in the perpetration of a fraudulent and dishonest breach of
    fiduciary duty. This is one of those cases. In addition, as mentioned above,
    there are sound policy reasons for not importing a tracing requirement as a
    necessary component of the knowing assistance claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Secondly, while the net transfer analysis may not have been
    suitable for purposes of tracing Schedule B Company funds into particular
    Listed Schedule C Company accounts, it clearly established a net <span
class=Underline>outflow</span> from the Schedule B Companies accounts of $23.6
    million. Both Brown J. and the Application Judge made that finding. This is
    relevant for all the various reasons recited above, as well as for the measure
    of the DBDC Applicants damages. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor do I share the view that the Listed Schedule C Companies were
    not participants in Ms. Waltons fraudulent breach because they were victims of
    the same fraudulent scheme and were merely used by Ms. Walton as conduits or
    pawns in the perpetration of that scheme, without the demonstration of receiving
    any benefit themselves.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague acknowledges that the Listed Schedule C Companies
    may have participated in Ms. Waltons overall fraudulent scheme, in the sense
    that they were used by her in the shell game to co-mingle investor funds, and
    to avoid making her own contributions (at para. 231). She acknowledges that knowing
    assistance does not require a defendant to have received a benefit for these
    purposes (at para. 234). Yet, she concludes that the net transfer analysis
    does not provide the evidence that they participated in her breach of fiduciary
    duty to the DBDC Applicants so as to attract personal liability for knowing
    assistance (at para. 231), and that the issue of benefit is relevant here
    because Ms. Waltons conduct was in fraud of the very entities sought to be
    made liable for knowing assistance (at para. 234).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This approach conflates the Companies with their investors and
    preferred shareholders, however. It also overlooks the finding that Ms. Walton
    was the controlling and directing mind of the companies and that her intentions
    and conduct were theirs. The <span style='line-height:200%'>Listed Schedule C
    Companies are not defrauded victims of Ms. Waltons fraudulent scheme; their
    investors and preferred shareholders are the defrauded victims. And, as noted
    above, they did benefit generally from the perpetration of the overall fraud.
    T</span>he Companies acquired the properties they were created to acquire. They
    received the funds enabling them to do so. As Brown J. found, the DBDC
    Applicants<span lang=EN-US> investments were used to fund their ongoing
    operations and provided a major source of funds for the Walton Schedule C
    Properties/Companies (at para. 269). It was the way in which the investors
    funds (the DBDC Applicants, as well as those of DeJong and others) were
    fraudulently co-mingled and moved amongst the entire portfolio of properties
    and projects that constituted the fraud. However, it was fraud perpetrated on
    the investors, not on the Listed Schedule C Companies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Waltons breach of fiduciary duty to the DBDC Applicants was
    to cause the funds they invested in the Schedule B Companies to be diverted out
    of those Companies for her own personal use. That the Schedule C investors or
    the Schedule C Companies were also the objects of a similar co-mingling and
    diversion of their funds, is not important for the participation and
    knowledge requirements of the knowing assistance analysis, in my view. For
    the Listed Schedule C Companies to be found liable on that basis, it need not
    be shown that they assisted directly in acts involving the diversion of
    Schedule B Companies funds <span class=Underline>into</span> the Listed
    Schedule C Companies accounts. It need only be shown that they knowingly
    assisted in Ms. Waltons fraudulent and dishonest scheme to divert monies <span
class=Underline>out of</span><span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:
none'> </span></span>the Schedule B Companies accounts. It is the overall
    fraudulent scheme, and the Listed Schedule C Companies knowing assistance in
    the perpetration of that shell game that provides the prism through which
    liability for this claim must be determined. The policy considerations
    respecting cases such as this, referred to above, support this analysis, in my
    view.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is not an answer to say that a similar claim for joint and
    several damages might be asserted against the Schedule B Companies on the same
    basis. No one is asserting such a claim in these proceedings. And, although the
    Schedule C investors were also victimized in the scheme, it must be remembered
     as found by Brown J., and accepted by the Application Judge  that net funds
    of $23.6 million<em> flowed out of the Schedule B Companies</em> into Rose
    &amp; Thistle, and net funds of $25.4 million<em> flowed out of Rose &amp;
    Thistle</em> <em>into the Schedule C Companies</em>. It is the DBDC Applicants,
    not the Schedule C Companies, that suffered the net losses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>DeJong and the other Respondents raise an additional argument.
    They submit that the fact they had no knowledge of the scheme or breaches
    personally, or in their capacities as lenders to or shareholders of the
    Schedule C Companies, shields the Listed Schedule C Companies from liability
    for knowing assistance. However, it is the knowledge of the <em>corporation</em> that is relevant to the establishment of liability, not the knowledge of the
    corporations creditors, shareholders, or its directors or officers other than
    the directing mind. As noted above, the issue is not whether the co-investors
    were co-opted into participating in the scheme; the issue is whether the
    Schedule C Companies knowingly assisted Ms. Walton in carrying out the scheme.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This principle is illustrated by both <em>Canadian Dredge</em> and <em>El Ajou</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Canadian Dredge</em>, the corporation was found to be
    criminally liable on the basis that the knowledge and conduct of its directing
    minds were attributed to it for that purpose, notwithstanding that innocent
    investors might be penalized: see p. 694. At p. 685, Estey J. noted that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Acts of the ego of a corporation taken within the assigned
    managerial area may give rise to corporate criminal responsibility, whether or
    not there be formal delegation; <span class=Underline>whether or not there be
    awareness of the activity in the board of directors or the officers of the
    company</span>; and, as discussed below, <span class=Underline>whether or not
    there be express prohibition</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the existence of an express prohibition forbidding a directing
    mind to do an act is not sufficient, by itself, to avoid corporate criminal
    responsibility, the breach of a shareholder agreement on the part of the
    directing mind cannot be sufficient to avoid corporate civil responsibility. The
    fact that Ms. Walton was carrying out the transactions for a corrupt purpose,
    and not advising her co-investors of the details, does not, in my view, affect
    the attribution of her intentions and actions to the Listed Schedule C
    Companies: see <em>Meridian Global</em>, at p. 511.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>El Ajou</em>, a civil case involving corporate liability
    for knowing receipt, the owners of the corporation were completely unaware of
    the fraud perpetrated by the director, who had <em>de facto</em> management and
    control in respect of the fraudulent transaction. Nonetheless, the corporation
    was found to be liable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Respondents seek to distinguish <em>El Ajou</em> on the basis
    that it applied knowing receipt as opposed to knowing assistance, and that
    constructive knowledge is sufficient to ground liability for the former while
    actual knowledge is required for the latter. In my view, <em>El Ajou</em> is
    not distinguishable on that basis. There is nothing to suggest that the
    knowledge the court was attributing to the corporation in that case was
    constructive knowledge. Rather, what was imputed to the corporation was the <em>actual</em> knowledge of the directing mind. As Nourse L.J. noted, at p. 695, the person
    found to be the directing mind of the corporation (a Mr. Ferdman) freely
    admitted <span class=Underline>that he knew</span> [of the fraudulent
    transactions in question] (emphasis added). This is the language of actual
    knowledge, not that of constructive knowledge. Constructive knowledge arises
    when a person has knowledge of circumstances that would indicate certain facts
    to a reasonable person, or knowledge of circumstances that would put an honest
    and reasonable person on inquiry: see <em>Air Canada, </em>at p. 812<em>;
    Citadel General</em>, at para. 22. It was the actual knowledge of Mr. Ferdman
    that was attributed to the corporation as its knowledge.</p>
  <h5>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Requirements for Knowing Assistance are Met Here</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For all these reasons, I am satisfied that the DBDC Applicants
    have established the necessary components for a claim of knowing assistance in
    a breach of fiduciary duty: (i) Ms. Walton owed a fiduciary duty to the DBDC
    Applicants; (ii) she breached that duty; (iii) the Listed Schedule C Companies,
    as strangers to the fiduciary relationship, had actual knowledge of both the
    fiduciary relationship and the fraudulent and dishonest conduct of the fiduciary,
    because in the circumstances Ms. Waltons mind was their mind, her intent their
    intent, and her knowledge their knowledge; and (iv) for similar reasons, the Listed
    Schedule C Companies participated in or assisted Ms. Waltons fraudulent and
    dishonest conduct.</p>
  <h2>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Respondents make an additional argument, based on equitable
    grounds. They submit that to give effect to the claim for damages based on knowing
    assistance in the circumstances of this case would be to: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Stretch] the bounds of equity in ways not contemplated by the
    goals of restitutionary proprietary remedies. That is particularly so in the
    face of investors that actually put funds into these particular Schedule C
    Companies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The argument is misconceived in this context, however. It
    conflates a claim for damages with a claim for a proprietary remedy and, in
    particular, the claim for knowing assistance with the claim for knowing receipt.
    As I shall explain more fully, knowing assistance is not a remedy grounded in
    the principles of restitution or proprietary remedies. The DBDC Applicants are
    not seeking, at this stage, a restitutionary or proprietary-based remedy in
    respect of any of the Schedule C Properties (over and above the constructive
    trusts earlier granted by Brown J. with respect to certain of those Companies).
    They seek only a remedy in damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Brown J. granted the DBDC Applicants a tracing order against the
    Listed Schedule C Companies to further the evidence available to support their
    claim for unjust enrichment. By the time the issue came before the Application
    Judge, however, the DBDC Applicants had decided to forego the tracing exercise
    and any claim to a proprietary interest in the Schedule C Properties held by those
    companies. Instead, they asserted only their claim for damages on a joint and
    several basis for knowing assistance and/or receipt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As noted earlier in these reasons, liability for knowing
    assistance  unlike knowing receipt  does not depend upon the receipt of
    property, and the measure of recovery does not depend upon the value of any
    property obtained by the stranger as a result of the breach of the fiduciarys
    obligations. Whereas the essence of liability for knowing receipt is unjust
    enrichment, the gravamen of liability for knowing assistance is simply knowing participation
    or assistance in the breach in furtherance of the defaulting trustee or
    fiduciarys fraudulent and dishonest conduct: <em>Gold v. Rosenberg</em>, at
    para. 41; <em>Citadel General</em>, at paras. 46-47. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>La Forest J. addressed this dichotomy in <em>Citadel General</em>,
    underscoring the importance of distinguishing between the knowing assistance
    and knowing receipt claims, and their underpinnings. After referring to a
    passage from the judgment of Millett J., the judge of first instance in the <em>Agip
    (Africa) Ltd.</em> case, La Forest J. said, at paras. 46-47:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In other words, the distinction between the two categories of
    liability is fundamental: whereas the accessorys liability is fault-based,
    the recipients liability is receipt-based. In an extrajudicial opinion,
    Millett J. described the distinction as follows:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote> the liability of the accessory is limited to the case
    where the breach of trust in question was fraudulent and dishonest; the liability
    of the recipient is not so limited. In truth, however, the distinction is
    fundamental; there is no similarity between the two categories. <span
class=Underline>The accessory</span> is a person who either never received the
    property at all, or who received it in circumstances where his receipt was
    irrelevant. His <span class=Underline>liability cannot be receipt-based. It is
    necessarily fault-based, and is imposed on him not in the context of the law of
    competing priorities to property, but in the application of the law which is
    concerned with the furtherance of fraud</span>. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>Tracing the Proceeds of Fraud [(1991), 107 L.Q.R. 71], <em>supra</em>,
    at p. 83.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The same view was expressed by the Privy Council in <em>Royal
    Brunei Airlines Sdn. Bhd. v. Tan</em>, [1995] 3 W.L.R. 64, at p. 70: <span
class=Underline>Different considerations apply to the two heads of liability. Recipient
    liability is restitution-based; accessory liability is not</span>. These
    comments are also cited with approval by Iacobucci J. in <em>Gold</em>, <em>supra</em>,
    at para. 41. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In a scholarly article written prior to his appointment to the
    bench, Intermeddlers or Strangers to the Breach of Trust or Fiduciary Duty
    (1998) 21 Advocates Q 94, at p. 107, Paul M. Perell put it this way:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To be liable for knowing assistance, the stranger <span
class=Underline>must have actual knowledge</span> of the trustees or
    fiduciarys dishonest or fraudulent act <span class=Underline>but, beyond being
    shown to have participated in that design</span>, the third party  need not
    necessarily be shown to have acted in a fraudulent or dishonest fashion. And <span
class=Underline>the stranger need not have taken or held any property</span>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Respondents argue that they were innocent investors who had
    no knowledge of Ms. Waltons fraudulent and dishonest ways, and that in the
    contest between two sets of equally innocent victims of the Waltons fraud it
    would not be equitable to grant an award of damages in favour of the DBDC
    Applicants, thereby placing Dr. Bernstein and his companies, as judgment
    creditors, in a more advantageous position over them as shareholders of the Listed
    Schedule C Companies or as creditors. The Application Judge appears to have
    accepted this contention, noting at para. 51 of his reasons that [t]here is no
    evidence that the other investors were aware of the fraudulent conduct of Ms.
    Walton, and stating, at para. 52 that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The issue raised by the [DBDC Applicants] is not a contest
    between Dr. Bernstein and the Waltons. It is a contest between Dr. Bernstein
    and the investors in the Schedule C Companies who suffered from the same
    misconduct as did Dr. Bernstein. Ms. Walton knowingly breached her fiduciary
    obligations to the Schedule C Companies and the Schedule C investors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That is not the point, however. As noted earlier, it is the knowledge
    of the Listed Schedule C Companies  the strangers to the fiduciary
    relationship in this case  rather than the knowledge of their investors or
    shareholders that is relevant in assessing the claim for knowing assistance. And,
    to repeat the words of Millett J., cited with approval in <em>Citadel General</em>,
    at para. 46, liability for knowing assistance is necessarily fault-based, and <span
class=Underline>is imposed on [the knowing accessory] not in the context of the
    law of competing priorities to property, but in the application of the law
    which is concerned with the furtherance of fraud</span> (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is because of the distinction between the underpinnings of the
    knowing assistance and knowing receipt claims that the knowledge requirement is
    different  actual knowledge, for knowing assistance; constructive knowledge,
    for knowing receipt. But it is also for this reason, in my opinion, that
    discretionary considerations pertaining to the application of a trust-imposed
    proprietary remedy are of considerably less significance when the claim of the
    knowing assistance plaintiff arises, as it does here, in damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While I need not go so far as to say that a court may never
    exercise a discretion to decline a remedy where the four criteria for
    establishing liability for knowing assistance have been met, I find it hard to
    conceive of a case where  in the face of a defendants participation or assistance
    in a fraudulent and dishonest scheme perpetrated by a fiduciary and with actual
    knowledge of both the fiduciary relationship and the fraudulent and dishonest
    scheme  a court would do so. It is the role of equity and the courts to guard
    against such an outcome and not to sanction such conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true here that the Schedule B Companies money cannot be
    directly traced into the Listed Schedule C Companies (with the exception of
    those against which Brown J. awarded a constructive trust). However, these
    Listed Schedule C Companies transferred money to and from Rose &amp; Thistle as
    a part of the scheme orchestrated by the Waltons or assumed liability in favour
    of Rose &amp; Thistle as part of the scheme. As well, it is worth repeating
    that the Schedule C Companies were significant net beneficiaries in the flow of
    funds emanating from the pooling and co-mingling of the various investors
    monies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because I do not view the Listed Schedule C Companies as
    themselves victims of the fraud, I see no basis for excusing them from fault
    on the ground that they were simply caught up in, and used, as part of the
    wrongdoers wrongful scheme. They remained, nonetheless, participants and
    actors in the perpetration of that scheme. Nor do I think it significant, as my
    colleague notes, that the DBDC Applicants have adopted the practical choice of
    pursuing only those Schedule C Companies that may have assets against which to
    recover. While reasons relating to the likelihood of recovery under a judgment
    or order may explain why proceedings are taken against certain parties, those
    reasons should not be confused with reasons underlying liability giving rise to
    the judgment. In the result, I do not see any overriding equitable
    considerations that militate against application of the knowing assistance
    remedy in the circumstances of this case.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I am satisfied that, once it is determined
    that the Listed Schedule C Companies knowingly participated in the fraudulent
    and dishonest breach of fiduciary duty by the Waltons, the DBDC Applicants are
    entitled to an award of damages against them as knowing accessories to the
    breach. As I have explained above, the Listed Schedule C Companies did so
    because Ms. Waltons knowledge and actions are to be attributed to them as their
    own. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appropriate measure of damages in the circumstances is the
    loss caused to the DBDC Applicants by the dishonest fiduciarys fraudulent
    scheme arising from the participation and assistance of the Listed Schedule C
    Companies in that scheme. That is because liability for knowing assistance is
    fault based and is measured by the loss flowing from the fault. As Perell
    summarized it in the article cited earlier in these reasons, at p. 113:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>One very significant difference arising from the different
    rationales is that the beneficiarys recovery from knowing receipt may be less
    than the recovery from knowing assistance. This follows because, under the
    doctrine of knowing receipt, the defendants liability is measured by his
    unjust enrichment while, <span class=Underline>under the doctrine of knowing
    assistance, the defendants liability is measured by the plaintiffs injury
    consequent to the trustees misconduct.</span> The plaintiffs injury may
    exceed the defendants benefit. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the loss is measured by the net transfer to the
    Schedule C Companies, globally, of $22.6 million.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once it is established that the Listed Schedule C Companies are
    each liable for knowingly assisting Ms. Walton in the global scheme in breach
    of her fiduciary obligations to the DBDC Applicants, it follows in the
    circumstances that the Listed Schedule C Companies are jointly and severally
    liable for the losses sustained: see <em>Enbridge Gas</em>, at para. 31. In
    that case, this Court upheld the trial judges finding that the defendants were
    jointly and severally liable for the full extent of the losses sustained by
    Enbridge even though the defendants played different roles in assisting in the
    fraud and received unequal portions of the misappropriated funds. I see no
    basis for departing from that same line of reasoning.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the DBDC Applicants are entitled to an award of damages in
    the amount of $22.6 million against the Listed Schedule C Companies, they are
    not entitled to make a double recovery. The net transfer analysis was prepared
    in relation to the Schedule B and Schedule C Companies. Brown J. awarded
    constructive trusts in favour of the DBDC Applicants against eight Schedule C
    Properties, for a total of $8,128,325 (of which, we are advised, the amount of
    $1,192,150 has been recovered). The constructive trusts were awarded in cases where
    the Inspector was able to trace funds from a Schedule B Company, through Rose
    &amp; Thistle, and into a Schedule C Company, and the Schedule C Company used those
    funds in respect of a Schedule C Property. Those funds were necessarily part of
    the larger $23.6 million (less a $1 million reduction for management fees) that
    was transferred out of the Schedule B Companies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It follows, therefore, that any amounts actually recovered by the
    DBDC Applicants pursuant to the constructive trusts awarded by Brown J. must be
    applied in reduction of the damage award. I understand the DBDC Applicants to
    accept that conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, I would give effect to the ground of appeal
    respecting the DBDC Applicants claim for damages against the Listed Schedule C
    Companies on a joint and several basis, subject to the foregoing caveat.</p>

  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> there was no unjust enrichment
    at the expense of the DeJong Companies resulting from the misappropriation of
    the DeJong investments;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> the diverted DeJong investments
    could not be linked to the acquisition, preservation, maintenance or
    improvement of any property owned by a DeJong Company;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> DeJong had other available
    remedies as against the Waltons and the DeJong Companies; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7 style='text-align:justify;'><span style='font-weight:normal'>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span style='font-weight:normal'> the interests of other
    creditors and third parties would be adversely affected by the award of a
    proprietary remedy in priority to all other claims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judge did not grant constructive trusts over the
    properties owned by the DeJong Companies on the basis of unjust enrichment. In
    the case of 3270 American Drive, this was because the equity funds advanced by DeJong
    for the purchase of that property were diverted elsewhere and not used for that
    purpose (it was Dr. Bernsteins investments that were improperly diverted and
    used to purchase 3270 American Drive, leading to the granting of a constructive
    trust in the DBDC Applicants favour over the property). In the case of 324 Prince
    Edward Drive, 260 Emerson Avenue and 777 St. Clarens Avenue, the DeJong monies
    were utilized, in part, for the purchase of the respective properties, but this
    did not constitute an unjust enrichment because the funds were intended to be
    used for that purpose. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Instead, the Application Judge granted constructive trusts in
    favour of DeJong against the foregoing properties as a remedy for breach of
    fiduciary duty. In doing so, he relied upon the well-accepted principle that a
    constructive trust remedy is not restricted to circumstances in which there has
    been an unjust enrichment, but may be imposed as well to hold persons in
    different situations to high standards of trust and probity and prevent them
    from retaining property which in good conscience they should not be permitted
    to retain, and can aris[e] on breach of a fiduciary relationship: <em>Soulos
    v. Korkontzilas</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 217, at paras. 17 and 19. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, in <em>Indalex Ltd., Re</em>, 2013 SCC 6, [2013] 1
    S.C.R. 271, the Supreme Court of Canada revisited the factors to be taken into
    account by a court when imposing a constructive trust as a remedy for breach of
    fiduciary duty. Speaking for the majority on this point, Cromwell J. held at
    para. 227 that a remedial constructive trust for a breach of fiduciary duty is
    only appropriate if the wrongdoers acts give rise to an identifiable asset
    which it would be unjust for the wrongdoer (or sometimes a third party) to
    retain.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[12]</span></span></span></a> Concurring on this point, Deschamps J. affirmed, at para. 78, that [i]t is
    settled law that proprietary remedies are generally awarded only with respect
    to property that is directly related to a wrong or that can be traced to such
    property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The decision whether to impose a constructive trust is
    discretionary, and there is no question that a judge of first instance is
    entitled to considerable appellate deference in the exercise of that
    discretion, absent an error in principle. Respectfully, I have come to the
    conclusion that the Application Judge erred in principle in two respects when
    he imposed a constructive trust in favour of DeJong in these circumstances:
    first, in his failure to apply the <em>Indalex</em> principle that the fiduciarys
    wrongful acts must give rise to an identifiable asset; secondly, in his failure
    to give effect or consideration to the interests of other creditors and third
    parties, and to the fact that DeJong had other remedies available to it.</p>
  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Application Judge Failed to Apply <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Indalex</span></i> </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drawing upon the Courts earlier decision in <em>Soulos</em>,
    Cromwell J. in <em>Indalex</em>, at para. 228, reiterated the four conditions
    that must be present before a remedial constructive trust may be ordered for
    breach of fiduciary duty:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1) The defendant must have been under an equitable obligation,
    that is, an obligation of the type that courts of equity have enforced, in
    relation to the activities giving rise to the assets in his hands;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) The assets in the hands of the defendant must be shown to
    have resulted from deemed or actual agency activities of the defendant in
    breach of his equitable obligations to the plaintiff;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) The plaintiff must show a legitimate reason for seeking a
    proprietary remedy, either personal or related to the need to ensure that
    others like the defendant remain faithful to their duties; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) There must be no factors which would render imposition of a
    constructive trust unjust in all the circumstances of the case; e.g., the
    interests of intervening creditors must be protected.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Referring to (2) above, Cromwell J. went on to add, at para. 230:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To satisfy the second condition, it must be shown that <span
class=Underline>the breach</span> <em>resulted in</em> the assets being in [the
    wrongdoers] hands, <span class=Underline>not simplythat there was a
    connection between the assets and the process in which [the wrongdoer]
    breached its fiduciary duty</span>. [Underlining added; italics in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, the confusion arises because, while part of the DeJong
    investments were wrongfully diverted by Ms. Walton from the DeJong Companies to
    other uses (that could not be identified because of the pooling and co-mingling
    of funds), significant portions of the investments were used for precisely the
    purposes for which they were intended: they were utilized in the acquisition of
    the four DeJong Properties identified above. In short, the wrongdoing <em>vis-à-vis</em> DeJong did not give rise to the acquisition of those assets, although overall
    there may have been a connection between them and the process through which
    the wrongdoing took place.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Application Judge does not appear to have taken these
    considerations into account in arriving at his decision to impose a
    constructive trust in favour of DeJong, yet they posed a clear impediment to
    the courts ability to do so in the circumstances, in my view. It is not enough
    to say that DeJong monies were used in the acquisition of the properties (the
    monies were intended to be used for that purpose). Nor is it sufficient to say
    for purposes of imposing a proprietary remedy  as the Application Judge does 
    that Ms. Walton breached her fiduciary obligations to DeJong by wrongfully
    transferring monies <em>out of</em> the DeJong Companies (the wrongful transfer
    did not give rise to an identifiable asset); or that the Waltons failed to
    comply with their agreements to provide capital for the acquisitions (those
    failures, similarly, did not result in the acquisition of the properties); or
    that they failed to comply with their obligations to manage the properties (a
    failure to manage would not generally give rise to a proprietary claim); or,
    simply, that the breach of fiduciary obligation led to the loss of the DeJong
    investments (the breach did not lead to the loss of the properties in question).</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Application Judge Failed to Consider the Circumstances </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The DBDC Applicants submit as well that in an insolvency context (as
    is the case here) the availability of other remedies and the adverse impact of
    imposing a proprietary remedy on other creditors and parties need to be taken
    into account in determining whether to impose a constructive trust. The
    Application Judge did not do so, they argue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are other creditors in the proceedings. A summary of the
    proposed payments accepted to date in the Claims Process indicates that the Receiver/Manager
    has accepted approximately $60,000 in secured claims (principally from the Canada
    Revenue Agency) and approximately $205,000 in unsecured claims.<a href="#_ftn13"
name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[13]</span></span></span></a> These claims are dwarfed by the claims at issue in these proceedings: Dr.
    Bernstein and the DBDC Applicants claim approximately $66 million against the
    Waltons and an included $22.6 million against the Listed Schedule C Companies;
    approximately $4 million is claimed by DeJong; and $160,000 by the Condos.<a
href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[14]</span></span></span></a> The claims by Dr. Bernstein and the DBDC Applicants themselves similarly dwarf
    the DeJong and Condos claims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is significant that DeJong and the Condos did not advance
    their funds directly on the acquisition of the properties. They advanced their
    monies to the Schedule C Companies, either as equity investments (the Condos in
    Cecil Lighthouse; DeJong in United Empire Ltd.), or as shareholder loans
    (DeJong in respect of Prince Edward Properties, St. Clarens Holdings and Emerson
    Developments).<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[15]</span></span></span></a> They each have remedies in those respective capacities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> With a minor exception concerning the St. Clarens and Emerson
    companies, the Waltons shares in the DeJong Companies have been cancelled,
    leaving DeJong as the overwhelming majority shareholder of United Empire,
    Prince Edward Properties, St. Clarens and Emerson. Those corporations owned the
    Schedule C Properties against which DeJong is claiming constructive trusts, and
    whose proceeds from sale are currently being held by the Manager. DeJong
    remains an unsecured creditor on the basis of its shareholder loans, and may well
    have a personal remedy against the Waltons. Granting a constructive trust over
    the properties, as a remedy for breach of fiduciary duty, would enable DeJong
    to leapfrog over other creditors in its capacity as a lender by obtaining a
    proprietary remedy not available to other creditors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the Application Judge did not refer specifically to the relevance
    of other creditors or other remedies available to DeJong, I am not prepared to
    assume that he ignored them, experienced Commercial List judge that he was.
    Indeed, I suspect that these factors were the very ones driving his decision.
    He would well have recognized that the claims of the DBDC Applicants would
    overwhelm those of DeJong in an insolvency competition. Although the DBDC
    Applicants outstanding losses exceed $66 million and their recovery has been
    limited to only approximately $13 million, they have nonetheless made <em>some</em> recovery. DeJong will recover very little in a priorities contest among
    creditors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, however, it is not enough to say, simply, that,
    because different groups of investors have been victims of an overall
    fraudulent scheme involving the acquisition of various commercial properties,
    and one group of investors is entitled to a constructive trust against certain
    of those properties to which their funds can be traced, the other group of
    investors is in equity entitled to a proprietary remedy against those or other
    properties in order to achieve some similar recovery in an attempt to be
    equitable. I do not see the foregoing factors as justifying the imposition of a
    proprietary remedy, for the benefit of the latter group of investors/creditors
    and to the prejudice of others, where the fiduciary breach did not directly
    relate to the acquisition of the properties in question.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I conclude that the granting of constructive
    trusts in favour of DeJong over the properties owned by the DeJong Companies
    cannot stand.</p>

    awarding damages of $22.6 million against these ten companies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my opinion, liability for knowing assistance
    in this case cannot be made out. It accepts, as evidence of both the Listed
    Schedule C Companies participation in Ms. Waltons breach of fiduciary duty,
    and the measure of the appellants damages, the net transfer analysis, a
    summary of cash transfers that was performed by the Inspector at an earlier
    stage in the oppression proceedings against the Waltons, for an entirely
    different purpose. It equates a Listed Schedule C Companys participation as a
    victim in Ms. Waltons shell game to participation in a breach of fiduciary
    duty. It imputes to the Listed Schedule C Companies Ms. Waltons conduct and
    intent, where her actions defrauded them, and were for her own personal
    benefit. And it uses as a measure of damages the sum of $22.6 million, which does
    not correspond with any proven benefit to or harm caused by any Listed Schedule
    C Company, but is simply the net amount transferred in a three-year period from
    the Schedule B Companies to Rose &amp; Thistle (without regard for its source
    or whether any of the funds ended up in a Listed Schedule C Company). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A judgment for $22.6 million against the Listed
    Schedule C Companies would enable the DBDC Applicants to share as unsecured
    creditors in the proceeds of sale of each of ten Schedule C Properties, after
    satisfying the constructive trust claims they have made out against some of the
    properties. This judgment, which purports to reflect the collective losses of
    the 29 DBDC Applicants, will overwhelm the claims of the investors in the ten
    Listed Schedule C Companies, who were victims of the Waltons in the same way as
    the appellants. As my colleague notes, this is a priorities dispute, however,
    the effect of a judgment for damages in their favour is that the DBDC
    Applicants will receive the lions share of the net proceeds of sale of
    properties to which, except for the funds that have been traced and in respect
    of which they have already been awarded constructive trusts, they made no
    contribution. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I cannot agree with this result. In my view, the
    participation element of the fault-based claim of knowing assistance is not
    made out on this record. And, in this case of first impression for our court - where
    a claim of knowing assistance in a breach of fiduciary duty is made by one
    group of defrauded investors against another similarly situated group - there
    is no reason to expand the equitable claim of knowing assistance beyond its
    proper bounds.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would therefore dismiss the DBDC Applicants
    appeal after concluding that they are not entitled to judgment for $22,680,852

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the knowing receipt and knowing
    assistance claims were late-breaking add-ons to the oppression proceedings
    against the Waltons. I do not agree that they were, as the DBDC Applicants
    contend, part of the deferred relief that was already before Brown J. It is
    important to recall what was at issue and determined in the earlier proceedings
    to ensure that the Listed Schedule C Companies are not simply carried along as
    part of the collective wrong of the Waltons against the DBDC Applicants, and so
    that the focus, as it should be, is on whether any or all of the Listed
    Schedule C Companies was a knowing participant in Ms. Waltons breaches of the
    fiduciary duties she owed to the DBDC Applicants. As such, I find it necessary
    to review the proceedings leading up to the decision under appeal.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, since the DBDC Applicants claims
    against the Listed Schedule C Companies depend on the courts acceptance of the
    net transfer analysis, its purpose and limitations must be understood. The
    net transfer analysis served a specific function in the oppression proceedings,
    to demonstrate the Waltons fraud on the DBDC Applicants. I will explain why it
    was never intended to serve as the basis for personal claims against the Listed
    Schedule C Companies, and why, in my view, it is ill-suited to this purpose. </span></p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After addressing these two related contextual
    points, I will turn to the two claims on appeal. I will explain briefly why I
    agree with my colleague that the DBDC Applicants cannot succeed in their claim
    of knowing receipt. I will then turn to knowing assistance and explain why I am
    unable to agree that the Listed Schedule C Companies are liable for having
    knowingly assisted in Ms. Waltons breaches of the fiduciary duties she owed to
    the DBDC Applicants.</span></p>

    obtain an accounting and recovery of the monies they advanced and lost. As
    such, the respondents were the Waltons, Rose &amp; Thistle and Eglinton Castle

    Bernstein, through the DBDC Applicants, invested with the Waltons) were listed
    in a schedule to the Notice of Application and named as respondents to be bound

  <p class=CQuote>(iv)  those
    transfers of funds from the Schedule B Companies to Rose &amp; Thistle
    constituted breaches of the agreements between the DBDC Applicants and the
    Waltons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The net transfer analysis does not, as the DBDC Applicants <span
lang=EN-US>contend, demonstrate that $22.6 million of the funds
    misappropriated from the DBDC Applicants were diverted to the use and benefit
    of the Schedule C Companies (DBDC Applicants Factum, at para. 57). There are
    a number of reasons why I conclude that the net transfer analysis does not
    support the claims against the Listed Schedule C Companies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the $22.6 million amount consists of the net amount
    transferred from Schedule B Company accounts to Rose &amp; Thistle (less $1
    million credited to the Waltons for proper expenses). Except as has been
    accounted for by constructive trust, the net transfer analysis does not show
    where the money went after it was transferred into Rose &amp; Thistle, or that
    any of the net money ended up in any particular Walton-controlled account
    (including any Listed Schedule C Company account). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[196]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary to what is pleaded by the DBDC Applicants, the $22.6
    million does not represent the extent to which any Schedule C Company or even
    the Schedule C Companies as a whole, were enriched by the DBDC Applicants
    monies diverted from the Schedule B accounts.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, although the net transfer analysis also indicates that
    Schedule C Company accounts received a net transfer of $25.4 million, this is
    simply the net amount that was transferred from Rose &amp; Thistle to all 54
    Walton-controlled accounts, other than the Schedule B Company accounts. It does
    not identify the source of the money coming from Rose &amp; Thistle into a
    Schedule C Company Account. Without a proper tracing, no particular Schedule C
    Company account can be said to have received the benefit of Schedule B Company
    monies. Where a tracing has occurred, a constructive trust have been awarded.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague states, at para. 80, that as a result of these net
    transfers, the Schedule C Companies acquired funding necessary for their
    ongoing operations and he refers to Brown J. accepting the Inspectors
    conclusion that <span lang=EN-US>the [DBDC] Applicants investment in the
    Companies was a major source of funds for the Walton Companies. At the time
    this finding was made by Brown J., however, the Inspector did not yet have
    access to the Schedule C Company accounts, and therefore did not consider the
    funds invested by others, such as the DeJongs and the Condos, into the Schedule
    C Properties, transfers between the Schedule C Company accounts, and the
    movement of funds between such accounts and Rose &amp; Thistle. Even if it
    could be said that the Walton or Schedule C Companies as a whole acquired
    funding for their operations, this tells us nothing about what was happening in
    the account of any specific Schedule C Company, including all of the Listed
    Schedule C Companies (which of course had also received funds from their
    investors). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I see it, the central problem with using the
    net transfer analysis as a basis for a claim against the Listed Schedule C
    Companies, is that it treats all Walton-controlled accounts in the same way,
    and as a collective, when the investors in the Listed Schedule C Companies (which
    are only a subset of the Walton-controlled companies or accounts) </span>were
    equally victims of the Waltons fraud. <span lang=EN-US>The Waltons used a
    number of corporate entities to perpetrate their fraud on the appellants and
    the respondents  the corporate entities were the pawns in their shell game.
    Some were entirely Walton-controlled, and others were investment companies set
    up in the same way as the DBDC Applicants Schedule B Companies, to be co-owned
    by investors. The DBDC Applicants point to the net funds that were transferred
    from Rose &amp; Thistle to a</span>ll Schedule C Company accounts as a
    collective, but then target only ten such companies, the ones with valuable
    property and other defrauded investors, for the purpose of their knowing
    assistance claim.</p>

    do not assist in establishing the liability of the Listed Schedule C Companies.
    Because it was designed to show the DBDC Applicants losses, the net transfer
    analysis sets up, on one side of the ledger, the accounts of the DBDC
    Applicants Schedule B Companies, and on the other, the 54 other
    Walton-controlled accounts. It stands to reason that the DBDC Applicants
    suffered the net losses, when compared to all of the Walton-controlled
    accounts. Th<span lang=EN-US>e DBDC Applicants invested much more than the
    Waltons and more than any other investor. If the Waltons failed to make their
    capital contributions and were siphoning money to their own personal accounts
    as well as moving investor money around, it follows that the amount transferred
    to Rose &amp; Thistle by the Schedule B Companies would be more than the amount
    paid out by Rose &amp; Thistle to such companies.</span></p>

    considered individually, at least nine of them were </span><em>net

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At paras. 57 to 59 of his reasons, the Application Judge
    identified the shortcomings in the net transfer analysis where he stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Referring to the example of 6195 Cedar Street Ltd.], there is
    no proof where Rose &amp; Thistle obtained the money that was transferred to
    6195 Cedar Street Ltd. It may have come from one of Dr. Bernstein's companies.
    It may not have. It may have come from investors in the Schedule C Companies
    whose money was transferred to Rose &amp; Thistle. The report does not state
    where the money came from. The same can be said for all of the Schedule C
    Companies that the applicants seek a judgment against for knowing receipt of
    trust funds. Moreover, the schedule was as of a point in time and whether the
    balance changed over time is not known as no analysis was done.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>What happened to the money transferred to the Schedule B and C
    Companies by Rose &amp; Thistle is not in evidence. On the hearing before Brown
    J., the applicants were able to establish that Dr. Bernstein's funds went into
    several Schedule C Properties and a constructive trust was ordered in favour of
    the applicants in respect of those properties. No constructive trust was
    ordered with respect to the property of the Schedule C Companies that the
    applicants now seek a judgment against, which I take to be recognition that the
    applicants did not have evidence that their money went into those properties.
    In paragraph 13 of his formal judgment of August 12, 2014, Brown J. ordered
    that the applicants were permitted to trace funds provided by the applicants
    into and through the accounts of the Schedule B Companies into the Schedule C
    Companies. However the applicants did not undertake any such tracing. <em>The
    applicants have not established that it was the applicants' money that was
    received by the Schedule C Companies in question.</em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In light of the way in which Ms. Walton transferred money
    around, I could not without a tracing analysis hold that Dr. Bernstein's money
    ended up in the Schedule C Companies against which the applicants now seek a
    judgment. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[204]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree entirely with these comments. In my opinion, not only
    does the net transfer analysis fail to establish the receipt by the Listed
    Schedule C Companies of DBDC Applicants funds for the purpose of knowing
    receipt, it also cannot support the claim against them for knowing assistance.
    Yet, the DBDC Applicants rely on the net transfer analysis as evidence of the
    Listed Schedule C Companies participation in Ms. Waltons breach of fiduciary
    duties and as the measure of their damages. I turn now to the substance of
    their claims. </p>

    overall fraud, and not the diversion of the DBDC Applicants funds to the
    Waltons personal use. At para. 57 of his reasons, he characterizes the
    pertinent question as whether Ms. Walton caused the Schedule C Companies to
    participate in her fraudulent dealings. He answers the participation
    question at para. 86, by saying that Ms. Walton <em>utilized the Schedule C
    Companies as actors</em> in the process of orchestrating her shell game through
    the Rose &amp; Thistle clearing house account, and he then describes how she
    co-mingled and diverted the funds of both the DBDC Applicants and the Listed Schedule
    C Companies, using various pretexts. Again, at para. 95, he refers to the
    Listed Schedule C Companies as actors in Ms. Waltons overall fraudulent
    undertaking in breach of her fiduciary obligations to both the DBDC Applicants
    and DeJong. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[221]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Listed Schedule C Companies may have participated in the

    moved to and from their accounts, in the same way money was moved to and from
    the Schedule B Company accounts. <span lang=EN-US>The actions of the Listed
    Schedule C Companies were the same as those of the Schedule B companies  they
    were conduits and used as part of the Waltons shell game. </span>All of the
    victims of Ms. Waltons fraud, including the Listed Schedule C Companies, may
    well have been <em>used by her</em> in the overall fraud, but, in my view, that

    transfer analysis to point to the collective benefit of the Waltons
    arrangement to the Schedule C Companies. In his view, the Schedule C Companies
    were significant net beneficiaries, they acquired properties as intended and
    they benefitted at least partly from Ms. Waltons actions (at paras. 79, 80
    and 124). He states, at para. 80, that, based on the net transfers of monies
    from the Schedule B Companies to Rose &amp; Thistle and from Rose &amp; Thistle
    to the Schedule C Companies, the latter acquired funding necessary for their
    ongoing operations and he refers to Brown J.s acceptance of the conclusion
    that the DBDC Applicants investments in the Schedule B Companies [were] a
    major source of funds for the [Schedule C] Companies (which as I have noted

style='line-height:200%'>[223]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect, I disagree with the acceptance of the net transfer
    analysis to support a finding of participation. The net transfer analysis only
    establishes that the <em>collective</em> of the 54 Walton-controlled accounts
    (consisting of all accounts controlled by the Waltons other than those of the
    Schedule B Companies) benefitted from the Waltons overall fraud, during the
    three-year period considered by the Inspector. It does not prove that any one
    or more of the ten Listed Schedule C Companies received a benefit or that this
    enabled them to acquire properties (except where constructive trusts were
    already imposed). Nor does the net transfer analysis demonstrate that any
    Listed Schedule C Company participated in Ms. Waltons diversion of the DBDC
    Applicants funds.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[224]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, even when my colleague considers the individual Listed
    Schedule C Companies (at paras. 87 to 96), he does not identify any evidence of
    their participation or assistance in the breach of fiduciary duty to the
    DBDC Applicants. Instead he refers to transfers from their accounts to and from
    Rose &amp; Thistle, saying that, with two possible exceptions, each either <em>received
    from</em> <em>or transferred to </em>Rose &amp; Thistle monies or monies-worth
    during the relevant period, and that this both meets the test for the second and
    third elements of <em>Canadian Dredge </em>and for the participation/knowing
    assistance requirement (at paras. 80, 83, 84, 95 and 96). I respectfully
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[225]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prince Edward Properties Ltd. is the Listed Schedule C Company in
    respect of which there was a net transfer from its account <em>to </em>Rose
    &amp; Thistle of $520,850 during the three-year period covered by the net
    transfer analysis. Only $100 was transferred the other way. There is no
    evidence that it benefited from or participated in the diversion of the DBDC
    Applicants funds (or even that it was a beneficiary of the Waltons overall
    fraud). There is no evidence of net Schedule B Company monies being transferred
    into this Listed Schedule C Company account, or that they were used to acquire
    its property, 324 Prince Edward Drive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[226]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The two exceptions referred to by my colleague are St. Clarens Holdings
    Ltd. and Emerson Developments Ltd., where there is no evidence of <em>any </em>transfer
    of funds between their accounts and Rose &amp; Thistle account, let alone any
    evidence of a transfer of the DBDC Applicants funds into these entities. In
    fact, as the respondents point out, since the Schedule C Properties, 777 St.
    Clarens Avenue and 260 Emerson Avenue, were acquired after the Inspector was
    appointed, and the Waltons had no access to the DBDC Applicants funds, no DBDC
    Applicant monies could have found their way into these Schedule C Companies, or
    been used to acquire their properties.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[227]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague acknowledges that there is no evidence of any
    transfer between Rose &amp; Thistle and these companies, and, at paras. 90 to 93,
    he describes how they were defrauded by Ms. Walton. He concludes that Ms.
    Waltons acts in defrauding these Listed Schedule C Companies engaged the
    Listed Schedule C Companies as actors in her overall fraudulent undertaking,
    that each of these transactions required a corporate act, and that Ms.
    Waltons acts were their acts, and the Companies accordingly participated in or
    assisted Ms. Walton in her breach of fiduciary duties to the DBDC Applicants
    (at para. 96). With respect, I disagree that participation is made out here. It
    would mean that being a defrauded entity, as part of a larger fraud, can
    constitute knowing assistance in the fraudsters breach of fiduciary duty to
    another fraud victim. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[228]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even in the case of the seven Listed Schedule C Companies where
    the net transfer analysis shows a net transfer of monies from Rose &amp;
    Thistle to their individual accounts during the relevant period (United Empire
    Lands Ltd., Bible Hill Holdings Ltd., 6195 Cedar Street Ltd., Cecil Lighthouse
    Ltd. and The Old Apothecary Building Inc., Atala investments Inc. and 1780355
    Ontario Inc.), this is not evidence of that company benefiting from, or in any
    other way participating in, Ms. Waltons breach of fiduciary duty, which is her
    diversion of funds from the DBDC Applicants. As we have seen, the net transfer analysis
    does not take into account monies that were invested directly from the Schedule
    C Company investors, including the investors in the Listed Schedule C Companies,
    or transfers between Schedule C Company accounts. </p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[229]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The only benefit that is demonstrated here is a
    net benefit to the Schedule C Companies as a collective, from the transfer of
    Rose &amp; Thistle monies. I have already identified what I view as the limits
    of the net transfer analysis. Even if more money flowed from Rose &amp; Thistle
    into a Listed Schedule C Company than what that company paid to Rose &amp;
    Thistle, this is not evidence that the Listed Schedule C Company benefited from
    or participated in the specific breach of fiduciary duty, which was the
    diversion of the DBDC Applicants funds from their intended purpose. </span></p>

    Listed Schedule C Companies participation, are that the Listed Schedule C
    Companies received and paid monies to Rose &amp; Thistle (and in some cases
    were simply defrauded by the Waltons). In my view, this conduct does not rise
    to the level of knowing assistance by the Listed Schedule C Companies in a
    breach of a fiduciary duty any more than it would engage the Schedule B
    Companies in such a breach. They were not participants acting in their own
    right to further a breach of fiduciary duty. They were </span><em>used by</em><span
lang=EN-US> the Waltons as part of a fraudulent scheme. In this regard the
    Schedule B companies and the innocent investor Schedule C Companies are on an
    equal footing. </span></p>

    may have participated in Ms. Waltons overall fraudulent scheme, in the sense
    that they were used by her in the shell game to co-mingle investor funds, and
    to avoid making her own contributions, the net transfer analysis does not
    provide the evidence that they participated in her breach of fiduciary duty to
    the DBDC Applicants so as to attract personal liability for knowing assistance.
    Nor is there any other evidence of their participation. In my opinion, the DBDC
    Applicants claim against the Listed Schedule C Companies should fail for this
    reason alone.</span></p>

    intent is to be attributed to a Listed Schedule C Company depends on the
    wrongful act the company committed. Because of my conclusion on the participation
    issue, I do not propose to say anything about my colleagues discussion of the
    knowledge element, except to indicate that I take issue with two points: the result
    of applying the three </span><em>Canadian Dredge </em><span lang=EN-US>criteria
    for the corporate identification doctrine in this case, and my colleagues
    suggestion that the second and third criteria should be approached in a less
    demanding fashion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[233]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> One of the reasons that my colleague
    specifically addresses whether each Listed Schedule C Company received a
    benefit is to meet the requirements of </span><em>Canadian Dredge </em><span
lang=EN-US>for attaching liability to a corporation for the fault of its
    directing mind. As he notes, at para. 69, </span><em>Canadian Dredge </em><span
lang=EN-US>instructs that where a corporations alleged wrongdoing involves
    fraud by its directing mind, the court must be satisfied that (i) the directing
    mind was acting within her assigned field of operation, and that her actions (ii)
    were not totally in fraud of the Listed Schedule C Company, and (iii) were by
    design or result partly for the benefit of the corporation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[234]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My colleagues analysis shows that there are
    difficulties meeting these requirements in this case (even if the alleged wrong
    was participation in Ms. Waltons overall fraud) because the scheme was for the
    Waltons personal benefit and defrauded the Listed Schedule C Companies, and
    because the evidence of each companys individual benefit from the scheme is
    questionable. While it is true, as my colleague notes, that knowing assistance
    does not require a defendant to have received a benefit, the issue of benefit
    is relevant here because Ms. Waltons conduct was in fraud of the very entities
    sought to be made liable for knowing assistance, and there is no other act of
    participation alleged. And, the overall net benefit to the Schedule C Companies
    is central to the DBDC Applicants claim. Without a tracing of Schedule B
    Company money into their accounts, there is no evidence that any of the Listed
    Schedule C companies benefited from the diversion of the DBDC Applicants funds
    by Ms. Walton. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[235]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>My colleague suggests, at para. 70, that the
    second and third criteria of </span><em>Canadian Dredge </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>should be </span></em><span lang=EN-US>approached in
    a less demanding fashion, because this is a civil case, where the burden of
    proof is less onerous, and because of the nature of the case (</span>a complex
    multi-real estate transaction investment fraud, perpetrated over an extended
    period of time, and implicating numerous corporate actors (operating at the
    instance of the fraudster) and numerous victims).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[236]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect, I disagree. When the <em>Canadian Dredge </em>criteria
    have been accepted and applied in civil cases, this has occurred without relaxing
    the criteria for finding a corporation is liable for a wrong, when its
    directing mind is acting fraudulently (see, for example, <em>Standard
    Investments Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</em>, at p. 493 and <em>Golden
    Oaks Enterprises Inc. (Trustee of) v. Lalonde</em>, 2016 ONSC 5313, 133 O.R.

    demanding standard is warranted here. As I see it, neither the civil burden of
    proof nor the nature and extent of the fraud would justify a less rigorous
    approach if the Listed Schedule C Companies are to be fixed with responsibility
    for the conduct of their director, Ms. Walton.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"

    requires actual and not constructive knowledge by the participant. The
    investors in the Listed Schedule C Companies did not themselves know about or
    cause the companies to participate in Ms. Waltons breach of fiduciary duty.
    The rationale for the claim is that the participants </span>actual knowledge
    of and assistance in the fraudulent conduct is sufficient to bind the
    strangers conscience so as to give rise to personal liability: <em>Air Canada
    v. M &amp; L Travel Ltd</em>., at p. 812. <span lang=EN-US>I see no
    justification in the circumstances of this case to lessen the requirement for
    knowledge before one victim of a fraud is tagged with the conduct of a
    fraudster. The conduct here was in fraud of the Schedule B Companies and their
    investors, the DBDC Applicants, </span><em>and </em><span lang=EN-US>the Listed
    Schedule C Companies and their investors, and was for the personal benefit of
    the Waltons.    </span></p>

    colleagues conclusion that the measure of damages for knowing assistance in

    jointly and severally for this amount. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[239]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under the doctrine of knowing assistance, the defendants
    liability is measured by the plaintiffs injury consequent to the trustees
    misconduct: see the P. Perell article, cited by my colleague at paras. 119 and
    127. This is because the wrong is in acting as an accessory to the principal
    breach, and the accessory is liable jointly and severally <em>with the
    principal wrongdoer. </em>This is why the accessories in the <em>Enbridge Gas </em>case
    acknowledged that, if liable, the damages would be the full amount paid by
    Enbridge as a result of the principals scheme and not just their share of the
    profit (at para. 50).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[240]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here, instead of asserting that the Listed Schedule C Companies
    are liable together with the Waltons for the <span lang=EN-US>$</span>66.9
    million amount awarded as damages for breach of fiduciary duty, the DBDC
    Applicants claim $22.6 million, which they say is the portion of that amount
    which the Schedule C Company respondents knowingly assisted the Waltons in
    diverting to the benefit of the Schedule C Companies. My colleague accepts
    this measure of damages when he states, at para. 128, that the loss is
    measured by the net transfer to the Schedule C Companies, globally, of $22.6
    million.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[241]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the $22.6 million amount, which is based on the net
    transfer analysis, is not a true measure of the damages for which the Listed
    Schedule C Companies could be liable to the DBDC Applicants for knowing
    assistance. It does not correspond with the loss caused by the actions of the
    fiduciary, or even with the loss caused by, or benefit to, some or all of the
    Schedule C Companies. It is simply the net amount transferred between the
    Schedule B Company accounts and Rose &amp; Thistle (less $1 million credited to
    the Waltons).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[242]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And even if it could be assumed that all of the $22.6 million
    transferred to Rose &amp; Thistle was a net gain to the Schedule C Companies,
    this is simply the amount by which all of the Walton-controlled accounts, other
    than the Schedule B Company accounts, would have benefited. As we have seen (at
    para. 189 above), it includes over $12 million of net transfers to Ms. Walton
    personally, to Walton Advocates, and to other Rose &amp; Thistle companies. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[243]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two of the Listed Schedule C Companies (Emerson and St. Clarens)
    received no funds from Rose &amp; Thistle under the net transfer analysis, and
    one (Prince Edward) transferred considerably more money to Rose &amp; Thistle
    than it received (see paras. 225 and 226). Even considered as a collective, the
    Listed Schedule C Companies received only the net amount of <span lang=EN-US>$4,367,204
    from Rose &amp; Thistle, according to the net transfer analysis.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[244]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, if the net amount transferred from the
    DBDC Applicants to Rose &amp; Thistle to the Schedule C Companies could be a
    proper measure of damages, the $22.6 million figure includes and therefore
    double counts the amounts the DBDC Applicants were awarded for their
    constructive trust claims (a total of $8,128,325: Brown J. at para. 264). The
    constructive trusts resulted from a tracing of DBDC Applicants funds into
    specific Schedule C Properties with reference to the transfers shown on the net
    transfer analysis. These diversions of funds into specific Schedule C
    Properties have already been accounted for, and would need to be deducted from
    the $22.6 million damages award.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span

    the DBDC Applicants damages against the Listed Schedule C Companies,
    individually or as a collective, but to further emphasize that it is an
    arbitrary and purely convenient number that emerges from the net transfer analysis,
    an analysis that was never intended to inform a claim for knowing assistance. </span></p>

    Does Not Support the Knowing Assistance Claim  </span></span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[245]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My colleague recognizes that knowing assistance is an equitable doctrine,
    however he rejects the argument that equity should not intervene in this case.
    In my view, there are important equitable concerns here that should prevent the
    court from finding the Listed Schedule C Companies liable for damages for
    knowing assistance. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[246]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the Listed Schedule C Companies would be subject to an
    award of damages that is based on equitable grounds when they themselves are
    victims of the same fraudulent conduct. <span lang=EN-US>The liability of the
    stranger in a knowing assistance claim is fault-based. To the extent that any fault
    could be found here, it results from being caught up in or used as part of the
    wrongdoers fraudulent scheme. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[247]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the Listed Schedule C Companies are tagged with damages
    based on the full extent to which all of the Walton-controlled companies (that
    is all the Schedule C Companies) benefited. The DBDC Applicants have chosen to
    proceed only against the ten Listed Schedule Companies for the full amount of
    the net transfer from Rose &amp; Thistle to all of the Walton-controlled or
    Schedule C Companies. The DBDC Applicants contend that they have limited their
    relief to these companies based on the work of the receiver/manager and for
    efficiency (<span lang=EN-US>DBDC Applicants Factum</span>, at para. 16).
    This is not a satisfactory explanation  the reality is that these are the only
    entities that have assets or proceeds worth pursuing. Even if the full $22.6
    million could be accepted as a measure of their loss from the conduct of the
    Schedule C Companies (if it were assumed that all of the net monies flowing
    into the Schedule C Companies came from the DBDC Applicants, which as I stated
    earlier is not supported on the evidence), this includes over $12 million of
    net transfers to Ms. Walton personally, to Walton Advocates, or to other Rose
    &amp; Thistle companies. To place the entire burden of the claim on the ten
    Listed Schedule C Companies, overwhelming the claims for losses of the
    investors in those companies, in my view, would be an unjust result.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[248]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I conclude that the knowing assistance remedy should not
    be utilized in these exceptional circumstances <span lang=EN-US> where one
    group of defrauded investors seeks to obtain judgment sounding in knowing
    assistance against another group that has been defrauded in a similar manner.
    The DBDC Applicants were able to trace certain funds into the purchase of
    Schedule C Properties, including five of the Listed Schedule C Company
    properties and to obtain a constructive trust that gives them priority over the
    proceeds of sale of such properties. I agree with my colleague that the remedy
    of constructive trust, as argued by DeJong, is not available as a matter of
    law, and that the Application Judge erred in giving DeJong priority over the
    proceeds of four properties on that basis. That said, there is no question that
    DeJongs money went into the purchase of these properties (and indeed the Application
    Judge found, and my colleague accepts, that its advances were as shareholder
    loans, and that it is a creditor for the full amounts it claims). In my view,
    it would be unfair for DeJongs claims to its advances, which can be traced,
    but not in a way that would justify a constructive trust, to be obliterated by
    a damages claim of $22.6 million by the DBDC Applicants, without any evidence
    that their funds were used in any way (except where a tracing has occurred) to
    acquire these properties. This result alone is such that the equitable claim of
    knowing assistance should be denied in this case.</span></p>
  <h1>CONCLUSION </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[249]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal of
    the DBDC Applicants with respect to the knowing receipt and knowing assistance
    claims. I would allow their appeal of the DeJong constructive trust awards
    essentially for the reasons outlined by my colleague. In the circumstances,
    however, my proposed disposition would result in the priorities over the Listed
    Schedule C Properties being determined by the Receiver without regard to any
    claim to such proceeds by the DBDC Applicants, except to the extent of their

    difficulties in asserting a claim through the Schedule B Companies because
    their losses were caused by the fraudulent actions of an insider, Ms. Walton,
    and that the claim could be met with an <i>ex turpi causa</i> defence: see <i>Livent
    Inc. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche</i>, 2017 SCC 63, varying 2016 ONCA 11. The DBDC
    Applicants are the claimants, however, and their controlling and directing mind
    is that of Dr. Bernstein. There is no fraud on the part of Dr. Bernstein to be
    attributed to the DBDC Applicants. In these circumstances, there is little
    likelihood an <i>ex turpi causa</i> defence would arise, in my opinion. Nor was
    it argued.</p>

    were victims of Ms. Waltons fraudulent scheme, the Schedule C Companies were
    not victims. I respectfully disagree. The Waltons were in breach of their
    fiduciary duties to the Schedule B Companies when they diverted funds from
    these specific-purpose corporations (Brown J., at paras. 261 and 264). To the
    extent they engaged in the same conduct in relation to the Listed Schedule C
    Companies, the Waltons were in breach of their fiduciary duties to these
    parties as well. As such, the investors, and the single-purpose investment
    companies they were investing in, were all victims of Ms. Waltons fraudulent
    scheme. </p>

    Appendix A.  <span lang=EN-US>I respectfully disagree with my colleagues
    summary (at para. 11) of the relief claimed by the DBDC Applicants when they
    were before Brown J. At para. 241 of his reasons, Brown J. referred to an
    amended draft judgment the DBDC Applicants put before the court containing
    several paragraphs of relief in relation to the Schedule C Properties,
    including the claims referred to by my colleague, which were for joint and
    several liability of the Walton respondents and the Schedule C
    Companies/Properties for net proceeds diverted from the Schedule B Companies.
    However, there is no other reference in Brown J.s reasons to any claim for any
    amount of money by the DBDC Applicants against the Schedule C Companies, or to
    an amendment of the application to permit such a claim to be made.</span></p>

    used to purchase or discharge encumbrances on Schedule C Properties: 14 College
    St.: $1,314,225; 3270 American Drive: $1.032 million; 2454 Bayview: $1.6
    million; 346E [346F] Jarvis St.: $937,000; 44 Park Lane Circle: $2.5 million; 2
    Kelvin Street: $221,000; 0 Trent [0 Luttrell]: $152,900; and 26 Gerrard Street:
    $371,200. He granted constructive trusts in favour of the DBDC Applicants in
    respect of each of these properties for the proportionate share of the purchase
    price that these amounts represented at the date of purchase and for any
    proportionate share of the increase in value to the date of realization (at
    paras. 264-267).  </p>

    duties she owed as a director of the Schedule B Companies. The problem with
    asserting a claim through these entities however is that because their losses
    were caused by the fraudulent actions of an insider, the claim could be met
    with a defence of <i>ex turpi causa. </i>See, for example, <i>Livent Inc. v.
    Deloitte &amp; Touche</i>, 2016 ONCA 11, appeal allowed in part, 2017 SCC 63.   </span></p>

    with knowing receipt by requiring a benefit to have been received by a Listed
    Schedule C Company before knowing assistance is made out. While knowing
    assistance and knowing receipt are distinct wrongs, in this case the DBDC
    Applicants themselves rely on the same alleged fact  the diversion of their
    monies into the Listed Schedule C Properties  to support both claims. No other
    form of participation is alleged.       </span></p>

    expressed the view that courts retain the discretion to refrain from applying
    the corporate identification doctrine where, in the circumstances of the case,
    it would not be in the public interest to do so (at para. 104). There is no
    policy reason for the corporate identification theory to apply to impose
    liability on the Listed Schedule C Companies for Ms. Waltons fraudulent
    breaches of fiduciary duty to the DBDC Applicants.    </span></p>

    seeks to address at para. 130. Rather, the Listed Schedule C Companies could
    not have been the beneficiaries of amounts already accounted for by their tracing
    into specific properties in the constructive trust claims, and the inclusion of
    these amounts in their damages would double count such amounts.   </span></p>
