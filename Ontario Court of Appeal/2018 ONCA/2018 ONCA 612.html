    following a judge alone trial on one count of sexual assault, contrary to <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 271.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span

    co-workers working on temporary contracts as nurses in a northern Ontario
    community. The events leading to D.A.’s conviction occurred when the
    complainant was visiting his apartment after work for drinks and company.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The complainant testified that as
    she was leaving, D.A. overpowered her, pinned her on a bed, and touched her
    sexually, without her consent. She fought him off and left.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>D.A. testified and provided a starkly
    different account. He claimed that the complainant initiated kissing and sexual
    touching with him. He put an end to it after thinking about his girlfriend. He
    said the complainant left, uneventfully.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge convicted D.A.,
    applying the principles of <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 and <i>R.
    v. J.J.R.D.</i> (2006), 218 O.A.C. 37, [2006] O.J. No. 4749. He found that
    based on a considered and reasoned acceptance of the complainant’s evidence,
    the Crown proved the offence beyond a reasonable doubt, and that D.A.’s
    testimony did not leave him with a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In arriving at this conclusion,
    the trial judge found that there was evidence supporting the complainant’s
    version. He found that a tear to the complainant’s bra was “some
    corroboration”, and that evidence that the complainant’s glasses were left at
    D.A.’s apartment supported her claim that there had been a struggle.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'><span

    text message exchange the day after the visit, which he characterized as
    “telling.” In that exchange the complainant said, “what u did last night was
    not cool”. “I told u in Kash that one night and last night and u didn’t listen
    to me at all last night”. D.A. replied “My bad … One night in Kash?”</span></p>
  <p style='

    evidence of a small mark on the complainant’s neck where she testified D.A. bit
    or pinched her.</span></p>
  <p style='

    arguing that the trial judge’s acceptance of the complainant’s evidence was not
    “considered and reasoned” because it was tainted by error. Specifically, D.A.
    claims that:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found
    that the complainant had deleted text messages and therefore her evidence had
    to be given increased scrutiny, but then failed to apply that increased
    scrutiny.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>B.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge failed
    to give appropriate weight, without explanation, to contradictory testimony the
    complainant gave about the duration of unwanted touching under her shirt that
    occurred shortly after she arrived at the apartment.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>C.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    discounted an implausibility argument offered by the defence by relying on the
    complainant’s understandable lack of recall about the details of the physical
    struggle, when the complainant did not assert a lack of recall.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>D.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    improperly treated the torn bra as independent corroboration, when the relevance
    of the tear depended upon the complainant’s testimony that the bra was torn
    during the sexual assault.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'>E.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    prevented defence counsel from pursuing an appropriate line of
    cross-examination about the complainant’s claimed dissatisfaction with her
    video statement, by mistakenly ruling that a question asked in
    cross-examination was repetitive.</p>

    a determination concerning the complainant’s credibility absent an error of law
    or an overriding error of fact: <i>R. v. Gagnon</i>, 2006 SCC 17, [2006] 1

    find this challenge to the evidence to be compelling. That was his decision to
    make.</span></p>

    provided a more complete explanation for discounting the importance of the
    inconsistency, but it was not a legal error to have failed to do so. His
    reasoning path is apparent on the record. The inconsistency relied upon, if it
    exists at all, is slight. In this context, the trial judge’s reference to it as
    an “apparent inconsistency” reflects his finding that any contradiction that

    judge erred by discounting the implausibility argument. In her
    examination-in-chief, the complainant testified that D.A. pinned her arms with
    his legs and put his hand under her shirt, but during cross-examination she
    said that she did not know exactly how her arms were pinned and that she was
    focused on manipulating her body. We appreciate that during cross-examination
    she was describing the later stages of the alleged struggle. Nonetheless, she
    was explaining the difficulty in describing relative body positions during a
    struggle. In these circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to rely on the
    complainant’s lack of perfect recall about the details of the physical struggle
    to reject an implausibility argument that depended upon a precise description
    of relative body positions.</span></p>

    his hand under her shirt at the same time is simply not sufficiently compelling
    to support a finding by this court that the trial judge’s failure to act on the
    implausibility argument undermines the considered and reasoned basis for his
    decision to accept the complainant’s evidence.</span></p>

    trial judge erred by treating the torn bra as “some corroboration of the
    complainant’s version” of events. We do not understand the trial judge, in
    using the term “some corroboration”, to be suggesting that the technical legal
    standards of corroboration had been met. He was communicating no more than that
    the torn bra provides support for the allegation. We say this because sexual
    assault is not an area of the law where technical corroboration is required:
    see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>F.H. v. McDougall</i>, 2008 SCC 53, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41, at
    para. 81. The trial judge would have had no reason to invoke the technical
    legal concept. Moreover, where corroboration is required as a matter of law,
    evidence either satisfies the elements of corroboration or it does not: <i>R.
    v. Zou</i>, 2017 ONCA 90, 346 C.C.C. (3d) 490, at paras. 40-41 (describing the
    common law rule); and <i>Vetrovec v. The Queen</i>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, at p.
    832 (describing <i>Criminal Code</i> requirements).</span></p>

    judge’s use of the term “some corroboration” that he was not claiming that the
    technical demands of the law of corroboration were met. As Doherty J.A. said in <i>Zou</i>, at para. 42, “a proper contextual reading of the reasons will
    sometimes demonstrate that the trial judge used the word ‘corroboration’ in a
    more limited sense” as opposed to its legal sense. Here, a fair reading of the
    reasons and the record indicate that he was referring to the torn bra as
    “supportive” or “confirming” the complainant’s version of events. He was not
    referencing “corroboration” in its legal sense.</span></p>

    lacks the independence required to provide logical support for the
    complainant’s testimony. The condition of a physical object or thing can be
    readily observed, without the testimony of a witness: see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>R.
    v. Kiss</i>, 2018 ONCA 184, at paras. 61-63. An object, or a photo of the
    object, is therefore additional evidence that exists independently of the
    witness and can support the testimony of the witness.</span></p>

    can be given to the condition of an item or thing will be diminished where the
    link between that item or thing and the event depends on the testimony of the
    witness for which the item or thing is offered to support. It is not an error,
    however, for a trial judge to find testimony to be supported by the production
    of a thing by the witness that is in a condition that is consistent with the
    testimony the witness provides: see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>R. v. A.G.W.</i>, 2017
    ABCA 247, at para. 23, affirmed 2018 SCC 9. This is particularly so where, as
    here, no suggestion has been made that the object has been tampered with.</span></p>

    entitled to rule that the cross-examination about the complainant’s
    satisfaction with the police video interview was repetitive. This was not a
    central line of questioning and D.A.’s point had already been made. As this
    court held in <i>R. v. McLaughlin</i> (1974), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 562 (Ont. C.A.),
    at p. 572, a “trial judge has the right and the duty to restrict
    cross-examination in all cases where the evidence sought to be obtained is
    irrelevant, repetitive or in any other manner incompatible with a fair and
    proper trial.” See also <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, 2004 SCC 5, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 193,
    at para. 44. The trial judge’s decision to move counsel along was not an
    improper interference in the right of cross-examination.</span></p>
