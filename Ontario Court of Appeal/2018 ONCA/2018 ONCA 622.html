    of the Superior Court of Justice dated January 16, 2017, with reasons reported
    at 2017 ONSC 243.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Strathy C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gloria
    Payne and her husband Hilary Payne (the “appellants”) appeal the dismissal of
    their action alleging negligent investigation, malicious prosecution, abuse of
    process and <em>Charter</em> damages, arising out of the respondents’
    investigation of a fire at a house in Windsor, Ontario, which the appellants rented
    to university students.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants
    purchased a house on Mill Street, near the University of Windsor, in 1996 (the
    “Mill Street house” or the “house”). It was a two-storey building with a
    basement and a loft above the second floor. There were seven bedrooms, which
    the appellants rented to students on an individual basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Mill
    Street house was classified by the City as a “duplex”, although it was clearly
    not one. Following a previous fire at the house in 1999, a Fire Prevention
    Officer identified several violations of the provisions applying to duplexes in
    Ontario Regulation 388/97, passed under the <em>Fire Protection and Prevention
    Act, 1999</em>, S.O. 1999, c. 4 (the “<em>Fire Code</em>”). The officer
    prepared a report noting the violations and requiring compliance by the owners.
    The appellants never received the report. The City did not follow up with the appellants
    to confirm the status of the Mill Street house.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the 1999 fire, the appellants continued to rent the seven bedrooms to
    individual occupants. By early 2006, there were five individuals living in the
    house. On the night of January 25, 2006, one resident intentionally started a
    fire. There were five people in the house at the time of the fire: four
    residents and one guest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fire spread quickly throughout the main floor and up an open staircase to the
    second floor, and then to the loft. The evidence indicated that the fire
    separations protecting the main floor bedroom were not up to the standards
    prescribed by the <em>Fire Code</em>. The guest, who was trapped in the main
    floor bedroom, suffered critical injuries as a result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence also indicated that the fire spread rapidly up to the second floor and
    the loft, because the stairway was open and unprotected. The occupants of one
    second floor bedroom and the loft were unable to escape the fire by means of
    the stairway. Since no other fire escape was accessible, they were forced to
    jump from the roof to the ground and were injured. Two other residents escaped
    without injury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent,
    Detective Richard Cote (“Cote”), an employee of the Windsor Police Services
    Board, led a police investigation into the fire. Cote was assisted by the
    respondents Mike Owens and Christine Mak of the Office of the Fire Marshal (the
    “OFM”), and the respondent Richard Marr of the Windsor Fire and Rescue Services
    Department. The respondent Mario Sonego was the Chief Building Official for the
    City of Windsor (the “City”) at the time of the fire.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    investigation revealed that the Mill Street house was being used as a boarding,
    lodging and rooming house despite its classification in City records as a
    duplex, and that the house breached a number of requirements in s. 9.3 of the <em>Fire
    Code</em> applicable to boarding, lodging and rooming houses. These included
    the absence of a fire separation between the first and second floors, allowing
    the rapid spread of fire, inadequate fire separations between the rooms, and
    insufficient protection in stairways.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the breaches of the <em>Fire Code</em>, the extensive damage and the severity
    of the resulting injuries, Owens directed Cote’s attention to s. 436 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. That section, which is described in the marginal note as “arson by
    negligence”, provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(1) Every person who owns, in whole or in part, or
    controls property is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
    for a term not exceeding five years where, as a result of a marked departure
    from the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would use to prevent
    or control the spread of fires or to prevent explosions, that person is a cause
    of a fire or explosion in that property that causes bodily harm to another
    person or damage to property.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2) Where a person is charged with an offence under
    subsection (1), the fact that the person has failed to comply with any law
    respecting the prevention or control of fires or explosions in the property is
    a fact from which a marked departure from the standard of care referred to in
    that subsection may be inferred by the court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cote undertook a
    criminal investigation in relation to the appellants regarding possible charges
    of arson by negligence. He swore in the Information to Obtain a search warrant that
    he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that they were guilty of an
    indictable offence. Following his investigation, Cote charged the appellants with
    arson by negligence contrary to s. 436.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charge against
    Gloria Payne was subsequently withdrawn when it became clear that she was not
    involved in the operation of the Mill Street house and her husband Hilary Payne
    admitted that he had control of the premises. The charges against Mr. Payne
    proceeded to a preliminary inquiry.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The preliminary
    inquiry judge found that there was insufficient evidence to make out the
    essential elements of the offence of arson by negligence. He found that there
    was no causal link between the spread of the fire and the resulting bodily
    harm. Further, the judge was not satisfied that Mr. Payne possessed the
    requisite <em>mens rea</em>. The confusion over the classification of the Mill
    Street house as a duplex or a boarding, lodging and rooming house, and the
    failure of City employees to notify the appellants that the Mill Street house
    was operating contrary to the <em>Fire Code</em>, meant that Mr. Payne was not
    morally blameworthy. The preliminary inquiry judge discharged him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants subsequently
    brought this action alleging negligent investigation, malicious prosecution and
    abuse of process against the individual respondents and seeking to hold their
    employers (the OFM, the Windsor Police Services Board, the Windsor Fire and
    Rescue Services Department, and the City) vicariously liable. The appellants also
    sought s. 24 damages for violations of their s. 7 <em>Charter</em> rights.<a

  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The TRIAL Judge’s Reasons</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    considered as a threshold issue whether he was bound by the factual findings of
    the preliminary inquiry judge. He concluded that he was not. Cote, Owens and
    Mak were simply witnesses at the preliminary inquiry. The other respondents did
    not participate in the preliminary inquiry at all. Moreover, the evidentiary
    record at the preliminary inquiry was considerably different than at trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge proceeded
    to consider whether the elements of the torts of malicious prosecution and
    abuse of process had been proven. The appellants argued that the City and the
    OFM pressured Cote to lay criminal charges against them for the improper
    purposes of discouraging landlords from renting houses to students and
    “cracking down” on illegal student housing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found
    that Cote acted independently in charging the appellants. There was no evidence
    that anyone pressured him to lay the charges. The respondents had acted in good
    faith, without malice or negligence. He found as a fact, at para. 70, that Cote
    laid the charges “because he honestly concluded that he had reasonable and
    probable grounds to believe that an offence had been committed, and not for any
    ulterior or improper purpose, nor as a result of any malice towards the
    plaintiffs.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He came to similar
    conclusions with respect to Owens and Mak, finding that there was no evidence
    that they desired or intended that the plaintiffs be charged, nor that they
    subverted the investigation, and indeed that they acted in good faith in the
    execution of their duties. He found that this was a complete defence to all
    personal claims against them and dismissed the action against them in its
    entirety.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the trial
    judge’s finding that no malice had been proven, he dismissed the appellants’ claims
    based on malicious prosecution and abuse of process. No appeal is taken from
    that disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then
    turned to the appellants’ <em>Charter</em> claim. The appellants argued that
    the police were liable for a breach of their s. 7 rights for proceeding with charges
    without reasonable and probable grounds, even in the absence of malice.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted
    that the fatal flaw in the appellants’ <em>Charter</em> claim was that they had
    brought it against individual defendants and not against the state. Further, he
    found that the appellants were “attempting to advance a malicious prosecution
    claim in the guise of a s. 24 <em>Charter</em> claim, in an effort to get
    around the clear requirement that malice be proven.” Finally, the appellants’ <em>Charter</em> claim rested on the argument that the laying of the charges was arbitrary state
    action because the <em>Fire Code</em> definition of a boarding, lodging and
    rooming house was vague. The judge disagreed. He found that the definition is
    “capable of being understood by an ordinary person based on the plain language
    used and the application of common sense.” He dismissed the appellants’ <em>Charter</em> claim.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the appellants’
    claim of negligent investigation, the trial judge noted the general rule that
    expert evidence is required to determine professional negligence. There was no
    evidence before him as to the prevailing standard of care, nor any evidence
    that Cote had breached that standard. However, the trial judge noted that
    “[t]he requirement of reasonable and probable grounds for arrest and
    prosecution informs the standard of care applicable to some aspects of police
    work, such as arrest and prosecution”: <em>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional
    Police Services Board</em>, 2007 SCC 41, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 129, at para. 55.
    Since the issue of whether Cote had reasonable and probable grounds to believe
    that the appellants were guilty of arson by negligence was a nontechnical
    matter within the knowledge and experience of the ordinary person, it fell
    within the exception to the rule requiring expert evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    considered whether Cote had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the
    appellants had committed arson by negligence contrary to s. 436 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge was
    satisfied, on all the evidence, and found as a fact that the Mill Street house
    was a “boarding, lodging and rooming house” within the meaning of s. 9.3 of the <em>Fire Code</em>, which applied to the house. Cote had reasonable and
    probable grounds to believe: (a) that the appellants owned the Mill Street
    house at all material times; (b) that s. 9.3 of the <em>Fire Code</em> applied
    to the house because it was being operated as a boarding, lodging and rooming
    house; (c) that a marked departure from the standard of care could be inferred from
    the appellants’ failure to comply with s. 9.3 of the <em>Fire Code</em>; and
    (d) that this marked departure was a cause of the spread of the fire, which in
    turn caused the damage or injury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    concluded that Cote’s belief that he had reasonable and probable grounds to lay
    charges against the appellants under s. 436 was both subjectively and
    objectively justifiable in the circumstances of the case. This was not negated
    by the absence of evidence of the appellants’ “moral blameworthiness”. Cote had
    reasonable grounds to believe the elements of the offence existed. He did not
    need to go beyond that assessment. The trial judge noted that Cote was not
    required to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case for conviction before laying
    the charges: <em>R. v. Storrey</em>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 241, at p. 251.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held
    that the failure to prove that charges were laid absent reasonable and probable
    grounds was fatal to the appellants’ claim for negligent investigation.
    Accordingly, he dismissed the claim against the individual respondents for
    negligent investigation. It followed that the vicarious liability claims
    against their employers were also dismissed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the
    trial judge dismissed the appellants’ action in its entirety.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the parties’ submissions</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Against this background of findings of
    fact firmly grounded in the evidence, the appellants acknowledge that the issue

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge set
    out the elements of the offence of arson by negligence at paras. 113-116 of his
    reasons. To establish the <em>actus reus</em> of the offence, the Crown must
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) the accused owned or controlled the property in question;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) the accused’s behaviour represented a marked departure from
    the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person would use to prevent or
    control the spread of fires or to prevent explosions; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) that the culpable behaviour was a cause of a fire, or of
    its spread, or of an explosion causing damage.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted
    that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove that the marked departure from
    the standard of care actually <span class=Underline>caused</span> the fire. It
    was sufficient that the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the marked
    departure of the owners was <span class=Underline>either</span> a cause of the
    fire, or a cause of the spread of the fire, which in turn caused damage or
    injury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the trial
    judge noted that subsection (2) provides that a marked departure from the
    standard of care may be inferred by the court where the owner fails to comply
    with any law respecting the prevention or control of fires – in this case, the <em>Fire
    Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The leading case on s.
    436 is the decision of this court in <em>R. v. Harricharan</em> (1995), 23 O.R.
    (3d) 233 (C.A.), which was considered by the trial judge. The majority, Morden A.C.J.O.
    and Catzman J.A., agreed that the section imposes a duty to control the spread
    of a fire that, in turn, causes bodily harm or damage to property, even if the
    fire was originally caused by some agency other than that of the accused. The <em>actus
    reus</em> of the offence is an act or omission that is a breach of the duty to
    prevent or control the spread of fires. Morden A.C.J.O. noted, at para. 40,
    that “[t]he accused, as a result of a breach of the duty, may be ‘a cause’ of
    the spread of a fire that, in turn, causes bodily harm or damage. He is,
    therefore, ‘a cause’ of a fire that causes injury or damage.” All three members
    of the court, Morden A.C.J.O., Catzman and Abella JJ.A., agreed that the Crown
    must prove a causal connection between the accused’s breach of duty, the
    resulting spread of the fire and the bodily injury or damage to property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants say
    that Cote did not have actual or objectively reasonable grounds to charge them with
    the offence, because he knew or ought to have known that they did not have the
    requisite <em>mens rea</em>. Cote, they say, failed to consider whether they knew
    or ought to have known that the house violated the <em>Fire Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This raises the issue
    of the requisite <em>mens rea</em> in negligence-based criminal cases such as
    this.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Beatty</em>,
    above, a case dealing with the offence of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle
    (s. 249(4)), the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that the modified objective
    test remains the appropriate test to determine the requisite <em>mens rea</em> for negligence-based criminal offences. Charron J., who gave the majority
    judgment, summarized the test in terms of both the <em>actus reus</em> and the <em>mens
    rea</em> of the offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charron J. defined the <em>actus reus</em> by the words of the statute. The trier of fact was required
    to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, viewed objectively, the accused
    was driving in a manner that was “dangerous to the public, having regard to all
    the circumstances…”: see <em>Beatty</em>, at para. 43.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the <em>mens
    rea</em>, Charron J. stated that in making the objective assessment, the trier had
    to be satisfied on the basis of all the evidence, including any evidence about
    the accused’s actual state of mind, that the conduct amounted to a marked
    departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in
    the accused’s circumstances. If an explanation is offered by the accused, then
    in order to convict the trier must be satisfied that a reasonable person in
    similar circumstances ought to have been aware of the risk and of the danger
    involved in the conduct manifested by the accused: <em>Beatty</em>, at para.
    43.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She noted, however,
    that the requisite <em>mens rea</em> can be satisfied by applying the modified
    objective test. Unlike offences that can only be committed if the accused has a
    subjective <em>mens rea</em>, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that
    the accused had a positive state of mind such as intent, recklessness or
    willful blindness. Charron J. noted, at para. 48:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[W]hile proof of subjective <em>mens rea</em> will clearly
    suffice, it is not essential. In the case of negligence-based offences such as
    this one, doing the proscribed act with the absence of the appropriate mental
    state of care may instead suffice to constitute the requisite fault. The
    presence of objective <em>mens rea</em> is determined by assessing the
    dangerous conduct as against the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.
    If the dangerous conduct constitutes a “marked departure” from that norm, the
    offence will be made out.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> McLachlin C.J. who,
    with Binnie and LeBel JJ., concurred in the result, made the following
    important observation about the elements of the offence, at para. 58:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The jurisprudence of this Court offers assistance on what

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLachlin C.J. referred
    again, at para. 62, to her majority decision in <em>R. v. Creighton</em>. In
    that case, at pp. 73-74, McLachlin C.J. set out a line of inquiry for cases of
    penal negligence. The first question is whether the <em>actus reus</em> is
    established. The <em>actus reus</em> will be established where the negligence
    constitutes a marked departure from the standards of the reasonable person in
    all the circumstances of the case. She continued:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The next question is whether the <em>mens rea</em> is
    established. As is the case with crimes of subjective <em>mens rea</em>, <span
class=Underline>the </span><span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>mens rea</span><span
class=Underline> for objective foresight of risking harm is normally inferred
    from the facts.</span> The standard is that of the reasonable person in the
    circumstances of the accused. <span class=Underline>If a person has committed a
    manifestly dangerous act, it is reasonable, absent indications to the contrary,
    to infer that he or she failed to direct his or her mind to the risk and the
    need to take care. However, the normal inference may be negated by evidence
    raising a reasonable doubt as to lack of capacity to appreciate the risk.</span> Thus, if a <em>prima facie</em> case for <em>actus reus</em> and <em>mens rea </em>are
    made out, it is necessary to ask a further question: did the accused possess
    the requisite capacity to appreciate the risk flowing from his conduct? If this
    further question is answered in the affirmative, the necessary moral fault is
    established, and the accused is properly convicted. If not, the accused must be
    acquitted. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning to the offence
    of arson by negligence, the <em>actus reus</em> is defined in s. 436(1) as a
    “marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonably prudent person
    would use to prevent or control the spread of fires or to prevent explosions”.
    And subsection (2) contains a statutory inference that the failure to comply
    with any law respecting the prevention or control of fires or explosions in the
    property is a fact from which a marked departure from the standard of care may
    be inferred. If the requisite marked departure, aided by the statutory
    inference, is present, it is reasonable for the trier to infer that the accused
    failed to direct his or her mind to the risk and to the need to take care. It
    remains open, of course, to point to other evidence or an explanation of the
    accused’s conduct, to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether a reasonable
    person in similar circumstances would have been aware of the risk. I agree with
    the respondents’ submission that the trier of fact must consider evidence about
    the actual state of mind of the accused, if any, to determine whether it raises
    a reasonable doubt about whether a reasonable person in the position of the
    accused would have been aware of the risk created by the accused’s conduct.
    And, if there is no such evidence, to convict.</p>

    appellants’ ownership of the house, and in the case of Mr. Payne, his control
    of the house, the terms of the <em>Fire Code</em>, the evidence of their breach
    and the statutory inference of a marked departure from the standard of care, Cote
    had reasonable and probable grounds with respect to all of the elements of the
    offence, including both <em>actus reus</em> and the <em>mens rea</em>. The
    marked departure from the norm flowing from the statutory inference
    demonstrates sufficient blameworthiness to support penal liability: see <em>Beatty</em>,
    at para. 36.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it happened, Mr. Payne
    was discharged at the preliminary hearing, apparently on the basis that there
    was no evidence that he had the necessary <em>mens rea</em> because there was
    no evidence that he had ever been informed that the house was classified as a boarding,
    lodging and rooming house or was otherwise operating contrary to the <em>Fire
    Code</em>. Whether that determination was correct, in light of the statutory
    inference, is not before us. What it does illustrate is that notwithstanding
    the objectively dangerous conduct and the inferences, statutory or otherwise,
    flowing from it, it remains open to an accused to point to evidence raising a
    reasonable doubt about whether a reasonable person in his or her position would
    have been aware of the risk created by that conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span

    grounds to believe that the appellants had committed an offence under s. 436.
    He had no obligation to determine whether the charge would succeed at trial. He
    was not required to evaluate the evidence to a legal standard or to make legal
    judgments. Nor was he required to exhaust all possible investigations, to
    interview all potential witnesses prior to arrest, to obtain the accused’s
    version of events or determine that the accused had no valid defence to the
    charge, before being able to establish reasonable and probable grounds: <em>Tremblay

    have demonstrated no palpable and overriding error in his findings of fact,
    which fully support the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to arrest.
    This conclusion applies to both Mr. and Mrs. Payne, who were statutorily liable
    as joint owners of the house. Once Hilary Payne admitted that he had control of
