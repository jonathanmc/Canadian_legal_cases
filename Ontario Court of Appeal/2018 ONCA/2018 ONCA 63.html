  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 23, 2016, the appellant was convicted of three counts: being an
    accessory after the fact to murder, obstructing police, and public mischief.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a>  She appeals only
    her conviction on the accessory charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and enter an
    acquittal. In my view, a review of the trial record demonstrates that the
    appellant’s conviction was based on a theory of liability that fell outside the
    scope of the indictment. </p>
  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tyler Johnson was shot to death on November 30, 2013 in Hamilton,
    Ontario at about 3:00 a.m. Four men, Joshua Barreira, his brother Brandon
    Barreira, Chad Davidson, and Louis Rebelo, were later arrested for first-degree
    murder. The appellant and her friend Ashley Dore-Davidson were arrested for
    their alleged roles as accessories after the fact to the murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not call any evidence at trial. Trial counsel conceded
    guilt on the obstruct police and public mischief charges, but argued that the
    Crown had failed to prove the charge of being an accessory after the fact to
    murder.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The focus of the appellant’s trial was on her conduct in trying to help
    her boyfriend Joshua Barreira avoid justice. Joshua Barreira was alleged to be
    one of three men guilty of murder as a party to the shooting carried out by his
    friend Chad Davidson. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <span lang=EN-US>May 11, 2017, more than a year after the appellant’s
    trial, t</span>hree of the men, Chad Davidson, Joshua Barreira, and Brandon
    Barreira, were convicted of first-degree murder. The fourth man, Louis Rebelo,
    was convicted of manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 592 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>permits proceeding with
    an accessory after the fact charge prior to the principal’s trial. However,
    proceeding in this manner places an added burden on the Crown, because proof of
    guilt of the principal offender is an essential element of the crime of being
    an accessory after the fact: <em>R. v. Duong</em><i> </i>(1998), 124 C.C.C.
    (3d) 392 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 27.  If the principal’s murder conviction
    precedes the <span lang=EN-US>accessory after the fact trial, s. 657.2(2) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>permits evidence of the conviction to be
    admitted at trial as proof of the principal’s guilt. By proceeding with the
    appellant’s trial prior<i> </i>to the murder trial, the Crown could not rely on
    this provision and was required to prove </span>that the principal was himself
    guilty of murder. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to evidence concerning the murder and the identity and roles
    of the alleged murderers, the Crown’s case against the appellant rested on two
    main bodies of evidence: </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About three
    hours after the murder, the appellant fled the city with Joshua Barreira in a
    car registered in her name. When the car was involved in an accident, they
    abandoned the accident scene. The next day the appellant falsely reported the
    car stolen. </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>About two weeks later, the
    appellant married Joshua Barreira in a joint wedding with the shooter Chad
    Davidson and his long-time girlfriend, Ashley Dore-Davidson. The couples each
    acted as witnesses to the other’s wedding. There was evidence that the
    marriages were for the purpose of invoking the then-existing spousal
    incompetency rule.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif"'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a><sup> </sup></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the Crown had failed to prove that Joshua
    Barreira was guilty of murder. He found that only the shooter, Chad Davidson,
    had been proven guilty of murder. Since proof that the principal committed
    murder is an essential element of the charge faced by the appellant, she could
    not be convicted as an accessory after the fact to murder committed by Joshua
    Barreira.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather
    than acquitting the appellant, the trial judge proceeded to convict her on the
    basis that she had been <em>Chad Davidson’s</em> accessory by serving as a
    witness to his wedding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have concluded that a review of the trial record reveals that the scope of the
    charge faced by the appellant was limited to her actions in relation to Joshua
    Barreira and did not encompass Chad Davidson as an alternate principal
    offender. The trial judge found that the Crown had not proven that Joshua
    Barreira committed murder. Therefore the Crown had failed to prove an essential
    element of the accessoryship charge faced by the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal and enter an acquittal for the reasons that follow. </p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant advances four grounds of appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    erred in finding that witnessing a non-fraudulent wedding could constitute the <em>actus
    reus</em> for being an accessory after the fact;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    erred by interpreting the accessory charge as applying to multiple
    “transactions”;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    erred by convicting the Appellant on the basis of a theory of liability that
    fell outside the scope of the indictment and had not fairly been raised at
    trial; and</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge’s reasons for conviction were insufficient.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal on the third ground.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    explain my conclusion, I will briefly review the trial record. </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE APPELLANT’S TRIAL</h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Broad Wording of the Accessory Count </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The accessory count was framed in the broadest
    of terms.  It alleged that the appellant, in the two and one-half months
    between the date of the murder on November 30, 2013, and her arrest on February
    14, 2014, in the City of Hamilton:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>…did commit accessory after the fact to murder, contrary to the
    provisions of Section 240 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    indictment contained no information identifying how the appellant was alleged
    to have committed the offence, or the principal offender or offenders whom she
    was alleged to have helped. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s Opening Statement </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel’s opening statement referenced the appellant’s conduct only in relation
    to her boyfriend, Joshua Barreira. Although the Crown opening referred to the
    joint wedding, nothing in the opening statement signalled that the appellant
    was charged with assisting anyone other than her boyfriend, Joshua Barreira.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unsurprisingly,
    in light of the Crown’s opening statement, defence counsel’s focus throughout
    the trial was on Joshua Barreira’s culpability for murder, and the appellant’s
    conduct in assisting Joshua Barreira.  </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Evidence at Trial </h2>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Homicide
    officer Detective Sergeant Jason Cattle testified that Tyler Johnson was killed
    by a single shot to the chest outside a restaurant in downtown Hamilton shortly
    after 3:00 a.m. on November 30, 2013.  The relevant events were captured on
    surveillance videos, some of which were played during Detective Cattle’s
    testimony. The footage showed Chad Davidson and Joshua Barreira walking
    together toward the victim. Brandon Barreira and Louis Rebelo are also seen in
    the vicinity of the victim. Davidson is seen holding a handgun at his side.
    After a brief struggle, Davidson fired a fatal shot into the victim’s chest. 
    The four men then fled the scene. </p>

    shoulder. The badly damaged car was in the middle of the highway. </span></p>

    approached the accident scene, someone “screamed out that that was Josh’s car”.
    Mr. Puterman pulled over just past the accident scene, got out, and walked
    back.  He saw the appellant standing by herself, and Joshua Barreira soon
    appeared. Mr. Puterman told them he’d be in his vehicle whenever they were
    ready.  He returned to his vehicle, and within a few minutes, the appellant and
    Joshua Barreira got in. Mr. Puterman returned to their home in Cambridge.  The
    badly-damaged Jaguar was abandoned in the middle of the highway. </span></p>

    A recording and a transcript of the call were tendered in evidence.  The 911
    operator advised the appellant that the OPP had some involvement with her
    vehicle and she needed to contact the OPP. The appellant was given an OPP
    number to contact.  She called about an hour later and repeated her false claim
    to the OPP officer who was investigating the “fail to remain collision” involving
    the appellant’s Jaguar. She agreed to meet with the officer the following
    morning to provide a statement, but she did not attend. The officer made

    help you decide what Jennifer Dagenais’ purpose was in giving assistance, but
    Crown counsel does not have to prove that what Jennifer Dagenais did actually
    achieved that purpose. </p>

    the appellant was required to meet: a charge of being an accessory after the

    show that he recognized, correctly in my view, that the case against the
    appellant depended on proof that Joshua Barreira was guilty of murder; that she
    knew or was wilfully blind to his being a party to murder; and that she
    assisted him in trying to escape justice.  </span></p>

    form the </span><em>actus reus</em><span lang=EN-US> of the offence of
    accessoryship. In support of this submission, he relied on </span><em>R. v.

    the appellant was charged only in relation to her conduct on behalf of Joshua
    Barreira.</span></p>

    his oral reasons for judgment on the return date, he identified what he
    understood to be three bases of potential liability of the appellant: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. That she was assisting Joshua Barreira to escape when a
    motor vehicle accident occurred on November 30, 2013;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. That by marrying Joshua Barreira and thus creating her right
    to invoke the spousal incompetency rule relative to testimony, she was
    assisting Joshua Barreira to avoid criminal liability; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. That by serving as a witness to the marriage of Chad
    Davidson and Ashley Dore-Davidson, she assisted the former to avoid criminal
    liability by permitting the latter to invoke the spousal incompetency rule.<b> </b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge commented on what he understood
    to be the third basis of liability by stating: “if the third point sounds
    convoluted, that is because it is convoluted.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, the trial judge erred in
    identifying the appellant’s actions in relation to Chad Davidson as an
    alternative theory of the Crown.  As I have stated, my review of the trial
    record reveals that the appellant was not facing a charge involving Chad
    Davidson as the principal to her accessoryship charge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that “the Crown has failed
    to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Joshua Barreira was a party to the
    killing”.  He concluded, however, that the evidence did establish Chad
    Davidson’s guilt for murder. Since Joshua Barreira had not been proven guilty
    of murder, the appellant could not be convicted for her conduct in helping him
    escape justice: <i>Duong, </i>at para. 27. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found, however, that by
    witnessing the Dore-Davidson wedding, the appellant provided assistance to Chad
    Davidson to avoid justice, and that “at least part” of her purpose was to “help
    him avoid criminal liability”. Based on those findings, he convicted the
    appellant of the accessory charge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I note as well that in his reasons for sentence,
    on April 15, 2016, the trial judge acknowledged that the appellant’s conviction
    was founded on a theory of liability that had not been advanced by the Crown. 
    He stated:  “there is merit in defence counsel’s observation that <u>my route
    to the finding of guilt here was not one put forth by the Crown</u>” (emphasis
    added). </span></p>
