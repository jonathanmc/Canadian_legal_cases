    s. 7(5) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 to set
    aside the order of the chambers judge, dismissing his motion for an order
    extending the time within which to serve and file a notice of appeal from the
    trial judge’s decision rendered on January 24, 2018. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I will explain, I would allow the motion and
    grant the extension.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applicant represented himself during the 21-day
    trial, which took place in the Family Court Branch of the Superior Court of
    Justice in Ottawa. He claimed retroactive spousal support, and asserted a
    constructive trust interest in the respondent’s assets on the basis of unjust
    enrichment or a joint family venture. Further, he sought the return of 49 of
    his shares in </span>Turtle Island Staffing Inc. (formerly 2093030 Ontario
    Inc.) <span lang=EN-US>or payment for the shares, which he alleged had been
    transferred to the respondent by means of forgery. The total value of his
    claims was approximately $4.5 million. At the close of the trial, the trial
    judge reserved her decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Some nine months later, the trial judge issued a
    107-paragraph decision dismissing the applicant’s action. She found that
    although the parties had been in a romantic relationship, it was not a spousal
    relationship. Consequently, the applicant’s claims for spousal support and a
    constructive trust interest in the respondent’s property on the basis of a
    joint family venture failed. As to his unjust enrichment claim, the trial judge
    found that the applicant had been compensated for his services in relation to
    the respondent’s properties. Finally, the trial judge found that there was no
    evidence to support the applicant’s claim that the respondent had improperly
    taken his shares in Turtle Island Staffing Inc. Costs were awarded to the
    respondent in the total amount of $251,028. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the decision was released on January 24,
    2018, it was emailed to the applicant who was in Australia at the time. He made
    arrangements to rush back to Canada to deal with his proposed appeal. The trial
    transcripts were ordered on February 20, 2018. The applicant prepared a notice
    of appeal and served the respondent within the 30 days provided in the rules,
    on Friday, February 23. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unfortunately, upon attempting to file the
    notice with proof of service, he discovered that the information he had been
    provided as to the appropriate appellate court was in error. The materials he
    served on the respondent took the form of an appeal under the <em>Family Law
    Rules</em>, and were addressed to the Superior Court of Justice rather than to
    the Court of Appeal. As a result his materials were refused by the court office. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is understandable that the applicant, who was
    self-represented at the time, was mistaken as to the appropriate forum in which
    to advance his appeal. When he was informed of this error, he acquired the
    requisite forms and began to prepare a new notice of appeal directed to this
    court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The following day, Saturday, February 24, the
    applicant served this new notice of appeal on the respondent’s solicitor by
    email. This was 31 days following the release of the decision. A hard copy of
    the notice of appeal followed on the Monday.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applicant sought the respondent’s consent to
    the late filing of his notice of appeal. That consent was refused and the
    applicant then promptly prepared the motion for an order extending the time in
    which to file the notice of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the proposed appeal, the applicant asserts
    that the trial judge misapprehended or overlooked evidence and interfered with
    the presentation of his case. He submits that a new trial should be ordered
    because the trial judge’s reasons were inadequate and were not released until
    nine months after the trial.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>CHAMBERS DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the motion, the chambers judge identified the
    relevant factors on a motion for an extension of time under r. 3.02 of the <em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em>, </span>R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194<span lang=EN-US>. He was
    satisfied that the intention to appeal had been formed within the relevant time
    period and that the very short delay had been explained. He found, however,
    that the three other factors, namely prejudice to the respondent, the merits of
    the appeal and the justice of the case, did not favour granting the extension. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The chambers judge found that an extension would
    prejudice the respondent because it appeared unlikely that her substantial
    award for costs of the trial would be satisfied. He noted that another
    outstanding costs order against the applicant in a more modest amount had not
    yet been paid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for the merits of the appeal, the chambers
    judge determined that from the material that had been filed he was “unable to
    tease out anything of substance to support a claim of palpable and overriding
    error or of any material misapprehension of evidence.” He noted that this was a
    fact-based appeal, and that appellate courts do not retry cases.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The chambers judge concluded that the justice of
    the case did not warrant an extension. He noted again the unlikelihood that the
    respondent’s cost award would be satisfied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The chambers judge therefore dismissed the
    motion for extension and ordered costs to the respondent in the amount of
    $1,500.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I have noted above, the chambers judge correctly
    identified the relevant factors on a motion for an extension of time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, he erred in finding that there was prejudice
    to the respondent on the basis that her costs award was unlikely to be
    satisfied. This is not prejudice caused by the delay: see <em>Paulsson v.
    University of Illinois</em>, 2010 ONCA 21, [2010] O.J. No. 123, at para. 2; <em>D.G.
    v. A.F.</em>, 2014 ONCA 436, [2014] O.J. No. 2608, at para. 16. The delay was
    of only one day and, further, the notice of appeal, albeit to the wrong court,
    had been served within the 30 days provided in the rules. The respondent did
    not suffer any prejudice as a consequence of the very short delay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The error in the chambers judge’s analysis of
    prejudice clearly factored into his exercise of discretion. As a result, no
    deference is owed to his decision. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the merits of the appeal, I
    acknowledge that fact-based appeals are very difficult and are rarely
    successful. Based on what the self-represented applicant has filed and the
    extensive reasons of the trial judge, it is certainly difficult to discern any
    merit to the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The final consideration is the justice of the
    case. At this stage, the court must balance all of the preceding factors and consider
    any others that may be relevant: <em>Monteith v. Monteith</em>, 2010 ONCA 78, [2010]
    O.J. No. 346, at para. 20 (In Chambers). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it would be unfair to deprive the
    applicant of his right of appeal in the circumstances. The applicant is
    self-represented and the notice of appeal, albeit to the wrong court, was
    served on the respondent within the time provided in the rules. The delay in serving
    the appeal materials addressed to the appropriate court was barely one day.
    There is clearly no prejudice to the respondent and the loss of the right to
    appeal is very significant to the applicant. The trial decision rejected his
    claim for several millions of dollars and ordered him to pay costs in excess of
    $250,000.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In these circumstances, I am of the view that the
    justice of the case requires granting the extension, despite the applicant’s
    inability at this stage of the proceeding to demonstrate the merits of his
    proposed appeal. This court has recognized that, in circumstances like the
    present, even where it is difficult to ascertain the merits, “a party is
    entitled to appeal and should not be deprived of that entitlement where there
    is no real prejudice to the other side”: <em>Auciello v. Mahadeo</em>, 2016
    ONCA 414, [2016] O.J. No. 3282, at para. 14 (In Chambers); <em>Denomme v. McArthur</em>,
    2013 ONCA 694, 36 R.F.L. (7th) 273, at para. 10 (In Chambers). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In conclusion, I would allow the motion, set
    aside the chambers judge’s order dismissing the motion for extension of time and
    ordering costs to the respondent, and substitute an order granting the
    applicant an extension to serve and file his notice of appeal to 14 days
    following the issuance of these reasons. I would make no order as to the costs
    of the motion or the motion to set aside the chambers judge’s order.</span></p>

    that this error factored into the chambers judge’s exercise of discretion and
    therefore no deference is owed to his decision. I do not agree. While the
    chambers judge referred to the outstanding costs order as “some prejudice”, he
    did not rely on prejudice as a ground for refusing the extension. Instead, he
    based his decision on the lack of merit to the appeal as factored into the
    justice of the case. </span></p>
