style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal involves the discoverability of claims for damages arising
    out of construction deficiencies. The question for determination on this appeal
    is whether the motion judge erred by finding that the appellants’ claims were
    statute-barred because they were discoverable more than two years before the
    appellants issued their statement of claim.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellants’ action against the
    respondents arises out of alleged deficiencies in the construction of their prefabricated
    cottage. In May of 2006, J.D. MacKay excavated the foundation, the pier
    footings for the deck, and constructed and backfilled a stacked rock retaining
    wall. The purpose of the stone retaining wall was to ensure that the foundation
    of the cottage had the necessary depth of backfill to satisfy the requirement
    for frost protection for a foundation wall prescribed by Ontario’s </span><em>Building
    Code</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>, O. Reg. 332/12. Royal Homes Limited constructed
    the footings and foundation for the cottage and deck, then assembled the
    prefabricated cottage and deck, completing its work in July 2006. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellants allege that the
    construction of the foundation of the cottage and the stone retaining wall was
    negligent because they were built on loose soil, which caused them to migrate
    down the slope of the property. The appellants plead that the </span>Corporation
    of the Township of Lake of Bays<span class=MsoPageNumber> was negligent in its
    oversight and approval of the construction of the cottage foundation and the stone
    retaining wall.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The </span>appellants first noticed a
    problem with one of the deck piers in the summer of 2009. Specifically, they observed
    that one of the deck piers at the northeast corner of the deck behind the stone
    retaining wall had sunk about 1 ¼ inches, pullin<span class=MsoPageNumber>g the
    deck post away from the cottage. They were initially concerned that the big
    foot sono tubes supporting the deck posts had not been installed to a
    sufficient depth. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellants approached Royal Homes
    seeking warranty assistance. Royal Homes initially advised the appellants that
    these issues had nothing to do with the cottage construction because it was a
    slope problem and that these issues were not serious in any event. It then
    suggested that the sinking deck pier did not appear to be caused by the pier installation
    but that the stone retaining wall erected by J.D. MacKay behind the deck seemed
    to be settling and pulling the deck pier with it. On Royal Homes’ recommendation,
    the appellants subsequently retained Trow Associates Inc., a structural
    engineering firm, to investigate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In its September 2009 report, Trow confirmed
    that the problem to be investigated was that:  “the northeast corner of the
    deck is experiencing some settlement”.  The focus of Trow’s investigation and
    report was on determining “the appropriate course of action required to provide
    a solution to the settlement issues associated with the deck”.  Trow identified
    “a localized slope failure and/or localized consolidation of the underlying
    soils occurring at the north east corner of deck” as the root problem,
    indicating that “[t]he weight that was added by the construction of the stone
    retaining wall and the backfill that was placed behind it to raise the grade
    appears to be causing a failure of the lower retaining structure, causing it to
    move laterally towards the northeast”. With respect to the cottage, Trow also
    noted that while “this does not appear to have affected the dwelling yet, there
    is a hairline crack (less than 1 mm in width – typical of shrinkage cracks) in
    the basement floor that is located in the northeast corner of the basement”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Trow recommended several expensive investigative
    and remedial steps, including the removal of the stone retaining wall and the
    reconstruction of the deck pier foundations.  With the removal of the stone retaining
    wall, the grade against a portion of the foundation would be lowered and,
    because of frost, the underpinning of a portion of the dwelling foundation at a
    lower elevation would be required.  They also recommended further slope
    stability investigation. However, it cautioned that undertaking these steps
    “will not guarantee that there will not be any further movement of the slopes <u>in
    this area</u>” [emphasis added] but that “it should significantly slow the
    progress of any movement”. Trow did not suggest that the stone retaining wall constructed
    by Mr.&nbsp;MacKay was failing</span> <span class=MsoPageNumber>nor that there
    were any construction issues with the stone retaining wall or the cottage
    foundation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellants discussed the problems with
    Mr.&nbsp;MacKay. His view was that these types of retaining walls often settled
    a bit. He told the appellants that they should just monitor the situation and
    “wait and see” if the stone retaining wall found its own level over the next
    year or two. As a result, the appellants took no further steps at that time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Having watched the problems continue, the
    appellants retained Fowler Construction Company Ltd. to inspect the property in
    2012. Fowler recommended that a soil study be undertaken. Terraprobe Inc.
    conducted the study. In their report dated July 30, 2012, Terraprobe concluded
    that the stone retaining wall was failing and recommended that it be removed
    and reconstructed. In its report, Terraprobe opined that “the wall and backfill
    materials have moved due to some construction issues”. Specifically, Terraprobe
    stated that the wall had been built on very loose sand and fill “without
    adequate support of the wall base/toe from the downgrade slope”. Terraprobe
    recommended that “it must be confirmed that the deck piers and house
    foundations are placed on native, undisturbed soils and/or bedrock capable of
    supporting the design loads”. When Fowler commenced the remedial work in 2013,
    it discovered that the cottage foundation and footings had also been
    constructed on loose soil.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In allowing the respondents’ motion for
    summary judgment and dismissing the appellants’ action as statute-barred, the
    motion judge concluded that the appellants knew or should have known in 2009
    that there were some problems with the construction of their cottage, with or
    without the Trow report.</span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In my view, the motion judge erred in
    his approach to the question of discoverability of the appellants’ claims and
    made palpable and overriding errors in his consideration of the evidence
    related to that question.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>On the respondents’ motion for summary
    judgment, the motion judge was required to consider whether there were any
    genuine issues requiring a trial with respect to the discoverability of the
    appellants’ claims against the respondents. These claims were not limited to
    the negligent construction of the stone retaining wall built by J.D. MacKay but
    also comprised the negligent construction of the cottage foundation, as well as
    the Township’s alleged negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>However, the motion judge
    misapprehended the evidence relating to the discoverability of the construction
    issues respecting the stone retaining wall and erred in law by failing to consider
    all the criteria for discoverability. </span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In the present case, the motion judge
    determined that the Trow engineering report “alerted or ought to have alerted
    the plaintiffs to the fact that the problems were construction related and that
    they had a cause of action against the defendants”. In particular, he stated
    that the Trow report “identified that there was a failure of the stone wall
    constructed by J.D. Mackay.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The motion judge’s conclusions are
    problematic because they contain a fundamental misapprehension of the expert
    reports and reveal a flawed discoverability analysis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>First, the motion judge’s finding of
    discoverability is based on a fundamental misstatement of the Trow report. Contrary
    to the motion judge’s reasons, the Trow report stated there was a failure of <i>the </i></span><em>pre-existing lower wooden retaining structure</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, and not </span><em>the stone retaining wall</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber><i> </i></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>constructed by J.D.
    MacKay. Rather, it is the Terraprobe report that stated that the stone
    retaining wall was failing due to having been built on loose soil. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Second, the main problem suggested in
    the Trow report is “a localized slope failure and/or localized consolidation of
    the underlying soils occurring at the north east corner of deck”, not the
    construction of the stone retaining wall or the cottage and its foundations. Certainly,
    Trow indicated that the weight of the latter exacerbates the movement of the
    deck pier. However, Trow identified a “localized” slope failure or
    consolidation of the underlying soils occurring at an isolated point on the
    property, rather than human error in the construction of the stone retaining
    wall or the cottage and its foundations. This explains Trow’s admonition that
    the remedial steps may not resolve the naturally occurring issues. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The respondents argue that the
    appellants’ claim against them is statute-barred because they knew or should
    have known of any construction deficiencies on receipt of the Trow report. 
    They submit that the concern raised by Trow that there was movement in the soil
    causing the pulling away of a deck post ought to have alerted the appellants
    that Royal Homes did not, as represented, build the cottage so as to ensure
    that it would not move toward the lake despite being constructed on a slope. 
    However, the Trow report does not reveal any problems with the cottage
    construction. Indeed, the reference to a hairline crack in the basement floor
    as typical of shrinkage cracks would not reasonably give rise to any concern
    but rather serve to dismiss it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The motion judge similarly misapprehends
    the contents of the Terraprobe report. While acknowledging the appellants’
    argument that the Terraprobe report explicitly identified “construction issues”
    as the cause of the problems, the motion judge does not otherwise analyse the
    report. Rather, he appears to treat the Terraprobe report as confirming the
    issues raised in the Trow report. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>This was an error. The Terraprobe
    report’s conclusions differ importantly from those of the Trow report with
    respect to the issue of discoverability. Terraprobe identified the cause of the
    problems to be the negligent construction of the stone retaining wall on loose soil,
    which could have been prevented, and not the isolated, naturally occurring localized
    slope and/or soil problems raised by the Trow report. Further, the Terraprobe
    report raised for the first time the possibility of problems with the
    construction of the cottage foundation that had to be investigated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The motion judge further erred by
    concluding that even without the Trow report, the appellants would have known
    that “their cottage was not constructed properly” and that they had a claim
    against the defendants because they had been “assured that their new cottage
    would be built on a stable foundation and that they could leave their problems
    with the site conditions behind once the new cottage was built.”  However, there
    was no evidentiary basis for the appellants to reasonably suspect that there was
    anything wrong with the cottage or its foundation until receipt of the
    Terraprobe report and its recommendation that “it must be confirmed that the
    deck piers and <u>house foundations</u> are placed on native, undisturbed soils
    and/or bedrock capable of supporting the design loads” [</span><span
class=MsoPageNumber>emphasis added]</span><span class=MsoPageNumber>.  Again,
    it must be recalled that the stated purpose of the stone retaining wall was to
    provide adequate frost cover of the deck piers and not to provide stability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The motion judge’s material
    misapprehension of the expert reports caused him to err in his discoverability
    analysis. It is not enough under s. 5(1) of the Act that the appellants were
    aware of a problem. As this court has said in </span><em>Fennell v. Deol</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2016 ONCA 249, 97 M.V.R. (6th) 1, at para. 20:<i> </i></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The date of discovery is the earlier of the two dates under s.

    first ought to have had knowledge of, the matters referred to in s. 5(1)(a)(i)
    to (iv).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The question is whether the appellants
    knew or reasonably ought to have known that the problem observed with the deck
    pier in 2009 was possibly caused by the acts or omissions of the defendants and
    gave rise to a claim (as defined under the Act) that was appropriately pursued
    in a court proceeding. Royal Homes and J.D. MacKay dismissed the issues with
    the stone retaining wall and deck pier as not serious and due to settling which
    should resolve.  Until receipt of the Terraprobe report in 2012, the appellants
    did not have the requisite knowledge that their loss was not trivial and
    possibly arose from the acts and omissions of the respondents, and that it was
    appropriate to pursue their claim in a court proceeding.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Therefore, the motion judge had to
    consider whether the appellants had a claim as defined under the Act. In
    considering whether the appellants knew or should have known that they had a
    claim, the motion judge had to go on to consider whether, having regard to the
    nature of the injury, loss or damage, the appellants knew or should have known
    that a proceeding would be an appropriate means to seek to remedy it. This
    omission by the motion judge is an error of law: </span><em>Har Jo Management

  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appropriateness of bringing an

    discoverability rule. This added element can have the effect – as it does in

    beyond the date when a plaintiff knows it has incurred a loss because of the
    defendant’s actions.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>Also, when an action is “appropriate”

    commence litigation but to “wait and see” if the 1 ¼ inch sinking of the deck
    pier observed in 2009 would worsen over time or if the issue would resolve once
    the stone retaining wall had settled, as had been suggested to the appellants
    by Mr.&nbsp;MacKay. Neither Royal Homes nor Mr.&nbsp;MacKay believed the
    problem was serious, or due to the manner of construction. This evidence does
    not support the conclusion that the appellants knew or ought to have known in
    2009 that their loss was not trivial and initiating legal proceedings was the
    appropriate means to remedy their loss.</span></p>

    as part of the remediation that the Township should have required engineering drawings
    of the stone retaining wall. When Fowler started remedial work in 2013, it
    uncovered the foundation wall that had been approved by the Township and
    discovered that the cottage footings and foundation were also negligently
    placed on the same loose soil and organic materials as were under the stone
    retaining wall. There is no evidence that these material facts informing a
