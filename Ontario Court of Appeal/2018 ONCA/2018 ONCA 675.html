  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of sexually abusing his three nieces (six-month-old
    twins and a four-year-old), filming the abuse and distributing the photographs
    and movies on an Internet site devoted to the sexual abuse of children. He was
    also convicted of possession of child pornography. His collection included images
    and films of sadistic sexual abuse and sexual degradation of very young
    children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his sentence of 18 years (less 18 months’ credit for
    pre-trial custody) on his convictions after guilty pleas to counts of making
    child pornography, distributing child pornography, possessing child pornography,
    sexual assault with a weapon and three counts of sexual interference. The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with a caution. It is unfortunately necessary to describe the offences
    and the circumstances surrounding them in a degree of detail that is graphic
    and disturbing, in order to have a full appreciation of the nature and gravity
    of the appellant’s admitted conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2015, the Child Sexual Exploitation Unit of the Ontario Provincial Police
    (“OPP”), working in conjunction with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police’s
    National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre and international police
    agencies, located a child depicted in Internet child pornography known by
    investigators as the “S Series”. The abuser could be heard using the child’s
    name, “S”, in some of the videos of his abuse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    interviewing the child and her mother, police arrested the appellant, who had
    been a babysitter for his nieces, S and her twin siblings, B1 and B2.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    search warrant executed at the appellant’s home yielded two computers and an
    external hard drive containing images and films depicting the appellant’s
    sexual abuse of his nieces, a child pornography collection and postings by the
    appellant to an anonymous and secret website devoted to distribution and
    trading between producers and consumers of extreme forms of child pornography.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was ascertained that during the summer of 2012 the appellant’s three nieces
    were left in the appellant’s care while his sister-in-law worked outside the
    home. During this time, the appellant sexually abused his nieces, recorded the
    abuse, and posted some of it to a website.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    representative sampling of the images and films found on the appellant’s devices
    was introduced in evidence before the sentencing judge. This included child
    pornography unrelated to his nieces. The appellant’s collection contained images
    of vaginal and anal penetration of young children, penetration of children with
    objects and fingers, a movie of the anal rape of a boy under two years of age,
    whose arms and legs were bound by electrical tape, and an image depicting bondage
    of a four year old girl.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A sampling of
    images of B1 and B2 included images of a child’s vaginal area, insertion of the
    appellant’s penis in a child’s mouth and insertion of a candle into a child’s
    anus. These images were apparently used as part of the appellant’s “advertisements”
    on the web site. Films of one or both of the twins showed the use of an
    electric toothbrush on the infant’s vagina, digital masturbation and
    cunnilingus. In several of the films, the child was crying during the abuse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Images and films
    of S included attempted penetration of the anal and vaginal areas with an erect
    penis, digital penetration, masturbation of the clitoris, anal penetration with
    a Sharpie marker and cunnilingus. One film showed the child nude, awake and
    watching television.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from the
    child pornography he himself produced, the appellant’s child pornography
    collection included some 577 images and 243 films. The investigating officer
    testified that the volume of pornography in the collection was “not above
    average”, but there was evidence to suggest that the appellant may have erased some
    of his material. The officer described the appellant’s collection as “the most
    intrusive collection I’ve ever had to categorize.” She added, “I saw things in
    this collection I’ve never seen before in six years.” It included sadistic
    sexual acts committed against children, as well as penetration with a range of
    instruments. The officer noted that it was apparent from many of the images and
    films that “it was the discomfort of the child that was sexually pleasing to
    the person.” The Crown described it as “among the most intrusive and degrading
    image and movies that can exist”, involving infants and very young children,
    most between the ages of four and six.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge was
    also provided with a four-page written synopsis of the representative sampling,
    prepared by the investigating officer, which is part of the record before us.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing
    judge heard and observed evidence of the appellant’s activity in the world of Internet
    child pornography. The website or “boards” in which the appellant participated
    were dedicated to the sexual abuse and degradation of children. The abuse
    included anal and vaginal penetration, spanking, and urination and ejaculation
    on children’s bodies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence
    adduced before the sentencing judge was that the website used by the appellant
    for distribution of his material attracted the “upper echelon” of the child
    pornography industry – that is, those, like the appellant, who sexually abused
    children to whom they had access and recorded the abuse for the purpose of
    distribution. The officer described these individuals as the “hands-on
    offenders”. In order to become a member of the website, or to obtain entry to a
    particular site or “board”, the user had to show that he had access to a child
    and could make child pornography “to order” based on what other members wanted
    to see. To use the example given by the officer who testified at the trial, a
    member of the board might ask another member to spank or urinate on a child in
    his care.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    used various names to identify himself on the website. One was “Puffy Pudenda”.
    The officer defined “pudenda” as “the external genital organs, specifically
    those of the female, the vulva.” In May 2013, the appellant posted an
    introduction to himself on the website:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Daddy
    of three gorgeous little fuck toys. Really like to hold down my two youngest
    and spank their little asses for long periods of time, followed by extended
    forced vibrator play making them convulse, shake and piss all over the place.
    Beats using Tempera to calm ’em down.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Attached to this
    post were ten images of sexual abuse he had committed on his three nieces.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in the
    same month, the appellant posted another introduction:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Hey
    everyone just wanted to say a quick hello to tell you a bit about myself. I’m
    sure some of you have seen some of my material. I’m a daddy of three girls, all
    under the age of six. Yeah, I live a pretty blessed life as you can all
    imagine. The best part is I’m a stay-at-home dad, [while] mommy works long
    hours.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    proceeded to describe his sexual abuse of one of the children, performing
    cunnilingus on the child until she urinated and then spanking the child for
    urinating on him. He described spanking the child with “good strong smacks and
    my rhythm is steady like a metronome”, then pinning back her legs and using a
    vibrator on her vagina. The appellant said that he used zinc diaper cream to
    digitally penetrate the child’s anus. The appellant indicated that he had
    attached a “couple of teasers” (photographs of the abuse) to his post. He
    stated that he had “already proven myself” to the users of the board. He added
    that he “[w]ould like to hear from other dads of toddler girls, maybe toddler
    boys.” In another posting he told the other members, “if you want private
    trades you will need to prove yourself.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some of the
    appellant’s posting demonstrated contempt for “leechers”, who simply consumed
    the pornography made by “producers” like him and did not contribute their own
    material to the website.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;font-weight:
normal'>The Offender</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    was 35 years old at the time of trial and was unmarried. He had previously been
    in a common law relationship for six years. He had no previous convictions. The
    sentencing judge noted that he had a grade 10 education and had had sporadic
    employment. He had been receiving payments from the Ontario Disability Support Program
    since October 2013 due to a neck and back injury. He admitted to
    self-medicating his anxiety disorders through the regular use of marijuana. He
    also used other non-prescription drugs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    was raised in a dysfunctional home, characterized by violence and substance
    abuse. There was some evidence, referred to in the pre-sentence report, that he
    may have been sexually assaulted by an eleven year old boy from his
    neighbourhood when he was five years old, and other evidence suggesting that he
    had been sexually assaulted by his father at the age of three.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing
    judge noted that the author of the pre-sentence report observed that the
    appellant had made some contradictory statements with respect to the benefit he
    might receive from counselling. He did not feel he had hurt S, because he loved
    her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The author of
    the pre-sentence report noted that although the appellant took responsibility
    for his conduct by acknowledging guilt, he did not appear to be remorseful or
    concerned for the victims. He lacked insight into what a healthy relationship
    with a child should entail.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;font-weight:
normal'>The Victims</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two victim
    impact statements were before the sentencing judge. One was from the children’s
    grandmother, with whom S was placed after the appellant’s arrest and following the
    removal of the children from the family home. The other was from the victims’
    mother. Both statements spoke of the consequences of the abuse, not only on the
    victims, but on their parent, grandparents and siblings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing
    judge observed:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[The
    statements] speak in a poignant and [heart-rending] fashion to the emotional
    trauma suffered by these child victims with its ongoing and lasting effects, as
    well as the physical, emotional and life-altering impact the accused’s conduct
    has wrought upon some of the members of the victims’ families.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim
    impact statements indicated that the older child, S, had required therapy to
    address behavioural and emotional issues and required constant supervision to control
    inappropriate behaviour towards other children, including her younger siblings.
    She had become isolated and alienated. According to her mother, she had developed
    an eating disorder and showed signs of self-mutilation. Her mother was
    concerned that the two younger girls might develop similar behaviours as a
    result of the abuse.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;font-weight:
normal'>Submissions at Sentencing </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown sought
    a sentence of between 15 and 18 years. Crown counsel emphasized the nature of
    the sexual abuse itself, the massive breach of trust and the impact on the
    victims and their family life. He pointed out that quite apart from the
    production and distribution of the child pornography, the sexual abuse of
    defenseless young children on its own would attract a very significant
    penitentiary sentence. The Crown described the images as “clearly sadistic and
    extreme child sexual abuse”, with the appellant’s own words demonstrating his
    desire for recognition and status in the world of child pornography producers.
    Once distributed on the Internet, the Crown pointed out, the pornography could
    never be recalled. The images will continue to be seen by people around the
    world.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence
    acknowledged the gravity of the offences, the vulnerability of the victims and
    the long-term impact of the images remaining on the Internet, particularly with
    respect to S, whose name was attached to some of the images. It was, the
    defence admitted, a unique and aggravated set of facts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence
    submitted that the “range” for the offences was 8 to 15 years. Defence counsel
    acknowledged that it was “one of the most serious offences of making and
    distributing child pornography and, in fact, this person is the perpetrator of
    the sexual violence in the creation of those images. So that makes this a very
    worst example of the offence.” She suggested, however, a sentence of 8 to 10
    years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel
    acknowledged the appellant lacked remorse, and suggested that he was “born
    without an empathy gene.” Counsel said that the appellant simply did not
    understand the harm he had caused the children.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;font-weight:
normal'>Reasons of the Sentencing Judge</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing
    judge described the appellant’s offences as “one of the worst, if not the
    worst, examples” of these offences. The images and films and the appellant’s posts
    on the Internet sites spoke for themselves and demonstrated his determination
    to be recognized and appreciated as a producer of “the most vile of child
    pornography.” He found that the appellant created and distributed the material
    “without concern for the pain and suffering he was inflicting upon his helpless
    and vulnerable victims in his pursuit of recognition and appreciation from his
    like-minded peers.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim
    impact statements, in the judge’s view, spoke “to the emotional trauma suffered
    by these child victims with its ongoing and lasting effects, as well as the
    physical, emotional and life-altering impact the accused’s conduct has wrought
    upon some of the members of the victims’ families.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing
    judge noted:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Even
    in the absence of impact statements the Court is entitled to consider the
    well-known consequences of child sexual abuse upon the victims, including
    psychological harm, emotional trauma, and the inability as an adult for the
    victim to form a loving and caring relationship with another adult. The Court
    can also consider, as in this case, that the posting of the child pornography
    on the internet will forever permit these children, and in particular, S, to be
    further victimized and they will be further traumatized by the knowledge that
    these images and movies could surface in their personal lives at any time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He referred to
    the pre-sentence report but pointed as well to the opinion of the investigating
    officer who described the accused as “arrogant, self-centred and lacking
    remorse”. He noted that the author of the pre-sentence report considered that
    the appellant posed a high risk to re-offend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge noted
    the appellant’s dysfunctional upbringing and the presence of some evidence that
    he had been sexually assaulted as a young child. It was not suggested at
    sentencing or in this court that this evidence should be taken into account as
    an explanation for the appellant’s conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted
    that the goals of denunciation, and general and specific deterrence took
    precedence in these types of offences. He said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
    Courts have made it clear that in sentencing for these types of offences
    denunciation, general and specific deterrence and the need to separate the
    offender from society take precedence over the other recognized objectives of
    sentencing. The Court has a duty to seek to protect children who are our most
    vulnerable and our most valued assets in our society. The sentences imposed
    must be sufficiently punitive to demonstrate society’s revulsion and
    condemnation and to demonstrate to the accused and to those who are like-minded
    that the consequences of such conduct will be dire.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span

    referred to the investigating officer’s opinion that the appellant would be
    likely to re-offend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span

    appellant acknowledges that the sentence for distribution of child pornography
    should be at the high end of the range, he submits that the sentencing judge
    did not give adequate consideration to the totality principle in considering
    the sentences for the other offences and the sentence as a whole, resulting in
    a sentence that was disproportionate and unfit. He characterizes the sexual
    assaults and the making of child pornography as being at the low to medium
    level of severity and the sexual interference as part and parcel of the child
    pornography offences. He submits that the trial judge’s failure to recognize
    that the offences were not the most serious resulted in a total sentence that
    was excessive, particularly when compared to sentences imposed on other
    offenders for similar offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span

    acknowledges that the sentencing judge erred in characterizing lack of remorse
    as aggravating, but submits that the error did not impact the sentence in any
    meaningful way. The respondent describes each of the offences as serious,
    particularly having regard to the very young age of the victims, the distribution
    of images of their abuse on the Internet, the appellant’s stated intention to
    become a “respected” producer of sadistic and degrading child pornography and
    his exhortations of others to do the same. Not only was the appellant producing
    child pornography, he was in possession of other particularly vicious and
    degrading images of sexual abuse of young children. The overall sentence was
    fit.</p>

    well-settled that sentencing decisions attract a high level of deference in

    that deference is required, not simply due to the unique perspective enjoyed by
    the trial judge in hearing and seeing the evidence, and receiving the full
    submissions of counsel for the defence and the Crown, but also because the
    trial judge represents and speaks for the community that has suffered the
    consequences of the crime. The Supreme Court described, at para. 91, the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is
    particular reason for deference in this case. While the appellant pleaded
    guilty, and the judge did not hear evidence as to guilt, he heard evidence on
    sentencing from the investigating officer, a member of the OPP’s Child Sexual
    Exploitation Unit, concerning the search to identify the three child victims,
    the identification of the appellant, and the discovery of the child pornography
    on his computers. The officer testified about the nature and extent of
    distribution of child pornography on the Internet, including the “S series”, the
    location of secret and encrypted websites and user exchange groups and the existence
    of sadistic and degrading websites devoted to made-to-order sexual abuse of
    very young children and babies. The officer also testified about the
    appellant’s involvement in this world of Internet child pornography where he
    aspired to be, and apparently was, a respected producer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing
    judge also saw with his own eyes a selection of photographs and videoclips, explained
    by the investigating officer, to demonstrate the abuse the appellant perpetrated
    on the three victims. This was the child pornography which he himself produced
    and distributed on the Internet. The judge also observed a selection of the
    unrelated sadistic, intrusive and degrading child pornography that was part of
    the appellant’s collection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v.
    Kwok</em>, [2007] O.J. No. 457 (S.C.J.), at para. 48, Molloy J. observed, in reference
    to sadistic child pornography, that “[w]hile the description in words of such
    disturbing images is shocking, nobody can fully appreciate the sickening horror
    of such pornography without actually looking at it.” Having seen and heard this
    evidence, the trial judge had an appreciation of the evidence that this court does
    not have.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the leading
    cases concerning deference in sentencing matters is the Supreme Court’s
    decision in <em>R. v. L.M.</em>, 2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, a case that
    bears some similarity to this. In <em>L.M.</em>, the accused was convicted of sexually
    assaulting his four-year-old daughter and of making, distributing and
    possessing child pornography. His collection of 5,300 pictures and 540 videos of
    child pornography included many images of his sexual abuse of his daughter. He
    distributed the pornography for profit on the Internet. The trial judge imposed
    the maximum ten-year sentence for sexual assault and a consecutive sentence on
    the charges of possessing, making and distributing child pornography, which
    resulted in a global sentence of 15 years. The Québec Court of Appeal reduced
    the global sentence from 15 to 9 years. In restoring the sentence imposed by
    the trial judge, the Supreme Court again emphasized the need for deference in
    appellate review of sentence. LeBel J. observed, at paras. 14-15:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
    its past decisions, this Court has established that appellate courts must show
    great deference in reviewing decisions of trial judges where appeals against
    sentence are concerned. An appellate court may not vary a sentence simply
    because it would have ordered a different one. The court must be “convinced it
    is not fit”, that is, “that ... the sentence [is] clearly unreasonable” (</span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Totality is an
    expression of the principle, stated in s. 718.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the
    responsibility of the offender. As well, s. 718.2(c) provides that where
    consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly
    long or harsh: see also <em>R. v. Ahmed</em>, 2017 ONCA 76, 346 C.C.C. (3d)

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where an accused
    is ordered to serve consecutive sentences for multiple offences, the offences
    are not looked at in isolation. Nor is it simply a mathematical exercise. The cumulative
    sentence must not exceed the overall culpability of the offender: <em>R. v. M.
    (C.A.)</em>, above, at para. 42.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v.
    R.B.</em>, 2014 ONCA 840, 327 O.A.C. 20, this court referred to the proper
    approach in such cases, at para. 8:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Second,
    from reading the sentencing proceedings, we think the sentencing judge followed
    the approach endorsed by this court for sentencing for multiple offences – that
    is, first determine a global sentence and then assign sentences for each
    offence and designate each as concurrent or consecutive to fit within the
    global sentence. Trial counsel framed their submissions in terms of a global
    sentence. The defence argued for two to three years and the Crown for five to
    six years. The sentencing judge appears to have come down the middle.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, as
    in <em>R.B.</em>, the submissions of trial counsel focussed on the total
    sentence. As I have noted, the Crown proposed 15 to 18 years and the defence
    proposed 8 to 10 years. However, at one point defence counsel submitted that
    the sentence should not exceed 14 years (the maximum for sexual assault with a
    weapon). At another point, defence counsel acknowledged that the range for
    making and distributing child pornography was 8 to 15 years, and expressly
    acknowledged that this was one of the worst offences:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>You
    clearly have the worst offence in terms of assessing the offender and the
    offence. This is certainly one of the most serious offences of making and
    distributing child pornography and, in fact, this person is the perpetrator of
    the sexual violence in the creation of those images. So that makes this a very
    worst example of the offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having received
    those submissions, the trial judge specifically adverted to the totality
    principle before determining the appropriate sentence. He said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Each
    of the offences to which the accused has pled guilty provides for maximum and
    minimum sentences. Generally, maximum sentences are reserved for the worst
    offender committing the worst example of the offence. However, even where an
    accused might not qualify as the worst offender the maximum sentence might well
    be appropriate if it is a fit sentence in light of the gravity of the offence
    and the degree of responsibility of the accused. </span><span class=Underline><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>However, where the Court is imposing sentences for
    several offences it must have due regard for the principle of totality of
    sentence to ensure that the sentences to be imposed, taken together, do not
    result in a penalty that is unduly harsh and exceeds that which would be
    appropriate in all of the circumstances</span></span><span style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>.<u> </u>[Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial
    judge did not set out the global sentence before noting the individual
    sentences and whether the sentences were consecutive or concurrent, he stated
    the global sentence immediately thereafter, reflecting the effect of the
    sentences he had imposed. I do not regard this as reflecting a failure to
    consider and apply the totality principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like <em>L.M.</em>,
    this was a complex case in which the determination of the appropriate global
    sentence was the key issue on sentencing. In <em>L.M.</em>, LeBel J. observed,
    at para. 31:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
    judge also correctly understood the close relationship between the offences,
    the overall situation they gave rise to and the need to impose a global
    sentence suited to that situation. Viewed as a whole, the crime was complex.
    The offence of sexual assault was closely connected with three other offences
    of making, possessing and distributing child pornography that are subject to
    express sanctions under the </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Criminal
    Code</span></em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>.
    Each aspect of the offender’s conduct could be considered only in light of all
    these charges, viewed as a whole. As Judge Wilhelmy concluded, the global
    sentence was the crucial factor in determining the sentence in the case at bar.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    appellant’s approach to totality is not consistent with the jurisprudence. He
    would view the sexual abuse inflicted on the victims at the low to mid-range
    described in <em>D. (D.)</em>. He says it was isolated, it did not involve full
    intercourse and it did not include violence or threats of violence. He submits
    the sentence should have taken this into account. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the
    opposite of totality, focusing on isolated features of some of the sexual
    interference offences. It ignores the fact that the appellant committed a
    breach of trust, and that the victims were two infants and a toddler. It
    ignores the sexual assault with a weapon. It ignores the fact that at least
    some of the abuse was committed in the course of making child pornography. It
    ignores the distribution and the perpetuation of the abuse on the Internet. It
    ignores possession of not only the pornography the appellant created, but also of
    the sadistic, degrading and intrusive pornography he obtained from other sources.
    It ignores his activities as a “producer” and his exhortation of others to do
    the same.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    sentencing judge properly applied the totality principle and considered these
    matters and others.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;font-weight:
normal'>Lack of Remorse</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    says that the sentencing judge erred in considering lack of remorse as an
    aggravating factor. The respondent acknowledges that, to the extent the
    sentencing judge did so, it was an error. But the respondent submits that this
    error was inconsequential because it did not impact the sentence and therefore
    does not require this court to open up the sentencing and re-sentence the
    appellant based on first principles. For the reasons that follow, I agree with
    the respondent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To put this
    issue in context, it is important to consider the several sources of evidence
    that were before the sentencing judge concerning the appellant’s appreciation
    of the significance of his acts and their impact on his victims. There was
    evidence of the investigating police officer, the author of a pre-sentence
    report, the appellant’s own statement prior to sentencing and victim impact
    statements from the children’s mother and grandparent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the
    pre-sentence report. The author of the report considered the appellant at high
    risk to re-offend due to his lack of insight and lack of remorse, among other
    things. The trial judge summarized this evidence as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>The
    author of the pre-sentence report indicated that while the appellant admitted
    the offences, he lacked insight into the offences: “he did not feel he hurt the
    children” stating that “he loves the [oldest] child, he would never hurt her.”
    He made no reference to the other two children. At one point in the interview
    the appellant blames his brother and sister-in-law [the children’s parents] for
    being bad parents and permitting the older child to wander around the house
    naked after a bath. The appellant also made contradictory statements about the
    benefits of counselling. The report continues that one of the investigating
    officers described the appellant as arrogant, self-centered and lacking in
    remorse. The officer described the case as “the worst, most sadistic case of
    child exploitation she has been involved in.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a brief
    statement prior to sentencing, the appellant expressed sorrow for the hurt he
    had caused his family. However, nowhere in the appellant’s statement did he
    recognize the physical and emotional trauma that he had inflicted on the
    victims and their family or the lasting implications of the publication of the
    abuse on the Internet.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel
    in sentencing submissions acknowledged that the appellant did not appreciate
    the damage he had done to his child victims – he “doesn’t get the harm he
    caused to them” and it was as if he was born without an “empathy gene”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It appears that
    the sentencing judge’s observations about the appellant’s lack of remorse were
    made in the context of considering the appellant’s lack of insight into his
    crimes and his risk of re-offending. In summarizing the last three of the ten
    aggravating factors he identified, the judge described:</p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>[…]</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>(8) the
    accused’s lack of insight into the harm he has visited upon his victims, either
    due to the lack of any moral compass or through willful disregard;</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>(9) the
    accused’s lack of any genuine remorse; and</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:black'>(10) his ambivalence
    with respect to the possible benefits of counselling, which even in the absence
    of any formal risk assessment certainly raises the spectre of his being at a
    high risk to re-offend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    observations reflect, in part, the views expressed by the author of the
    pre-sentence report:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>In
    this writer’s opinion, the offender’s criminal behaviour combined with his lack
    of remorse for the victims, his thought processes that he can have an intimate
    relationship with a child, moving to a location that could have provided him
    with an opportunity for more victims, his sense of notoriety within the
    pedophilic community, his lack of family supports in the community, and his
    self-centered, arrogant/controlling behaviours </span><span class=Underline><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>make him a high risk to re-offend</span></span><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge also
    stated that while the appellant’s guilty pleas were a mitigating factor, he
    considered them to be “more of an acceptance of reality in the face of
    overwhelming and compelling evidence than an expression of any genuine remorse.”
    However, the judge noted that the appellant’s guilty pleas precluded the
    possibility of the older child testifying, potentially risking further trauma.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The judge was
    entitled to reject the appellant’s profession of sorrow or remorse. While he
    erred in saying that the lack of remorse was aggravating, the context in which
    the statement was made indicates that the primary purpose was to emphasize the
    appellant’s lack of insight into his crimes and the impact on his risk of
    re-offending. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. Shah</em>,

    insight and responsibility for the offence and may therefore be a relevant
    factor in considering the risk of re-offending. The court stated, at paras.

    the present case, the placement of the phrase concerning the appellant’s lack

    considered in their entirety, we do not agree that the trial judge treated the

  <h2><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;font-weight:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    submitted that the sentencing judge erred in imposing consecutive sentences for
    count 3 (possession of child pornography) and count 7 (sexual interference). He
    submits that the sexual interference was part and parcel of the possession of
    child pornography and that the imposition of a six-month consecutive sentence
    for the possession count was unjustified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    also submitted in his factum, relying on <em>R. v. Jewell</em>, that the three-year
    sentence for sexual interference was inappropriate because it was an inherent
    feature of the making of child pornography. He asserted that the effect is that
    he was sentenced twice for the same conduct and the two should have been
    treated as a single transaction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not
    accept either submission. The sentencing judge’s decision to impose a consecutive

    sentencing judge exercises his or her discretion based on his or her first-hand

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The child
    pornography count included child pornography found on the appellant’s computers
    that was in addition to the child pornography he himself produced. In total, his
    collection included some 577 still images and 243 movies. There was also
    evidence that the appellant may have used a software program to erase some of
    the files. The photographs and films recovered included images from what the
    investigating officer described as one of the most offensive and violent series
    of child pornography on the Internet. It included images and films of young
    children being sexually violated, abused and degraded. The investigating
    officer said that she had seen larger collections of child pornography, but in
    six years of working in the area the appellant’s was the most intrusive
    collection she had ever had to categorize. She saw things that she had never
    seen before. The images showed vaginal and anal rape of young children,
    including a child of under two years of age whose arms and legs were bound with
    electrical tape and who was anally penetrated.</p>

    principles in sentencing for child pornography offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is
    confirmed by s. 718.01 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which states that “[w]hen
    a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person
    under the age of 18 years, it shall give primary consideration to the
    objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances of this particular case also bring into play a number of
    statutory aggravating circumstances, including (a) abuse of a person under the
    age of 18 years (s. 718.2(ii.1)); (b) abuse of a position of trust (s.
    718.2(iii)); and abuse which has a significant impact on the victims,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    although the provision was not in effect at the time of the offences, it is
    appropriate to note that the <em>Tougher Penalties for Child Predators Act</em>,
    S.C. 2015, c. 23, increased mandatory minimum and maximum sentences for certain
    sexual offences against children. This included increasing the minimum sentence
    for possession of child pornography to one year and the maximum sentence to 10
    years, where the Crown proceeds by indictment. It also provided that the
    sentences for certain offences against children were required to be served
    consecutively. It added s. 718.3(7), which provides:</p>

    pornography, has become an area of criminality that increasingly menaces our young
    people and threatens our values as a society. Because pornography now can be so

    was easily accessible to child pornographers. Even in <em>D. (D.)</em>, decided
    16 years ago when the Internet was in its relative infancy, this court could
    not foresee that a new category of child sexual abuse was emerging –
    made-to-order sadistic sexual abuse and degradation of young children and
    babies, broadcast into the darkest corners of the Internet, shared with
    communities of abusers and consumers, creating an ongoing cycle in which the
    publisher feeds not only a demand but creates his own supply. A single act of
    abuse is repeated, violating the victim again and again, promoting new abuse of
    new victims.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>This was expressed in eloquent and
    moving words by Ratushny J. in <em>R. v. Lynch-Staunton</em>, 2011 ONSC 218, at
    paras. 49 and 54:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This
    [child sexual abuse] is the source of the extreme harm caused by the possession
    and distribution of child pornography. It starts with innocent children who
    have been physically and emotionally abused by acts of sexual violence
    committed by depraved persons interested in satisfying their own deviant urges
    and in having their actions filmed and shown to others. This starts the cycle
    of abuse and the sexual victimization of these children and of other children
    continues so as to satisfy the “business” of production and distribution of
    child pornography for the curious viewer, the deviant viewer and the depraved
    viewer.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>It
    is the “business” of the possession of child pornography that perpetuates the
    cycle of the physical and mental abuse of children, even though the possessor
    is rarely, and certainly not in the present case in terms of the images, the
    original abuser. As Detective Coakley testified, it is the “new” children being
    portrayed in child pornography images that attract the most demand in terms of
    the “trading card mentality” surrounding collections of child pornography. This
    “value” only means that new and real children are being abused to satisfy the
    demand.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. Nisbet</em>, 2011
    ONCA 26, at para. 1, this court observed that Internet child pornography is
    increasing:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;
background:white'>Sadly, possession of child pornography facilitated through
    the internet is on the rise. It is an abhorrent crime that victimizes the most
    vulnerable members of our society and hence the need for sentences to reflect
    denunciation and deterrence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The fact that Internet child
    pornography is on the rise means that sexual abuse of children for the purpose
    of creating child pornography is almost certainly on the rise.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>As this case demonstrates, the
    detection and prosecution of such crimes is difficult. The offences take place
    in private and are perpetrated against victims who have no voice. Images are
    traded, encrypted, in dark and anonymous corners of the Internet using software
    designed to protect both the supplier and the consumer. Even if police are able
    to access the images, tracing the perpetrators and producers – and, most
    importantly, rescuing the victims – is enormously challenging and depends on
    extraordinarily skillful and patient investigation as well as some degree of
    luck.</p>

    the sentences in a number of cases involving a combination of sexual offences
    and the possession, creation or distribution of child pornography. I will

    I do not propose to distinguish each case from this one, although I will make
    some general comments following this review</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. Cardno</em>, [2013] B.C.J.
    No. 889 (B.C. Prov. Ct.), the accused was convicted of sexual touching, sexual
    touching by a person in a position of trust, sexual assault, sexual exploitation
    and making child pornography. The offences took place over 13 years and were
    committed on prepubescent boys the accused had befriended. There were hundreds
    of incidents and thousands of pictures documenting the abuse. The accused was
    sentenced to a total of 9 years’ imprisonment: 3 years for making child
    pornography and 6 years consecutive for the sexual offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. Pike</em>, 2008 ONCJ
    484, the accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted on 8 counts of sexual
    interference, 1 count of making child pornography and 1 count of possession of
    child pornography. He abused 8 young male victims between the ages of 2 to 14,
    whom he had met through babysitting, coaching and other activities, over the
    course of 4 years. At all times the accused was in a position of trust towards
    the boys. He was found in possession of thousands of images and hundreds of
    movies and stories depicting the sexual abuse of his victims and other children.
    There was evidence of ongoing psychological trauma to the victims. He was sentenced
    to 14 years’ imprisonment, before credit for pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. Gilbert</em>, 2011
    NBPC 10, [2011] N.B.J. No. 76 , the accused pleaded guilty to 11 counts of
    making child pornography, possessing child pornography, sexual assault
    (including unprotected anal sex), sexual interference and sexual exploitation
    committed against 6 male children between the ages of 4 and 16, over an 11-year
    period. The accused abused a position of trust and groomed some of the victims.
    He was sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. D.C.</em>, 2016 MBCA
    49, 336 C.C.C. (3d) 366, the court upheld a 16-year sentence for an offender
    who, over a 3-year period, sexually abused his 9-year-old daughter and 4 sons,
    who ranged in age from 4 to 8 years. He recorded the abuse and posted some of
    it on a website used for sharing child pornography. He pleaded guilty to sexual
    touching, invitation to sexual touching, creating child pornography, possession
    of child pornography and distribution of child pornography. It is noteworthy that
    the sentencing judge would have imposed a sentence of 22.5 years, but for the
    application of the totality principle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. Snook</em>, 2013 NBPC
    17, an accused was sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment after pleading guilty to
    46 offences committed against 17 young male victims (including his foster
    child) over a 12-year period, including making child pornography, making child
    pornography available and possession of child pornography. He was an elected
    municipal official who participated in programs for underprivileged youth.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. K.D.H.</em>, 2012
    ABQB 471, an offender was convicted of sexually abusing 4 child victims,
    including his 2 biological children, over a 9-year period. Their ages ranged
    from approximately 6 to 13 when the abuse began. The abuse included bondage,
    sadism and bestiality.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In <em>R. v. L.M.</em>, the
    Supreme Court of Canada restored the sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment imposed
    by the trial judge on the accused, who had abused 2 child victims, one of whom
    was his daughter, over a period of 2 years when she was between 2 and 4 years
    old. He had distributed images of the abuse, for profit, over the Internet to a
    child pornography network. The accused had a previous record for sexual assaults
    of minors and there were numerous aggravating factors. He pleaded guilty to possession
    and distribution of child pornography and was convicted as well of making child
    pornography and sexual assault. He was assessed at a high rate to re-offend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In this court’s decision in <em>R.
    v. D.G.F.</em>, referred to earlier, the accused pleaded guilty to 7 sexual
    offences, including 2 counts of sexual assault of his 4-year-old daughter, 3 counts
    of making child pornography in relation to his daughter, 1 count of possession
    of child pornography and 1 count of distributing child pornography. He had
    participated in an Internet chat room devoted to the exchange of images and
    films of child sexual abuse. The accused explained that he decided to sexually
    abuse his daughter after receiving encouragement online from other members of
    the chat room. He was apprehended shortly after transmitting a live sexual
    assault of his own daughter to an undercover police officer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>This court set aside an effective 4-year
    sentence as manifestly unfit and imposed a sentence of 7 years, which was the
    sentence the Crown had requested at trial and the basis on which the guilty
    plea had been entered. The Crown on appeal contended that the range for the
    offences was between 7 and 10 years. Feldman J.A. noted, at para. 29, that in <em>L.M.</em> the Supreme Court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed by the trial judge,
    making it “clear that the range can reach well into the double-digit level,
    depending on the number of offences and the confluence of circumstances that
    may exist in each case.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>It seems clear that the sentence
    imposed by this court in <em>D.G.F.</em> was reflective of a plea agreement and
    would undoubtedly have been higher in the absence of that consideration.</p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst><i><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>(c)</span></i><i><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> Conclusion: The
    Sentence was Fit</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The foregoing summary of some of the
    case law does not begin to describe the gravity of the offences or the impact
    on the child victims. Nor does it readily permit comparisons between this case
    and others. The myriad and complex ways in which such crimes are committed makes
    it difficult to compare one case to others and to identify whether one offender
    deserves a greater or lesser sentence than another.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In comparison to some of the cases
    referred to above, this case might be described as an anomaly. The abuse took
    place over a relatively shorter time period than some, there were fewer victims
    than some, and the abuse did not include full intercourse or violence extrinsic
    to the abuse. On the other hand, the circumstances of this case are, to some
    extent <em>sui generis</em> – in a class of their own, so to speak. These
    included: the very young age of the victims; sexual assault with a weapon and
    objects causing evident distress; distribution of the images of the abuse on
    the Internet; the appellant’s boastfulness, his exhortation of others to prove
    themselves with “private trades”; his portrayal of himself as a “producer” and
    a “decent” member of the “community”; and the evidence of the appellant’s child
    pornography collection, with its focus on sadistic and degrading abuse of young
    children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>I return to the issue of
    deference. The Supreme Court’s decision in <em>R. v. Lacasse</em>, above,
    reminds us that deviation from a sentencing range is not, in itself, a basis
    for appellate intervention. The court stated, at para. 11:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>This
    Court has on many occasions noted the importance of giving wide latitude to
    sentencing judges. Since they have, </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>inter
    alia</span></em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>,
    the advantage of having heard and seen the witnesses, sentencing judges are in
    the best position to determine, having regard to the circumstances, a just and
    appropriate sentence that is consistent with the objectives and principles set
    out in the </span><em><span style='font-size:13.0pt'>Criminal Code</span></em><i><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'> </span></i><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>in this regard. The
    fact that a judge deviates from the proper sentencing range does not in itself
    justify appellate intervention. Ultimately, except where a sentencing judge
    makes an error of law or an error in principle that has an impact on the
    sentence, an appellate court may not vary the sentence unless it is
    demonstrably unfit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The court also stated, at para.
    58, that a sentence outside the range may sometimes be appropriate:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>There
    will always be situations that call for a sentence outside a particular range:
    although ensuring parity in sentencing is in itself a desirable objective, the
    fact that each crime is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a
    unique profile cannot be disregarded. The determination of a just and
    appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a
    purely mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are
    difficult to define with precision. This is why it may happen that a sentence
    that, on its face, falls outside a particular range, and that may never have
    been imposed in the past for a similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit. Once
    again, everything depends on the gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree
    of responsibility and the specific circumstances of each case. LeBel J.
    commented as follows on this subject:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>A
    judge can order a sentence outside that range as long as it is in accordance
    with the principles and objectives of sentencing. Thus, a sentence falling
    outside the regular range of appropriate sentences is not necessarily unfit.
    Regard must be had to all the circumstances of the offence and the offender,
    and to the needs of the community in which the offence occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Sadistic sexual assault of twin
    babies and a very young child by a trusted caregiver is amongst the most
    grievous crimes imaginable. To record such abuse and trade it on the Internet compounds
    the injury to the victims. All the more so when the offender does so for the
    stated purpose of attaining notoriety and “respect” so that others will share
    their own sadistic abuse of children. And the more horrific the abuse, the more
    it is valued in that community. The appellant’s violation of his victims is repeated
    every time the images are viewed on the Internet, where they cannot be erased
    and will likely reside in perpetuity. And, as the sentencing judge observed,
    the victims, particularly S whose face is shown, may be further traumatized by
    the knowledge that these images and films could surface in their personal lives
    at any time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>As the sentencing judge noted,
    this is not the only way the victims have been and will be affected. Child
    sexual abuse can cause enduring, even lifelong, psychological harm, trauma and
    suffering. The sexually abused child may become incapable of forming loving and
    caring relationships. His or her family members may suffer the indirect consequences
    of the abuse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Courts must continue to denounce
    and deter such conduct in the strongest possible terms. The only way to do so
    is to send a message to the offender, and to like-minded individuals, that they
    will pay a very heavy price for their conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The sentence in this case sends
    that message. It needed to do so. While the sentence was at the high end of the
    range for such offences, and possibly in excess of the range, I am not
    satisfied that it was the product of an error in principle or of the failure to
    consider or over-emphasis of a relevant factor. Nor is the sentence demonstrably
    unfit.</p>
