  <p class=Judge><strong>Feldman JA.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of child luring under s. 172.1(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. The indictment charged that the appellant believed the complainant
    was under 16 years of age. The complainant was a 15 year old friend of the
    appellants twin daughters. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue on the appeal is whether the trial judge erred in law in
    finding that the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    subjectively believed that the complainant was under 16 years old and therefore
    had the <em>mens rea</em> to commit the offence as charged. Specifically, the
    appellant argues that it was unreasonable for the trial judge to have convicted
    him based on the finding that the accused would have known the complainants
    approximate age, and further, that there was insufficient evidence to support
    a finding that the appellant had the subjective belief that the complainant was
    under 16.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that: the trial judge failed to provide the
    appellant, a self-represent accused, sufficient assistance, and that he erred
    in dismissing the appellants s. 8 <em>Charter</em> application. The appellant
    also seeks leave to appeal his sentence, on the basis that it was unfit because
    the sentence was influenced by a mandatory minimum provision that has since
    been struck down as unconstitutional. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Background facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is the father of twin daughters who were friends of the complainant,
    a girl they went to school with. The complainant turned 16 on October 24, 2013.
    Between August 23, 2013 and October 20, 2013, when she was 15, Facebook
    messages were sent from the appellants Facebook account to the complainants
    account, including: </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on August 28, 2013, a
    picture of a penis was sent, along with the message: Hey, send me your email
    address. I want to send you some pics; </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> on August 30, 2013, a
    different picture of a penis was sent, with the message: I swear by the moon
    and the stars in the sky. I want to suck your pussy n boobs n I want you to
    suck me dickthen me take your virginity.. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on September 26, a
    message was sent that said: u want to suck me dicklolI want to suck your
    pussy and boobs; </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>also on September 26,
    ten minutes later, a third picture of a penis was sent; </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on October 20, a
    fourth picture of a penis was sent, together with the following message: satisfaction
    guaranteedwith life time warranty what us see is what u get take it in your
    mouth and suck it babes. I gon suck your sweet pussy n lovely boobs; and</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>6)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>also on October 20, around
    2 hours later, a picture of a man and a woman in a sexual position was sent
    with the message: u still a virgin.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant, S.K., testified that she met the appellant at the
    mosque when she was 14 and in grade 8. The appellants twin daughters, Aa. H.
    and Ai. H., are one year younger than S.K., born on September 25, 1998. The
    appellant would often pick up the three girls at school, take them out for
    lunch, and drop them back at school. Occasionally, he would take them to the
    mall. The complainant described the appellant as really good friends with her
    uncle. She testified that the appellant knew the complainants father as well;
    they attended the same mosque and, at one time, the two families lived in the
    same building for a period spanning three years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both of the appellants daughters testified. Aa. H. said that she met S.K.
    in grade 9 and they became close friends. She also testified that the appellant
    had initially met S.K. at the mosque. With respect to what the appellant knew
    about S.K.s age, she gave the following testimony: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. Okay. And [S.K.], you said shes a little older than you?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. Yeah.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. Do you know how much older?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. One year.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. Did you tell your dad that she was older than you?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. He knows. He, he was friends with her dad, so they talk.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. Okay. So you believe him to know her age because of her dad
    and him being friends?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. Yeah.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. Did you ever tell him what grade she was in?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. Yeah. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. And what grade were you in when you told him what grade she
    was in?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. Well, when she first came to the school, hes like, Oh,
    really, what grade is she is, and then Im like, She in grade 10, and Im in
    grade 9, so, yeah.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q. And I understand it, in grade 9, you were 14?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A. Yeah.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ai. H. said that S.K. was a year older than she was and a grade ahead of
    her. She confirmed that their fathers knew one another through their mosque and
    that the appellant sometimes took her, her sister, and S.K. all to lunch. She
    also testified that she told her father that she and S.K. were in two classes
    together.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with two offences: sending the messages to a
    person he believed was under 16, i) for the purpose of exposing his genitals
    for a sexual purpose to a person under 16, and ii) for a sexual purpose
    inviting a person under 16 to touch his body. He represented himself, except
    that <em>amicus </em>was appointed to cross-examine both of the appellants
    twin daughters and the complainant, S.K. The appellant did not testify at the
    trial.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Findings by the trial judge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue at the trial involved two aspects of identity. As the first
    count charged the appellant with sending a picture of his penis to the
    complainant, the Crown was required to prove that the penis in the pictures was
    the appellants. In the end, the trial judge was not satisfied of that fact beyond
    a reasonable doubt and entered an acquittal on that count. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second aspect, which related to both counts, was the identity of the sender of
    the Facebook messages. The witnesses testified that the appellant went by a
    nickname reflected in the email address under which the Facebook account that
    sent the messages was registered, but in submissions, the appellant denied it
    was him. The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    had sent the messages based on his finding that the email address associated
    with the Facebook account that sent the messages was the appellants<span

    the other elements of the offence of child luring, the trial judge found that
    the messages constituted an invitation to sexual touching. On the issue of the
    complainants age he stated at para. 219 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In regards to S.K.s age, the
    accused would have known her approximate age. He had met her a few years
    previously at the mosque where both families attended. S.K.s father was a

    was with his daughters.</p>

    leave to appeal allowed, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 290, decision reserved by the Supreme
    Court on May 24, 2018.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'>Issue 1: Is the
    verdict unreasonable because there was no evidence that the appellant believed
    that the complainant was under 16?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    172.1(1)(b) of the <em>Code</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Every person commits an offence who transmits, makes
    available, distributes or sells sexually explicit material to</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(b) a person who is, or who the accused believes
    is, under the age of 16 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission
    of an offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 160(3) or 173(2) or section
    271, 272, 273 or 280 with respect to that person; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wording makes it an offence to communicate sexually explicit material to a
    person who is actually under 16, or to a person whom the accused believes to be
    under 16 years, even if the person is not. This latter form of the offence allows
    the police to communicate with a suspected perpetrator by pretending to be
    under 16 in order to confirm that perpetrator is engaged in child luring. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the complainant was actually under 16 at the time the Facebook
    messages were sent by the appellants device and received by the complainants
    Facebook account.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> However, the appellant was charged with communicating with a person whom he
    believed was under 16, and therefore, the Crown was required to prove that
    subjective belief.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the trial, s. 172.1(3) of the <em>Code</em> provided that where the
    complainant was represented to the accused as being under 16, then in the
    absence of evidence to the contrary, that constituted proof of the accuseds
    belief. That section has since been declared unconstitutional by this court in <em>R.
    v. Morrison</em>. Although Crown counsel at trial mentioned subsection (3), she
    did not rely on it, nor did the trial judge refer to it in his reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons for judgment, the trial judge set out the three essential elements
    of the offence as charged: 1) an intentional communication by computer or
    electronic device; 2) the communication was with a person the accused believed
    to be under 16; and 3) the purpose of the communication was for sexual
    touching. The Crowns submission with respect to proving the second element,
    which the trial judge summarized at para. 175 of his reasons, was that the
    appellant would have known S.K.s age because she was a friend of his daughters
    who was a year older than them. He had met her at the mosque when she was 14
    and the appellants family were friends with S.K.s family.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 176, the trial judge also referred to the Crowns submission with respect
    to s. 172.1(4). That section provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or
    (c) that the accused believed that the person referred to in that paragraph was
    at least 18, 16 or 14 years of age, as the case may be, unless the accused took
    reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel at trial submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant took
    any reasonable steps to ascertain the complainants age. Again, while that
    submission was made, the trial judge did not refer to it or to s. 172.1(4) in
    his findings regarding the appellants belief in the age of the complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the appellant did not raise the defence that he believed the complainant was 16
    or over, there is an issue whether s. 172.1(4) is applicable, and whether the
    Crown may use the failure to make reasonable inquiries to prove an accuseds
    belief that a complainant is under 16. That issue may also be determined by the
    Supreme Court in its decision in <em>R. v. Morrison</em>, currently under
    reserve in that court. As the trial judge did not use the appellants failure
    to make reasonable inquiries as a basis for finding he believed the complainant
    was under 16, there is no need to deal with the issue of the proper
    interpretation and application of s. 172.1(4) in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for unreasonable verdict from <em>R. v. Biniaris</em>, 2000 SCC 15, [2000]
    1 S.C.R. 381, at para. 36, is whether the verdict was one that a properly
    instructed jury, acting judicially could reasonably have rendered. The
    reviewing court is entitled to re-examine and reweigh the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    quoted above, in his reasons, the trial judge found that the appellant would
    have known [S.K.s] approximate age. The appellant submits that by reducing an
    essential element of the offence to an approximation, the trial judge reached
    an unreasonable verdict. I agree that had the trial judge found that the
    appellant believed that S.K. was around the age of 16, that would have been
    an error in law. The appellant had to believe she was under 16. However, it is
    clear from the reasons, read as a whole, that the trial judge found that the
    appellant believed the complaint to be under 16.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges reference to her approximate age must be read in context. By
    correctly reviewing the elements of the offence, the trial judge demonstrated
    that he knew that in order to convict the appellant, the Crown had to prove beyond
    a reasonable doubt that the appellant believed the complainant was under 16
    years of age. While the trial judge found that the appellant did not know the
    complainants exact age  only her approximate age  the Crown was not
    required to prove that the appellant knew the complainants exact age. Read
    contextually, the reasons demonstrate that the trial judge was satisfied that,
    although the appellant did not know the complainants exact age, he believed
    that she was under the age of sixteen years. The trial judges meaning is reinforced
    by the language he used in referring to the <em>mens rea</em><i> </i>component
    in his subsequent reasons on sentence, where he stated at para. 5: The
    Offender was aware that, at the time, the complainant was only 15 years old.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, based on the trial record, in particular the evidence of the
    complainant and of the appellants daughters, the trial judge was entitled to
    find that the appellant believed that the complainant S.K. was under the age of
    16. There was ample evidence to support that conclusion. The appellant was very
    involved with his twin daughters, who were 14 at the time of the offence. He
    had a lot of contact with S.K.s family. He knew them from the mosque, from
    living in the same building for a number of years, and he knew her father and
    was a very good friend of her uncle. He also had a lot of contact with S.K.
    herself by picking her up and taking her for lunch with his daughters. The
    appellants daughter, Aa. H., testified that her father asked her what grade S.K.
    was in when she came to his daughters school, and she told him grade 10. At
    that time, the twins were in grade 9 and they were 14. The appellants other
    daughter, Ai. H., similarly testified that she told her father that she and
    S.K. were in two classes together around this time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    all of this evidence, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the
    appellant would have known S.K.s approximate age, and that he believed she was
    under 16. The verdict is not unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'>Issue 2: Did
    the trial judge err by failing to give the appellant sufficient assistance with
    his <em>Charter </em>issues?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to raise and address a
    breach of s. 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em>, and by failing to give the
    appellant sufficient assistance with his s. 8 motion to exclude the evidence
    seized from his dwelling.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was arrested at the door of his apartment. He told the officers he
    needed to get his shoes, turned around and went back into the apartment. The
    officers followed him in. One accompanied him into his bedroom while the other
    stayed in the kitchen where he observed the open computer and the cell phone.
    He took a photograph of the screen of the computer, which showed an open
    Facebook page, which displayed the appellants email address and read: Your
    account has been deactivated. The officer then seized both items. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the officers and the appellant were seated in the police cruiser, one of the
    officers read the appellant his right to counsel. This was six minutes after
    the initial arrest. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits on appeal that that delay constituted a breach of his s.
    10(b) right, to be informed of his right to counsel without delay, and that the
    trial judge erred by failing to raise and address the issue. The Crown argues
    that there was no air of reality to a s. 10(b) breach based on all the
    evidence, and that the trial judge made no error in failing to address it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to the appellants argument on this ground. A trial
    judges duty to assist a self-represented accused is circumscribed by a
    standard of reasonableness and this duty is not engaged on the mere scent or
    intimation of a possible <em>Charter</em> infringement: <em>R. v. Richards</em>,
    2017 ONCA 424, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 284, at paras. 111 and 113. Therefore, while a
    trial judge has a duty to assist a self-represented accused, including raising
    legal issues that should be addressed, a trial judge is not required to raise
    and knock down issues that do not have an arguable chance of success to benefit
    the accused. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A <em>voir dire</em> was held to address the s. 8 <em>Charter </em>issue where
    facts relevant to the right to counsel issue were also explored in testimony.
    On the <em>voir dire</em>, Constable Durgan testified that when the appellant
    answered the door, the officer advised him that he was under arrest for
    invitation to sexual touching. The appellant turned around and walked back into
    the apartment. Crown counsel asked the officer when he gave the appellant the right
    to counsel and why he waited until they were in the police vehicle. His
    explanation was that he wanted to do it in a safe environment. Because the
    appellant walked back into the apartment, he had to keep control of him and
    ensure everyones safety. Once they were in the police car, he could take out
    his notebook and read the rights to counsel and caution in a safer environment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was entitled to accept this explanation for the short delay in
    reading the appellant his right to counsel. A delay in informing an arrestee
    about the right to counsel is permitted on the basis of concerns for officer or
    public safety: <em>R. v. Suberu</em>, 2009 SCC 33, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 460, at
    paras. 2 and 41, and <em>R. v. Gonzales</em>, 2017 ONCA 543, 385 C.R.R. (2d)
    115, at para. 123; see also as an example, <em>R. v. Dhindsa</em>, 2013 ONCJ 32,
    at para. 51.  Furthermore, the police did not question the appellant during the
    six minute time period and no statements were made. Because of all the
    circumstances, the facts do not raise a <em>prima facie</em> issue under s.
    10(b), and it was reasonable for the trial judge not to consider s. 10(b). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the s. 8 motion, the trial judge explained the issue to the
    appellant, facilitated the holding of the <em>voir dire</em> where all the
    relevant witnesses were called by the Crown, then gave the appellant the
    opportunity to see if he could find duty counsel over lunch to give him any
    assistance he needed with the argument. After the lunch break, the appellant
    reported that he was not able to get much assistance. He first asked for an
    adjournment, then withdrew that request and sought to withdraw the application.
    However, the trial judge directed the Crown to argue the s. 8 issue, the
    appellant made brief submissions that the police should have had a warrant to
    search, and the trial judge gave his ruling on it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argument on the appeal is that the trial judge was obliged to
    provide the appellant with additional assistance to argue his <em>Charter</em> application. He refers to some examples from the Canadian Judicial Councils <em>Statement
    of Principles on Self-Represented Litigants and Accused Persons</em>, published
    September 2016, such as explaining the case law to allow the accused to make
    critical choices, providing information to assist in understanding  rights or
    asserting arguments, and making referrals to agencies for education advice and
    assistance, or questioning witnesses.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    examples of additional assistance are always recommended in the context and
    circumstances of each case and each accused. In this case, the trial judge
    lived up to his obligation. The appellant was articulate and capable before the
    court. The trial judge explained procedures and choices to be made as the trial
    progressed. He held a <em>voir dire</em> to hear the evidence regarding the
    arrest and search. The witnesses were all cross-examined by the appellant. The
    trial judge gave the appellant an opportunity to seek any assistance he wanted
    at the lunch break and was prepared to give an adjournment, although he was
    clearly reluctant to do so at that stage with the trial proceeding hopefully
    within the allotted timeframe.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the legal issues were clear and familiar to the judge. He had to deal with a
    warrantless search of a home upon arrest. He received submissions from both
    sides, then made his ruling. This was not a situation where the unrepresented
    accused did not understand the language or the proceedings. Because he was not
    legally trained, the trial judge assisted him procedurally along the way, gave
    him the opportunity to get assistance, did not acquiesce in the appellants
    request to withdraw his motion, but heard it fully and gave his reasons based
    on the law.  In my view, there is no basis to suggest that the trial judge
    failed to provide sufficient guidance to the appellant, such that he did not
    receive a fair trial as a self-represented accused.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'>Issue 3: Did
    the trial judge err in dismissing the s. 8 <em>Charter</em> application and
    admitting the seized evidence?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral reasons delivered following the argument, the trial judge concluded that
    the Crown had met its burden of proof on a balance of probabilities that the
    seizure was reasonable in the circumstances. He found that once Constable
    Durgun had placed the appellant under arrest, he was in his care and custody.
    As a result, the two officers were required to follow him into the apartment
    and were lawfully there. They were legally entitled to seize the computer and
    the cell phone on three bases: 1) a search incident to arrest and seizure of
    items that appeared to be related to the crimes charged; 2) the items were in
    plain view on the kitchen counter as they walked through the kitchen to the
    bedroom with the appellant; and 3) s. 489(2)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, which</span></em> allows officers to seize without
    a warrant anything they believe on reasonable grounds was used in the
    commission of an offence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits on this appeal that the trial judge erred by finding that the
    officers were lawfully in the dwelling. He argues that each of the
    justifications for the seizures depends on the lawfulness of the officers
    presence in the dwelling. The appellant relies on cases such as <em>R. v.
    Feeney</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13 at para. 43, <em>R. v. Silveira</em>, [1995] 2
    S.C.R. 297, at para. 140, and <em>R. v. Golub</em> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 193
    (Ont. C.A.) for the proposition that the officers breached the appellants
    right to privacy in his home by entering without permission. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in those cases, the police entered the home either before they had made an
    arrest, or in <em>Golub</em>, in order to search following the arrest. In this
    case, the officers arrested the appellant at the door, and only entered his
    apartment when he turned away and entered it following his arrest. First, they
    needed to accompany him in order to maintain control over him for officer
    safety and second, to prevent him from destroying evidence. The police had been
    dispatched to arrest the appellant when the investigating officer, who was
    interviewing the complainant and the appellants daughters, observed the
    appellant at the police station leaving in a hurry. The investigating officer
    was concerned about the destruction of evidence and therefore authorized the
    appellants immediate arrest. In the circumstances that occurred, the officers
    entrance into the apartment was lawful. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers did not proceed to conduct a search without a warrant. They would not
    have been entitled to do so in the circumstances. However, they observed the
    computer partly open and the cell phone in plain view. They were entitled to
    seize items they believed constituted evidence of the offence in accordance
    with s. 489(1)(b) of the <em>Code</em>. Therefore, the trial judge did not err
    in concluding that the appellants right under s. 8 of the <em>Charter </em>was
    not breached.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    there was no <em>Charter</em><i> </i>breach, there is no need to consider s.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge sentenced the appellant to 15 months imprisonment together with
    one year probation. That sentence was imposed before the mandatory minimum of
    12 months imprisonment for the offense of child luring provided by s. 172.1(2)(a)
    was struck down by this court in <em>R. v. Morrison </em>as contrary to s. 12
    of the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons for sentence, the trial judge noted that the appellant continued to
    deny that he had committed the offence and expressed no remorse. He also
    declined to provide the author of the pre-sentence report with the names of any
    people to contact or with authority to contact the Childrens Aid Society,
    which had been involved with the family. The complainant declined to provide a
    victim impact statement. The trial judge accepted that she wished to put the
    ordeal behind her. During her testimony at the trial, she was at times brought
    to tears. The trial judge also stated, referring to this courts decision in <em>R.
    v. Woodward</em>, 2011 ONCA 610, 107 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 58, that child
    luring over the internet has become a pervasive social problem in the
    community.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the sentencing hearing, the Crown submitted that deterrence and denunciation
    were the principal sentencing objectives, and that given the lack of remorse,
    rehabilitation should not be given much consideration. The appellant suggested
    a shorter sentence with probation and community service. He also raised the
    concern of his continuing medical issues arising from a serious car accident in
    1997, which left him unable to work, and the difficulties that would pose for
    him in prison.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the appropriate range for the offence of child luring, the trial judge referred
    again to the case of <em>Woodward</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> as well as the cases of <em>R. v. Jarvis</em> (2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 20 and <em>R.
    v. Dragos</em>, 2012 ONCA 538, 111 O.R. (3d) 481 from this court. In <em>Jarvis</em>,
    which pre-dated the enactment of the mandatory minimum on August 9, 2012, the
    court upheld a 6 month sentence following a guilty plea, but called it lenient,
    and referred to an established range from trial decisions of 12 months to 2
    years. In <em>Woodward</em>, which also pre-dated enactment of the mandatory
    minimum, Moldaver J.A. noted that Parliament had doubled the maximum sentence from
    5 years to 10 years since <em>Jarvis</em>, and suggested at para. 58 that, if
    evidence were properly tendered showing<span lang=EN> that the offence of
    luring has become a pervasive social problem, then</span> a range of 3 to 5
    years could well be warranted in order to deter, denounce and separate from
    society adult predators who commit this serious crime. In both <em>Woodward </em>and <em>Dragos</em>, the complainant was actually lured to a sexual encounter with
    the accused. The trial judge accepted that the range in <em>Jarvis</em> had
    been modified by <em>Woodward</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then noted that the only mitigating factor was that the appellant
    had no criminal record. He specifically rejected the Crowns submission to
    treat the lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. He referred to the
    principles of sentencing, including proportionality. He also accepted that the
    appellants conduct had had a significant impact on the complainant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the trial judge accepted the Crowns submission that a sentence of 15 months
    incarceration followed by 1 year of probation was appropriate. He concluded
    that although 15 months was below the start of the range suggested in <em>Woodward</em>,
    it was not manifestly unjust, given that the luring in this case was not
    successful, was over a relatively short period of time, and took into account
    the mitigating factors of the lack of a criminal record and that the appellant
    did not violate his bail conditions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown on the appeal acknowledges that because the mandatory minimum sentence
    was struck down in <em>Morrison</em> after the sentence was imposed in this
    case, a fit sentence should be determined by this court. However, the Crowns
    submission is that regardless of the former minimum, 15 months is a fit
    sentence for this offender and should be upheld. The appellants position is
    that the mandatory minimum created an inflationary floor that had the effect
    of increasing the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed, and that a
    fit sentence is 6 months imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that because the complainant did not see the messages until
    several months after they were sent and after the appellant had stopped sending
    them, and did not reply, plus the appellant did not attempt to arrange an
    encounter or groom her for a sexual encounter, that a lower sentence is
    warranted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this submission. The fact that the appellants
    approach was direct and unsubtle, and that he gave up when he got no response,
    are not mitigating factors for which the appellant is entitled to any credit. The
    appellant knew the complainant and had direct contact with her in his role as
    the father of her friends. While this may not constitute a direct fiduciary
    relationship, it is akin to one. The complainant was actually under 16. The
    messages that were sent were abhorrent, and if the complainant had been lured
    to respond, could have led to serious sexual offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has repeated many times that where adult sexual predators exploit
    innocent children, deterrence and denunciation and the need to separate the
    perpetrators from society are the predominant objectives of sentencing: <em>Woodward</em>,
    at para.76. In <em>Jarvis</em>, this court commented that 6 months is a lenient
    sentence. In<em> R. v. Gucciardi</em>, 2017 ONCJ 770, a case that was decided
    after <em>Morrison</em>, the accused was sentenced to 12 months incarceration
    in order to give effect to the objectives of deterrence and denunciation, where
    there were a number of mitigating factors not present in this case, including
    the fact that the accused pleaded guilty, expressed remorse, had a supportive
    family, and had taken positive steps toward his rehabilitation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the sentence of 15 months imposed by the trial judge is a fit sentence
    for the appellant in all the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Result</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal against conviction, and grant leave to appeal the
    sentence, but dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
