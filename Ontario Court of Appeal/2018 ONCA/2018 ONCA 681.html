  <p><strong>H.S. LaForme J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ebrahim Toure </span>believed his <span
lang=EN-US>continued detention for immigration removal from Canada was unlawful</span>.
    He commenced an application for release from immigration detention pursuant to
    the <em>Habeas Corpus Act</em>, <span lang=EN-US>R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 1</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span>and ss. 7, 9, 10(c), 12 and 24(1) of the <em>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. His <em>habeas corpus </em>application <span
lang=EN-US>was dismissed. Relief was, however, granted under s. 24(1) for a
    violation of his s. 12 </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US> rights. The
    application judge found that Mr. Toure’s detention in a maximum security jail
    was cruel and unusual and ordered his transfer to an immigration detention
    centre. Accordingly, Mr. Toure was removed from the maximum security provincial
    facility at </span>Central East Correctional Centre <span lang=EN-US>(“CECC”)
    to the Toronto Immigration Holding Centre (“IHC”), pending future detention
    reviews and removal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Toure appeals the application judge’s order
    dismissing his </span><em>habeas corpus</em> <span lang=EN-US>application. At
    the same time, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the
    Attorney General of Canada (the “Minister”) seek leave to appeal the application
    judge’s order granting Mr. Toure s. 24(1) relief for violating his s. 12 </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN-US> rights. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the following reasons, I conclude that Mr.
    Toure’s appeal should be dismissed and the Minister’s cross-appeal should be
    allowed.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BRIEF BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In June 2012, Mr. Toure, who claimed to be
    Guinean, had his immigration claim denied by the Immigration and Refugee Board
    under the </span><em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (“<i><a
href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2001-c-27/latest/sc-2001-c-27.html"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>IRPA</span></a></i>”). His
    application for judicial review was refused and he was placed on a conditional
    departure order with terms and conditions pending his removal from Canada. He
    failed to report for a required interview with the Canadian Border Security
    Agency (“CBSA”) resulting in his arrest and his detention at the IHC in February
    2013. Following a detention review in February 2013, he was found to be a
    flight risk and his continued detention was ordered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Attempts were made by the CBSA to remove Mr.
    Toure to Guinea, however, Guinean authorities found that his Guinean birth
    certificate was fraudulent and refused him entry. He told Guinean authorities
    that he was not Guinean but had status in The Gambia through his father.
    Further, he was unable to speak or understand French, the official language of
    Guinea. On his return to Canada he continued to proclaim that his citizenship
    was Guinean.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since his return to Canada in April 2013, and
    until the order under appeal, Mr. Toure had been detained in the CECC rather
    than the IHC. The CBSA claims he does not meet the criteria for detention in a
    lower risk facility; the only one in Ontario being the IHC. At the time of his
    appeal he has had more than 56 detention reviews; all have concluded that his
    continued detention is required because he poses a flight risk, specifically
    that he would not appear for removal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the appeal, Mr. Toure submits that the
    application judge erred in three respects: (1) he improperly applied the legal test
    at the jurisdictional stage; (2) he found there was a reasonable prospect of
    removal within a reasonable time; and (3) he sanctioned indefinite detention.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the cross-appeal, the Minister submits the
    application judge committed the following errors: (1) he failed to properly
    identify and apply the legal test to decide whether Mr. Toure’s detention
    constituted a breach of s. 12 of the </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US>;
    and (2) in factually concluding that the duration and conditions of Mr. Toure’s
    detention constituted a breach of s. 12. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Jurisdiction and Mootness</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before proceeding to discuss the main issues
    just identified, I will briefly dispose of two peripheral matters. First, this
    court was satisfied that these appeals were properly before us, rather than the
    Divisional Court as provided for in s. 8(1) of the </span><em>Habeas Corpus Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>. We agreed with the positions of the parties, namely: (i) the
    cross-appeal concerned the s. 24(1) </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US> remedy that was granted to Mr. Toure for a breach of his s. 12 </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN-US> rights; and (ii) Mr. Toure sought relief under ss. 10(c) and 24(1)
    of the </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US>, in addition to </span><em>habeas
    corpus</em><span lang=EN-US>. Accordingly, s. 6(2) of the </span><em>Courts of
    Justice Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 provides this court the
    requisite jurisdiction to hear the appeals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, Mr. Toure argues that the cross-appeal
    is moot as he is currently detained at the IHC rather than the CECC pursuant to
    the order under cross-appeal, and neither the Minister nor the Intervener seek
    an order that he be transferred out of the IHC. He submits that any decision on
    the cross-appeal will not resolve a live controversy affecting the rights of
    the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not agree that the cross-appeal is clearly
    moot. And in any event, having regard to the factors identified in </span><em>Borowski
    v. Canada (A.G.)</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, we conclude that
    it is appropriate to decide the matter. The interests of judicial economy would
    be better served by rendering a decision on the cross-appeal, the adversarial
    context remains and the cross-appeal was fully argued by all sides, and
    rendering a decision in these circumstances is consistent with the role of the
    judiciary.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>I.        THE APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issue 1: </span><span
lang=EN-US>Did the application judge err in applying the required test at the
    jurisdictional stage?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Habeas corpus</em><span lang=EN-US> applications proceed in
    two stages. First, the applicant must show that he or she has been deprived of
    liberty and that there is a legitimate ground upon which to question the
    legality of the detention. If the applicant succeeds in meeting that threshold,
    the onus shifts to the authorities to show that the deprivation of liberty is
    lawful: see </span><em>Mission Institution v. Khela, </em>2014 SCC 24, <span
lang=EN-US>[2014] 1 S.C.R. 502, at para. 30</span>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In Mr. Toure’s case, the issue for the
    application judge was whether Mr. Toure’s </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span
lang=EN-US> application was directed solely at his detention pending
    disposition of his immigration issues. A detention that is longer than is
    reasonably necessary to further the machinery of immigration control cannot be
    justified and continued detention will violate the detainee’s ss. 7 and 9 </span><em>Charter </em><span lang=EN-US>rights; </span><span lang=EN-US>his continued detention
    would be unlawful: </span><em>Chaudhary v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency
    Preparedness)</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2015 ONCA 700, 127 O.R. (3d) 401, at para.
    81</span><span lang=EN-US>. The two-stage process then proceeds in the following
    fashion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>First, in order that his </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span
lang=EN-US> application could be heard on the merits, Mr. Toure had the onus to
    show that reasonable and probable grounds existed for his complaint.
    Specifically, as his application alleged, his detention is unlawful because:
    (i) it has been exceptionally lengthy; and, (ii) his continued </span>detention
    is of uncertain duration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, if Mr. Toure established his complaint,
    the Minister was required to satisfy the court that, despite its length and
    uncertain duration, the continued detention of Mr. Toure was still justified
    because it is reasonably necessary to further the machinery of immigration
    control: </span><em>Chaudhary, </em><span lang=EN-US>at para. 81. </span>Thus,
    if there was no reasonable prospect that the detention’s immigration related
    purposes would be achieved within a reasonable time, Mr. Toure’s continued
    detention would violate his <em>Charter</em> rights. What is a reasonable
    prospect of his removal within a reasonable time will depend on the
    circumstances.  </p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-US>     The
    First Stage Conclusion</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge referenced the test
    described by this court in </span><em>Chaudhary </em><span lang=EN-US>to
    determine at the first stage whether he should assume </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span
lang=EN-US> jurisdiction. He first found that Mr. Toure’s detention from the
    time he admitted he was Gambian — calculated at 21 months — was unduly lengthy.
    However, in his reasons under the heading “uncertain duration”, at para. 41, he
    described the issue as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the respondent that the applicant
    does not satisfy the uncertain duration criteria simply by asserting that no
    scheduled date for removal has been set. The issue is whether removal will
    occur within a reasonable time. What will be considered reasonable will depend
    on the circumstances, which includes the applicant’s emerging cooperation with
    the removal process, the direct participation of the country to which he will
    be removed and satisfying its requirements to obtain the necessary travel
    documents.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-US>He went on to state at para. 44:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It cannot be said that there is no reasonable
    prospect that some development is likely to occur that will provide the
    necessary documentation to permit the applicant to be removed, rendering his
    detention indeterminate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>And at para. 45 he concluded: “the applicant has
    not satisfied the criteria that his detention, although lengthy, is of
    uncertain duration.” In other words, he found that Mr. Toure had failed to
    raise a legitimate ground upon which to question the legality of his detention;
    there was no foundation to assume jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Submissions</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Toure submits the application judge erred at
    this first stage in two respects. First, he contends the application judge
    erroneously asked whether Mr. Toure’s removal would occur in a reasonable time.
    He argues that the only question at this stage was whether the future length of
    detention was uncertain. The approach taken, he says, had the effect of
    shifting the onus on to Mr. Toure. It is the Minister, he says, once
    jurisdiction has been established, that must demonstrate that the detention is

    the application judge took an unnecessarily narrow view of his jurisdiction. He

    at para. 41, this court rejected the contention that </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span

    explain that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Chaudhary </em><span lang=EN-US>rests on the general

    of the Federal Court is less advantageous than </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span

    raised by nor addressed by Mr. Toure, or consequently by the application judge,

    of Mr. Toure’s onus at the jurisdiction stage as including, “whether<span

    shifting the Minister’s onus on to him. In my view, it did not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Chaudhary</em><span lang=EN-US> does not set a maximum length
    of detention; instead, it prescribes a fact-driven analysis in which there is a
    balancing of the statutory reasons for detention and the prospect of removal
    within a reasonably foreseeable timeframe against a detainee’s rights not to be
    detained arbitrarily or for indefinite periods: </span><em>Brown</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 31. Further, this court noted in </span><em>Brown</em><span
lang=EN-US> at para. 32:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>While the length of the detention is a
    critical factor in that analysis, the question of when it can be reasonably
    anticipated that the removal order will be executed is another important
    consideration. In that sense, it is principally a forward-looking test and not
    one where reasonable decisions are later made to appear as having been
    unreasonable with the benefit of hindsight.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    assistance. These cases are distinguishable on their facts. Further, they make
    clear that in assessing uncertain duration a reviewing body is to have regard
    to the actual facts of the case. In this case, the lack of certainty about the

    than Mr. Toure’s cooperation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is important to note that Mr. Toure is not being
    detained because of his failure to cooperate, as he claims. His detention is in
    fact because of concerns, based on his past conduct, of him failing to appear
    for proceedings involving his immigration issues when required to do so. His
    non-cooperation is but one factor - a significant one to be sure - in the
    CBSA’s ongoing efforts to remove him from Canada.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Toure also complains that the application
    judge did not fairly consider his mental health, that he has no criminal
    charges, and that he is not a danger to the public. He argues that more
    importance was unfairly placed on his varying cooperation with the CBSA. The
    application judge did not err in his consideration of these issues given that he
    was deciding whether Mr. Toure’s detention was of uncertain duration. Mr.

    that would permit Mr. Toure to be removed. It seems clear that Mr. Toure’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the fact that the application judge noted
    that Mr. Toure had not pursued juridical review or an adjournment regarding the
    Immigration Division’s refusal to grant further disclosure had nothing to do
    with his conclusion on disclosure, such as it was. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, Mr. Toure did not make a motion before
    the application judge for disclosure in his </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span
lang=EN-US> application. He had brought a previous unsuccessful motion before a
    different judge, which he did not appeal. Although Mr. Toure’s counsel did
    reference disclosure in his submissions on his </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span
lang=EN-US> application; he did not bring a second motion. Instead, at the
    conclusion of the oral evidence, Mr. Toure’s counsel handed the application
    judge a list of documents he felt should be disclosed. When asked whether he
    intended to pursue a motion with respect to these documents, counsel stated
    that he would only do so “in the event the court concluded that [the Minister]
    may have met their burden” in proving the legality of detention.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On this record, the disclosure issue is far from
    being an example of severe unfairness and a breach of fundamental justice, as
    Mr. Toure submits. There is no merit whatsoever in this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Issue 3 - Did the application judge sanction
    indefinite detention?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Toure submits that the justification
    underpinning the application judge’s decision is that “a detainee’s lack of
    active cooperation with removal proceedings will justify indefinite detention.”
    He says that Mr. Toure’s detention, according to the application judge: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>…has been and will continue to be lawful for
    however long that he does not cooperate with removal efforts. In other words,
    indefinite detention is a just punishment for non-cooperation with deportation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This interpretation of the application judge’s
    conclusion is a flawed reading of his reasons, in my view. When his reasons are
    read as a whole and fairly considered, they do not endorse indefinite detention
    in the immigration context based on non-cooperation alone. To the contrary,
    they clearly reveal that the application judge properly considered Mr. Toure’s
    lack of cooperation only as an important factor in his ongoing detention. As
    the Minister notes, it is a well-established principle that unexplained delay
    or lack of diligence should count against the offending party: see </span><em>Ali
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2017 ONSC 2660, 137 O.R.
    (3d) 498, at para. 22. This does not convert the lack of cooperation into the
    reason for detention. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Non-cooperation is clearly a factor that may
    contribute to the length of someone’s detention. In Mr. Toure’s case, the
    application judge, while noting that his failure to cooperate in the past with
    the CBSA is a significant factor, also considered all the other facts of the
    case. This included a summary of the CBSA efforts to identify Mr. Toure, the
    failed attempt to remove him to Guinea, and his reason for continued detention,
    namely, he was found to be a flight risk.</span></p>

    to international norms against indefinite detention. This submission is
    contrary to the jurisprudence and has not persuaded me that Mr. Toure’s
    detention runs afoul of Canada’s international commitments. Canada’s
    immigration detention system operates differently from the regimes in other
    nations, but it remains constitutionally compliant primarily because it
    provides an effective review process that meets the requirements of Canadian
    law: </span><em>Brown</em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 37-38. Importantly, the

    and unusual punishment and was contrary to s. 12 of the </span><em>Charter</em><span

    hearing. His counsel submitted that no personal evidence was required for Mr.
    Toure to meet his low evidentiary burden on the </span><em>habeas corpus </em><span
lang=EN-US>application. It appears that this approach was not adjusted to take
    into account the more difficult task faced by Mr. Toure in seeking relief under
    s. 24(1) of the </span><em>Charter </em><span lang=EN-US>for an infringement of
    s. 12. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>reasonable or probable ground exists for their complaint: see </span><em>Chaudhary</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 81.</span><span lang=EN-US> In other words, an applicant
    need only lead enough evidence to show “there is a cause to doubt the legality

    Immigration)</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2007 SCC 9, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350, which held
    that the immigration detention review scheme in the </span><em>IRPA</em><span
lang=EN-US> and its regulations does not violate s. 12. This is because, as </span><em>Charkaoui</em><span
lang=EN-US> states at para. 123, “[</span><em>IRPA</em><span lang=EN-US>]
    permits robust ongoing judicial review of the continued need for and justice of
    the detainee's detention pending deportation”. However, </span><em>Charkaoui</em><span
lang=EN-US> also cautions that there is the possibility that “at a certain
    point … a particular detention constitutes cruel and unusual treatment … and
    therefore infringes the </span><em>Charter”</em><span lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge referred to the Supreme
    Court’s decision in </span><em>Regina v. Smith</em><span lang=EN-US>, </span><span
class=reflex3-alt>[1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045</span><span lang=EN-US> for the
    framework for determining whether a detention constitutes cruel and unusual
    punishment. In particular, he relied on </span><em>Smith</em><span lang=EN-US> at p. 1072 where Lamer J. described cruel and unusual punishment in the
    sentencing context as being “grossly disproportionate” to appropriate
    punishment and so excessively lengthy “as to outrage standards of decency” (the
    majority of the court agreed on this point). The application judge added to
    this that gross disproportionality is made out where the length of imprisonment
    is abhorrent or intolerable to society. This is consistent with </span><em>R.
    v. Morrissey</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2000 SCC 39, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, at para.
    26, wherein Gonthier J., writing for the majority, equated grossly
    disproportionate punishment with punishment “that Canadians would find …
    abhorrent or intolerable”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Minister and the Intervener argue that the
    application judge did not follow the framework endorsed in </span><em>Ogiamien
    #1</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 10: (1) determine what treatment would have
    been appropriate, and (2) measure the actual treatment against this benchmark.
    While the application judge did not refer to or rely on this case in reaching
    his decision, I do not accept that his approach in his analysis amounts to an
    error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As it was in </span><em>Ogiamien #1</em><span
lang=EN-US>, Mr. Toure’s case is about treatment and not punishment. In either
    case however, the test to establish a violation of s. 12 is the same. The words
    “cruel” and “unusual” colour each other and together express a standard or
    norm. That is, Mr. Toure is not required to establish each separately, and
    “cruel and unusual” is a high bar to meet: </span><em>Ogiamien #1</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 7-9.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Ogiamien #1</em><span lang=EN-US>, in my view,<em> </em>did
    not set out the specifically referenced two-step process as the only possible
    manner of assessing s. 12 claims. Indeed, the framework followed in </span><em>Ogiamien
    #1 </em><span lang=EN-US>was a recognition of the approach revealed in a
    statement in </span><em>Smith</em><span lang=EN-US>, at p. 1072. That is, cruel
    and unusual punishment is “grossly disproportionate to what would have been
    appropriate”. I am satisfied that the application judge specifically followed </span><em>Smith</em><span
lang=EN-US> and the two-step approach implied by this statement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not believe that </span><em>Ogiamien #1 </em><span
lang=EN-US>should be read as finding the approach taken by the application
    judge improper or inconsistent with asking whether ‘the treatment is grossly
    disproportionate to the treatment that can be justified and is so excessive as
    to outrage standards of decency’.  </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The findings and determination of the application
    judge on s. 12</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As expressed in </span><em>Ogiamien #1</em><span
lang=EN-US> at para. 54, a determination of whether treatment is cruel and
    unusual requires a focus on the effect of the conduct in question — does it
    give rise to cruel and unusual treatment?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In essence, the application judge accepted Mr.
    Toure’s general assertion that his treatment of being detained in the CECC
    rather than in a facility dedicated to immigration detention amounted to cruel
    and unusual treatment. More specifically, he accepted that given Mr. Toure’s flight
    risk concerns, the CBSA criteria for a lower security placement, and Mr.
    Toure’s personal circumstances, his detention in “a maximum security facility
    in which prisoners are maintained on remand or to serve provincial reformatory
    periods of incarceration of less than two years”, as opposed to the IHC, is “so
    excessive to be considered abhorrent and intolerable to our society”: paras. 75
    and 88. He made several findings to support this conclusion, which I will
    briefly describe below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the application judge addressed the
    process of detaining an immigration detainee. He noted that the CBSA decides
    whether to direct the detainee to a provincial maximum security facility or a
    location with a lesser degree of security. He seems to accept Mr. Toure’s submission
    that this process falls short of providing any legal basis for making such a
    decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the application judge noted that in Mr.
    Toure’s case there has been an ongoing process of review that has considered
    the issue of detention as </span><em>Charkaoui</em> <span lang=EN-US>requires.
    However, he also found that the place of his detention has not been considered
    on the reviews; “[he] has also no means to challenge his placement in the much
    harsher conditions of provincial jail”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the application judge noted that Mr. Toure
    has been detained for more than four years at the CECC. He then referred to a
    psychiatric assessment of Mr. Toure conducted on August 14, 2017, which
    revealed that he displayed symptoms of a dissociative state having intruding
    auditory and visual hallucinations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, he noted that Mr. Toure is considered a
    flight risk by the Immigration Division, but that no assessment has been
    undertaken as to whether his imprisonment is the most minimally impairing and
    proportionate disposition to deal with his risk. According to the criteria set
    out in the CBSA National Risk Assessment for Detention Guide, he more qualifies
    for placement in a less secure environment than a provincial detention centre.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, he concluded at para. 87 that while at
    the CECC Mr. Toure spent almost one and a half years in lockdown. “Mr. Toure
    has spent more time in a maximum security facility than someone convicted of a
    serious crime of violence”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, the application judge held,
    at para. 88, that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The duration and conditions in which Mr. Toure
    has been kept has made his detention both cruel and unusual. The condition and
    duration of his detention is “so excessive to be considered abhorrent and
    intolerable to our society”. The applicant’s s. 12 rights have been breached as
    a result.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge ordered that Mr. Toure be
    removed forthwith from the maximum security provincial facility to the IHC,
    pending future detention reviews and removal. The order does not preclude
    alternate forms of community-based control where considered appropriate and
    necessary to minimize flight risk pending removal.</span></p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Did Mr. Toure Meet the High Threshold to
    Establish a s. 12 </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US> Breach?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the outset, it is long established that </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN-US> applications should not be made in a factual vacuum. As has been
    repeatedly noted in these reasons, it is Mr. Toure’s onus to put forward a
    rigorous record to overcome the high threshold required to demonstrate a breach
    of s. 12 of the </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US>. In my view, the
    evidence in this case falls far short of concluding that Mr. Toure has met this
    high bar of showing his treatment was cruel and unusual. The errors made by the
    application judge are largely linked to the lack of evidentiary foundation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the application judge erred in finding
    that there is no legal basis for the process by which the CBSA makes decisions
    regarding an immigration detainee’s placement of detention. The general
    immigration detention policies and procedures were not the subject of the
    underlying application. As the application judge noted, </span><em>Charkaoui </em><span
lang=EN-US>found the review scheme in the </span><em>IRPA</em><span lang=EN-US> and its regulations consistent with s. 12 of the </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN-US> because it provides for meaningful ongoing review taking into
    account the context and circumstances of an individual case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Toure had a mechanism to challenge his place
    of detention and to raise the conditions of the CECC with the CBSA. The
    jurisprudence supports this as did the Minister’s evidence on the application.
    The application judge failed to properly consider this evidence, including that
    Mr. Toure had not asked the CBSA to transfer locations: see </span><em>Brown</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 38. The location of detention is a proper issue for
    immigration detainees to raise with the CBSA. Particularly, if the location of
    their detention is not consistent with how they fit within the CBSA’s own
    criteria. If this query is ignored, this decision is the proper subject of
    judicial review.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence supports the decision to place Mr.
    Toure at the CECC, which was a discretionary decision reviewable by the Federal
    Court. While Mr. Toure met several criteria for placement in a lower security
    detention centre, he also met several criteria for placement in a more secure,
    maximum facility. Mr. Toure provided no evidence to the contrary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, there is no evidence beyond the August
    14, 2017 psychiatric assessment and nothing from Mr. Toure as to how it impacts
    on him or how it assists in establishing his claimed s. 12 </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN-US> breach. Notably, the only time Mr. Toure has relied on the
    psychiatric assessment referenced by the application judge was at the hearing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, while I accept that the application
    judge miscalculated the time Mr. Toure spent in lockdown, I do not necessarily
    agree that this was a palpable and overriding error. However, the application
    judge did err in two material ways regarding the evidence of lockdowns: (i) he
    did not explain how the lockdowns, or any conditions, departed from the
    ordinary conditions of detention in a manner that was grossly disproportionate;
    and (ii) he failed to examine the actual effect of lockdowns on Mr. Toure: see </span><em>Ogiamien
    #1</em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 10, 54, 62, 68.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The only evidence about the conditions of his detention at the CECC
    was the lockdown information. Mr. Toure provided virtually no evidence of how
    those conditions specifically affected him. There was no evidence whatsoever
    about: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>1.</span><span
lang=EN-US>       the particulars of the CECC’s size, categories of inmates, or
    placement options, for example high risk, low risk, or those on remand; and,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>2.</span><span
lang=EN-US>       the CECC’s daily living conditions such as the number of
    inmates in a holding cell, recreation options or socialization.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge’s failure to determine how
    the lockdowns or conditions at the CECC rose to a level that was abhorrent or
    intolerable or so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency are fatal
    errors in Mr. Toure’s case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before concluding, I would make a final comment
    about the problems inherent in hearing </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US> claims together with </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span lang=EN-US> applications. As this court observed in </span><em>Brown</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    at para. 20:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Because of the importance of the interests at stake, </span><em>habeas</em> <em>corpus</em><span lang=EN-US> is intended to be a
    manner of quickly resolving the issue of the lawfulness of a person’s
    deprivation of liberty: </span><em>May v. Ferndale Institution</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2005 SCC 82, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 809, at para. 69. Courts are to give
    priority to such applications as they are deemed to be urgent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Habeas corpus </em><span lang=EN-US>applications are intended
    to be quick and impose a low threshold on the applicant. The onus largely falls
    on the authorities to justify the legality of the detention at issue. This
    stands in stark contrast to </span><em>Charter </em><span lang=EN-US>s. 12</span><em><span
lang=EN-US> </span></em><span lang=EN-US>applications in which the applicant
    must create an evidentiary foundation sufficient to meet the high bar required
    by such proceedings. The difference in thresholds to be met by the applicant
    makes it difficult to hear both </span><em>habeas corpus </em><span lang=EN-US>and </span><em>Charter </em><span lang=EN-US>claims together in an expeditious
    manner while also providing the necessary evidentiary foundation.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In Mr. Toure’s case, the application judge’s
    decision is internally inconsistent in that he found the detention to be lawful
    and that it ought to continue. However, he then relied on the duration of the
    detention to find a s. 12 </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN-US> breach. The
    urgency of the </span><em>habeas corpus</em><span lang=EN-US> application was
    impacted by such an approach as was the approach to meeting the high bar
    imposed by s. 12.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For all the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss
    the appeal and grant the cross-appeal.</span></p>
