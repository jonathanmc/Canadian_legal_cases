lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals from both conviction and
    sentence on charges of possession of child pornography. He submits that the
    trial judge erred by failing to exclude the evidence of child pornography found
    on a computer used by him, on the ground that the search of the device was
    unreasonably invasive, and therefore amounted to an unreasonable search
    contrary to s. 8 of the <em>Canadian </em></span><em><span lang=EN-US

    mandatory minimum sentence for possession of child pornography in force at the
    time of his offences</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

lang=EN-US>, and that in any event the ten-month sentence of imprisonment (less

    unfit with or without the mandatory minimum.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In April 2014, Detective Constable Spence of the
    Halton Regional Police Internet Child Exploitation Unit learned that an
    Internet Protocol (“IP”) address in Halton was associated with 174 files
    believed to contain child pornography. Spence determined from the hash values
    of the 174 files that 7 of the files were videos containing child pornography. A
    hash value is a unique identification number assigned to a file that functions
    like a fingerprint for a file. Police maintain a database of the hash values of
    known child pornography. The other 167 files had names typically associated
    with child pornography.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Spence asked the internet service provider for
    the name and address of the subscriber assigned to the IP address. He learned
    that the subscriber was the appellant’s father and that the municipal address was
    for a residence in Oakville. The appellant lived in this home as well as his
    sister. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Spence applied for a warrant to search the
    residence and any computer system found in the home. He indicated in the
    Information to Obtain a Search Warrant that police would try to minimize the
    scope of the computer search. Specifically, with respect to the scope of the
    proposed search, he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The computer forensic examination will be
    conducted by the qualified technicians of the Halton Police Technological Crimes
    Unit. The examination involves the creation of a complete mirror image of the
    data stored on the devices. I know from my training and experience that this
    type of examination can take several weeks to complete.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Attempts will be made to focus and minimize
    the scope of the forensic examination for the above described data. However,
    for several reasons, a thorough examination of the entire data contained in the
    items will need to be undertaken to locate the sought data.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Firstly, computer searches need to be
    relatively broad in order to cope with the practical realities of an
    ever-changing and developing age of technology. Analysts must be able to adapt
    their investigation to the systems they discover. New or unanticipated
    techniques may be required to respond to new technological challenges.
    Ultimately, it is not feasible to envisage every type of data that would fall
    under the specified categories.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[Secondly], computer files can be disguised in
    any number of ingenious ways, the simplest of which is to give files a misleading
    name (pesto.recipe in lieu of blackmail.photos) or a false extension (.doc in
    lieu of .jpg or .gz); therefore, files names alone are not necessarily
    indicative of their content. Accordingly, an expansive search of the entire
    data content of the items will need to be undertaken to locate the relevant
    data.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It is intended that the forensic analysis will
    include:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Police executed the warrant the next day. They
    found a computer in the appellant’s bedroom. Detective Constable Mazzuto, an
    officer with technical expertise, conducted an on-site preview of that
    computer. He found files with titles associated with child pornography, but he
    did not view any actual pictures or videos of child pornography during the
    course of his preliminary review. Mazzuto also found evidence of a peer-to-peer
    file sharing program, although it had been deleted. The police seized the
    computer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Several months later, police conducted a more extensive
    examination of the seized computer. Mazzuto began the process by copying all of
    the data on the computer’s hard drive. He then conducted a “pre-categorization”
    of all the images and videos that were on the hard drive and identified files
    bearing the hash values of known child pornography. He provided the results of
    this “pre-categorization” to Spence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Spence examined the pre-categorized files and
    determined that there were 50 unique images of child pornography on the appellant’s
    computer.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes no objection to this step,
    but says the next steps taken by the officer went too far. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, Spence systematically examined every
    image and video located on the hard drive. He ultimately found 89 unique videos
    containing child pornography. Forty-nine of these videos were found in the
    incomplete download folder of the peer-to-peer file sharing program the
    appellant was using. Spence testified that he could not have narrowed his
    search by searching by hash values alone, because if even one pixel in an image
    had been changed, the hash value would be different. According to his sworn
    statement in the ITO, he could not have relied on file names because a title
    given to a file by a user might not be reflective of the content of the file.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, Spence reviewed the computer’s internet
    search history. It demonstrated that the user was searching for child
    pornography. The fact that the appellant’s email account was accessed relatively
    close in time to when files with names suggestive of child pornography were opened
    suggested that the appellant was the person searching for and viewing the child
    pornography. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the course of his review of each image and
    video on the computer, as well as the computer’s internet search history,
    Spence learned of information about the appellant that was unrelated to child
    pornography, such as his interest in computer games and in Star Trek. However, Spence
    did not look at documents or other personal information unconnected to his
    search for images and videos of child pornography and his attempts to identify
    the person responsible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Spence ultimately determined that there were 50
    unique images and 89 unique videos amounting to child pornography stored on the
    appellant’s computer. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Trial Judge’s Decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, the Crown acknowledged that the
    warrantless request for subscriber information was a <em>Charter</em> breach.
    The request for that information was made six weeks before the Supreme Court of
    Canada released its decision in <em>R. v. Spencer</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2014 SCC 43, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 212,</span></em> holding that there is a reasonable expectation of privacy in this information. In
    these circumstances, the trial judge found this breach to be less serious and determined
    that it did not require the exclusion of evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    argument that the manner in which police searched his computer was
    unreasonable. She adopted the test described by Cromwell J. in <em>R. v. Vu</em>,
    2013 SCC 60, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 657, at para. 22, that a reasonable search is “no
    more intrusive than is reasonably necessary to achieve its objectives” and
    concluded that she was not satisfied that police “would or should have had the
    ability to narrow the scope of their search of the computer in this case.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge
    conflated the difficulty of imposing pre-search protocols with an after the
    fact assessment of whether the search was unreasonably conducted. A search may
    still be conducted in an unreasonable manner even if authorized by a search
    warrant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant points to paras. 72 and 73 of the
    trial judge’s reasons to support this argument:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>But, the Supreme Court of Canada has
    recognized that it is very difficult to impose effective limits, in advance, on
    the search of a computer. As Cromwell J. stated at para. 57 of <em>Vu</em>, at
    the point at which police are seeking a warrant and the issuing justice is
    considering imposing parameters on the search to be conducted,</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote>57… an authorizing justice is
    unlikely to be able to predict, in advance, the kinds of investigative
    techniques that police can and should employ in a given search or foresee the
    challenges that will present themselves once police begin their search. In
    particular, the ease with which individuals can hide documents on a computer
    will often make it difficult to predict where police will need to look to find
    the evidence they are searching for. For example, an authorizing justice’s
    decision to limit a search for child pornography to image files may cause
    police to miss child pornography that is stored as a picture in a <i>Word</i> document. In short, attempts to impose search protocols during the
    authorization process risk creating blind spots in an investigation,
    undermining the legitimate goals of law enforcement that are recognized in the
    pre-authorization process. These problems are magnified by rapid and constant
    technological change.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In my view, this was a case in which it was
    appropriate not to place limits on the scope of the police search for evidence
    of the offences. The ITO explained the very broad search that was to be
    conducted and the police were authorized to do this. There is no evidence
    before me that the police would or should have had the ability to narrow the
    scope of their search of the computer in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge discussed both advance
    restrictions on computer searches and the reasonableness of the manner of
    search. Reading her reasons as a whole, I interpret her reasons as a conclusion
    that the manner of search here was reasonable. I agree with that conclusion.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where a user has some child pornography on his
    or her computer, identified by the search methods used initially by police
    here, it is not unreasonable to look at the other image and video files on the
    computer to see if there is more child pornography there. Searching by hash
    value would only uncover known examples of child pornography already in the
    police database and would also miss any of those known examples if the hash
    value had been changed in any way, whether intentionally or not. A search that relied
    on the name attached to a file might not uncover further child pornography
    files as a user could attach any name he or she wished to an image or video or
    folder and that name might not be indicative of its content. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given this context, it was reasonable for police
    to look at all image and video files when they were looking for images and
    videos of child pornography. It was also reasonable for them to examine the
    internet search history and the dates and times of access to the appellant’s internet
    accounts to identify the person searching for child pornography. Here, in
    addition to the appellant, three other persons were potential users of the
    computer, namely the appellant’s father (the owner of the home and the
    subscriber assigned to the IP address), his sister (who had a user profile on
    the computer) and his sister’s boyfriend (who visited the home). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, there is no evidence that the police
    looked at documents, banking records or other programs or files unrelated to
    the search for child pornography and the identity of the person in possession
    of that material. The search was appropriately tailored to the type of evidence
    being sought and the offences being alleged. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As this court noted in <em>R. v. Jones</em>,
    2011 ONCA 632, 107 O.R. (3d) 241, at paras. 43-44:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The focus on the type of evidence being
    sought, as opposed to the type of files that may be examined is helpful, it
    seems to me, particularly in cases where it may be necessary for the police to
    do a wide-ranging inspection of the contents of the computer in order to ensure
    that evidence has not been concealed or its resting place in the bowels of the
    computer cleverly camouflaged.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>To the extent they are required to examine any
    file or folder on the computer to reasonably accomplish that authorized search,
    the police are entitled to open those files and folders and to examine them, at
    least in a cursory fashion, in order to determine whether they are likely to
    contain evidence of the type they are seeking. [Citations omitted].</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept the argument that there must be
    prior evidence of concealment of incriminating evidence before police can look
    at all images and videos stored on a computer in this kind of investigation
    where some child pornography has been located on the computer on initial
    examination. Rather, a search of all images and videos is appropriate in an
    investigation like this precisely to determine whether there is more child
    pornography on the computer. To limit police to searches by hash values, file
    names and download folders would be to provide a roadmap for concealment of
    files containing child pornography. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I also do not accept the argument that the
    search was overbroad because it was not tailored to a date range in terms of
    the files searched. Here the police were looking for images and videos of child
    pornography and evidence that might show who was responsible for that content.
    This was not a broad search of multiple devices or large amounts of data unrelated
    to the specific investigation, such as in <em>R. v. Sop</em>, 2014 ONSC 4610,
    at paras.116-149, or <em>R. v. Marek</em>,<em> </em>2016 ABQB 18, at paras.
    120-147.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, I reject the argument that the search
    of all images and videos here was overly invasive because the vast majority of
    the offending material would have been located using a combination of hash
    value comparison, keyword searching of file name, and searching the file
    folders most likely to contain child pornography. This argument fails because
    it uses the ultimate results or fruits of the search to dictate whether the
    scope of the search was reasonable. Given the limitations of searching only by
    hash value or file or folder name discussed above, hindsight should not be used
    in this way to turn what was once a reasonable search in all the circumstances
    into an unreasonable one.  </span></p>

    should be excluded based on the <em>Spencer</em> breach alone. I agree with the
    trial judge’s conclusion that that breach does not justify exclusion of the
    fruits of the search of the computer under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. </span></p>

    but to then impose a mandatory six-month jail sentence on the 18-year-old

    Equally, the appellant submits that to send an 18-year-old to jail for six

    held that the criminal prohibitions on possession of child pornography went too
    far by criminalizing possession of materials that arguably posed little or no
    risk to children, and in a manner that seriously affected freedom of

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The second category would protect
    auto-depictions, such as photographs taken by a child or adolescent of him- or
    herself alone, kept in strict privacy and intended for personal use only. It
    would also extend to protect the recording of lawful sexual activity, provided
    certain conditions were met. The person possessing the recording must have
    personally recorded or participated in the sexual activity in question. That
    activity must not be unlawful, thus ensuring the consent of all parties, and
    precluding the exploitation or abuse of children. All parties must also have
    consented to the creation of the record. The recording must be kept in strict
    privacy by the person in possession, and intended exclusively for private use
    by the creator and the persons depicted therein. Thus, for example, a teenage
    couple would not fall within the law’s purview for creating and keeping
    sexually explicit pictures featuring each other alone, or together engaged in
    lawful sexual activity, provided these pictures were created together and
    shared only with one another.</span></p>

    responsibility. It is clear that the private use exception cannot apply to the
    third hypothetical (18-year-old who fails to delete a “sext” from a friend’s

    disproportionate. Most members of the community would consider a six-month jail
    sentence a substantial interference with individual liberty and would find it
    intolerable that such a punishment could be applied to this behaviour,
    especially given the number of images/videos involved (one single image), the
    nature of the image in question (lawfully self-created), the manner of
    acquisition (passive recipient) and the nature of the offender (young adult). </span></p>

    images of children as young as four years old, and some perhaps as young as two
