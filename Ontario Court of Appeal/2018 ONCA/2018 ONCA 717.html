  <h1><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neil and Randi Shinder were married on July 28,
    1996 and have two children, ages 21 and 20.  The couple separated on September
    9, 2009.  They entered into a Separation Agreement on June 25, 2012 and
    subsequent Minutes of Settlement varying that Agreement on February 27, 2014. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2016, Randi commenced proceedings against
    Neil and Neil’s father, Solomon (“Sol”), seeking, among other things, an order
    to set aside the Separation Agreement and the Minutes of Settlement.   She
    asserted that, when she entered into the Separation Agreement and the Minutes
    of Settlement, she was aware that Sol had established the Solomon and Zelaine<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Shinder Canadian Grandchildren
    Family Trust (the “Trust”) but did not know that Neil was a beneficiary.  She
    asserted that his interest had not been disclosed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>  Neil and Sol brought motions for summary
    judgment to dismiss Randi’s application.  The motions judge dismissed Neil’s
    motion for summary judgment, granted Sol partial summary judgment (insofar as
    he was not required to produce an Affidavit of Documents), and, although not
    requested, granted partial summary judgment in Randi’s favour on two issues. 
    First, the motions judge found that Neil deliberately failed to disclose his
    interest in the Trust to Randi.  Second, she found that Randi did not know of Neil’s
    interest in the Trust prior to entering into the Separation Agreement and the
    Minutes of Settlement, and as such, Neil’s defence that Randi knew of his
    interest could not succeed.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neil and Sol appeal from this order.  For the
    reasons that follow, I would allow Neil’s appeal, with the exception of paragraph
    7 of the order below, which remains in effect, and which remits certain issues
    to mediation/arbitration as the parties agreed.  I would also allow Sol’s appeal.
      </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At their date of marriage in 1996, Neil held 48
    common shares in Coofer Holdings Inc. (“Coofer”), a company controlled by Sol. Two
    years prior to the couple’s separation, Sol reorganized his holdings, including
    his shares in Coofer, initiated an estate freeze, and, with the consent of his
    two sons, established separate trusts (one Canadian and one American) for each
    of his son’s families.  As found by the motions judge, Sol’s stated intention
    was to pass the benefit of future growth in his estate to his five
    grandchildren, including Randi and Neil’s two children.  The Canadian Trust
    holds common shares of Coofer.  As a result of this estate freeze, on January
    1, 2008, in exchange for the surrender of his common shares in Coofer, Neil
    received preference shares in Coofer having a fixed value of $1,106,784 with no
    voting rights and with dividends payable at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While they were married, Randi and Neil
    developed companies that marketed and distributed beauty products.  Randi
    handled the creative component of the business including product development
    and marketing, and Neil handled the day-to-day operations and finances of the
    businesses.  The companies were very successful, and by the parties’
    separation, they were worth tens of millions of dollars.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On separation, Randi and Neil proceeded to
    negotiate the terms governing the demise of their marriage.  Their financial
    affairs were complex, and they held significant assets.  Indeed, two years
    prior to their separation, they had sold one of their corporations for
    approximately $80 million.  Based on his income tax return for the year 2009,
    Neil had gross annual income in excess of $14 million, as did Randi.  Each of
    them retained experienced counsel and accountants to assist in identifying, evaluating,
    and dividing their holdings.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Randi commenced proceedings against Neil on
    December 7, 2010.  Among other things, she requested an unequal division of the
    parties’ net family property.  In her application, Randi noted that Neil had an
    interest in various entities including Coofer.  She stated that Coofer had
    undergone a reorganization; new shares had been issued; and “[v]irtually no
    information has been provided about this reorganization.”  She requested full
    and complete disclosure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties exchanged Financial Statements.  Although
    he listed his share interest in Coofer and that he was a beneficiary of an
    entirely different Shinder Family Trust, Neil did not list his additional interest
    as a beneficiary under the Trust in his sworn Financial Statements, dated April
    5, 2011 and November 22, 2011.  He identified excluded property as having a nil
    value.  In his November 22, 2011 Financial Statement, he identified the
    $1,106,784 redemption value of the preferred shares in Coofer, noting that no
    dividends were expected to be paid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On April 8, 2011, Randi and Neil consented to an
    order addressing disclosure and questioning at a Case Conference conducted by
    Herman J.  Neil was ordered to provide a disclosure request to Randi by April
    29, 2011; Randi was ordered to provide any additional disclosure requests to
    Neil by April 15, 2011; Neil was ordered to reply by May 15, 2011; and Randi
    was ordered to reply by May 30, 2011.  In addition, leave for questioning was
    granted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Pursuant to that order, on April 14, 2011, Randi’s
    counsel, Annie Noa Kenet of the law firm Goldhart &amp; Associates, wrote to Neil’s
    counsel, Harold Niman and Daryl Gelgoot, and requested itemized information identified
    by Andrew Freedman of Duff &amp; Phelps, the accountant retained on behalf of
    Randi.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There were 131 items listed and numerous
    headings in the letter.  Among other things, Ms. Kenet sought rent rolls for
    certain properties at the date immediately preceding Coofer’s reorganization,
    at the date of separation, and currently.  Ms. Kenet also sought information on
    the Trust.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By letter dated May 13, 2011, Neil’s valuator,
    Linda Brent of Brent Valuations Inc., responded to the information identified by
    Mr. Freedman.  Her 23 pages of answers together with enclosures were forwarded
    to Mr. Gelgoot. The enclosures referred to in the responses were contained on
    an attached CD and were also listed on an accompanying index.  Ms. Brent wrote
    that, if Mr. Gelgoot had any questions, he should not hesitate to contact her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Brent responded that the request for rent
    rolls before reorganization and currently was not relevant.  Further
    consideration would be given to the request if particulars of the purpose and
    its relevancy were provided.  Furthermore, the information was not in Neil’s
    possession but had been requested from Sol who had refused to provide it for reasons
    of confidentiality relating to the interests of third parties from whom consent
    was required.  As for the information as of the date of separation, Ms. Brent
    noted that Neil held fixed value preference shares and since his contingent
    interest in the Trust was received as a gift during marriage and was excluded
    property, the request was not relevant.  She reiterated that further
    consideration would be given to the request if particulars of the purpose and
    relevancy were provided and repeated the problem relating to Sol,
    confidentiality, and the need for third party consent.  Essentially the same
    answer was given in response to Ms. Kenet’s request for the fair market value
    of marketable securities held by Coofer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under the heading “S&amp;Z Canadian
    Grandchildren Family Trust”, the following items were requested by Randi’s
    advisors: the Trust indenture; Trust returns for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010; financial
    statements for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010; and the ages and names of Sol and
    Zelaine’s grandchildren.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Brent identified and enclosed the Trust
    indenture for the S&amp;Z Canadian Grandchildren Family Trust, dated December
    4, 2007.  The Trust indenture described Neil as an Original Trustee, along with
    Sol and Zelaine.  Both Neil and Randi were also described as beneficiaries,
    although Randi was a beneficiary only while she and Neil lived together in a
    conjugal relationship: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>1.(c) “beneficiary” means the person or
    persons who are entitled to any benefit hereunder whether such benefit is
    contingent or absolute or whether such benefit is a right to receive income or
    capital or is an interest in income or capital of the trust fund, and without
    limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall include SOLOMON SHINDER,
    ZELAINE SHINDER, NEIL SHINDER, RANDI SHINDER and the children of NEIL SHINDER;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>(i) provided that ZELAINE SHINDER shall
    only be a beneficiary of this Trust upon the death of her husband, SOLOMON
    SHINDER;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>(ii) and provided that the spouse of NEIL
    SHINDER shall only be a beneficiary of this Trust while she and NEIL SHINDER
    live together in a conjugal relationship[.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>In addition, the Trust Indenture
    provided that any beneficiary’s interest in the Trust property or its interest
    was excluded property for family law purposes:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-US>22. The Interest of any beneficiary in any
    property of the Trust, any income from property of the Trust, any accretion in
    value of property of the Trust and any property into which the above mentioned
    property can be traced, including any income from the traced property, shall
    constitute his or her exclusive property and <u>shall be excluded from his or
    her net family property</u>, as such term is defined in the <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3 as amended, and shall not form part of any present or
    deferred community of property or value shareable with his or her spouse under
    the laws of any jurisdiction. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In response to the request for production of the
    Trust returns, Ms. Brent responded that no tax returns had been filed, but she
    enclosed an exemption for fiscal years 2009 and 2010.  She stated that no
    financial statements had been prepared for the years 2007 to 2010.  She
    provided the ages and names of the children of Neil and Randi but stated that
    those of the other grandchildren were not relevant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As mentioned, in her letter, Ms. Brent also
    described Neil’s interest in the trust as “contingent” and as “excluded
    property”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her cross-examination for the purposes of the
    summary judgment motion, Randi stated that she did not read Ms. Brent’s letter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> In his Affidavit sworn June 17, 2011, Neil

  <h1><span lang=EN-US>MOTIONS JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the summary judgment motions brought by Neil
    and Sol, the motions judge identified the only issue for consideration as being
    whether there was a triable issue that Neil had failed to disclose that he was
    a beneficiary of the Trust.  She noted that, under s. 56(4)(a) of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, the court may set aside a domestic contract
    if a party has failed to disclose to the other significant assets existing when
    the domestic contract was made.  She went on to emphasize the need to make
    disclosure and stressed that accurate and complete Financial Statements are
    crucially important and particularly so in complex cases.  She found that Neil
    had failed to disclose his interest in the Trust in his Financial Statements. 
    She was unable to determine from the evidence before her whether Randi’s
    counsel, accountant or advisors were aware of the terms of the Trust.  However,
    relying on <em>Virc v. Blair</em>, 2014 ONCA 392, 119 O.R. (3d) 721, she
    determined that there had been non-disclosure, and Neil and Sol had failed to
    show that Randi knew of Neil’s interest in the Trust.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge went on to conclude that it
    was unnecessary to have a trial on the issue of non-disclosure.  She dismissed
    Neil’s motion for summary judgment and granted Randi partial summary judgment
    on two issues: (i) that Neil had deliberately failed to disclose his interest
    in the Trust to Randi; and (ii) that Randi did not have actual knowledge of the
    non-disclosure when she entered into the June 25, 2012 Separation Agreement. 
    Neil’s attempt to defend the action on the grounds of Randi’s knowledge could
    not succeed.  The motions judge left for further hearing, following full
    disclosure by Neil, whether Neil’s failure to disclose that he was a
    beneficiary of the Trust was material or significant non-disclosure within the
    meaning of s. 56 of the <em>Family Law Act</em>.  In addition, Neil was to file
    a sworn Financial Statement, and he was to answer refusals arising from his
    cross-examination and produce the documents requested by Randi.  The motions
    judge also ordered that unless the Separation Agreement was set aside on the
    ground of non-disclosure, all of the other issues raised (section 7 expenses,
    child support, contents, and any other alleged breaches related to the failure
    to share tax benefits, etc.) were to be dealt with by the mediation/arbitration
    process stipulated in the Separation Agreement.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for Sol’s request for summary judgment, the
    motions judge found that, although he was aware that Neil was a beneficiary of
    the Trust, Sol had failed “to squarely reveal the truth.”  In his Affidavit, Sol
    had stated that the ultimate residual beneficiaries of the Trust were Neil and
    Randi’s children.  He had attached a corporate chart that showed Neil and Randi
    as Trust beneficiaries, but the motions judge stated that it was in fine print
    and barely legible. </span></p>

    Sol’s motion for summary judgment and such a dismissal is not found in the
    order.  It would appear that the motions judge implicitly dismissed his
    motion.  She also ordered Sol to answer refusals from his cross-examination and
    to produce the documents requested by Randi.  The motions judge dismissed
    Randi’s request for Sol to file an Affidavit of Documents with respect to
    assets owned by Neil at marriage and separation.</span></p>

    information to be provided.</span></p>

    years preceding the couple’s separation, and a Coofer valuation report prepared
    to effect the estate freeze and to value Neil’s shares in Coofer.  Furthermore,

    trial.  Section 4(2) of the <em>Family Law Act</em> excludes from net family
    property, and therefore from equalization, any property “acquired by gift or
    inheritance from a third person after the date of the marriage.” The Trust 
    comprised Sol’s property and Neil’s common shares in Coofer that had originally
    been given to him by Sol and then exchanged for preference shares that were
    disclosed to Randi and included in both of Neil’s Financial Statements.  In the
    face of the disclosure of these Coofer shares, any additional benefits Neil
    might receive under the Trust would constitute a gift or inheritance acquired
    after the date of the marriage and hence would have to constitute excluded
    property as defined under the <em>Family Law Act</em>.  Although not
    determinative, this is consistent with s. 22 of the Trust Indenture, which
    declares any benefit received by any beneficiary under the Trust to be excluded
    property for family law purposes.  Ms. Brent responded to the questions posed
    by Randi’s advisors and also noted that Neil’s interest in the Trust would have
    to constitute excluded property.  One may reasonably conclude that this factor
    informed the decision made on Randi’s behalf to forego further questioning on
    the Trust despite Ms. Brent’s invitation for particulars on the purpose and
    relevancy of the request.  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-US>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neil’s Motion for </span>Summary<span
lang=EN-US> Judgment and the Interlocutory Provisions of the Order Below</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neil also asserts that the motions judge erred
    in refusing to grant his motion for summary judgment.  In his notice of motion seeking
    summary judgment, Neil had requested that Randi’s Application be dismissed in
    its entirety.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given the process and Randi’s knowledge, there
    is no genuine issue requiring a trial on the issue of non-disclosure.  It
    follows that there could be no genuine issue requiring a trial for damages for
    conspiracy to commit fraud, deceit or punitive damages, all of which rely on
    the same constellation of facts as set out in Randi’s Amended Application. I
    would grant Neil’s request for summary judgment in this regard.  As such, I
    would dismiss the claims asserted in paragraphs 1, 2, 11, 12, and 13 of Randi’s
    Amended Application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for the other issues raised by Randi, the
    motions judge stated, at para. 7 of her order: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Unless the Separation Agreement is set aside
    in its entirety on the narrow ground of the non-disclosure of Neil’s interest
    in the Trust, all of the other issues raised (section 7 expenses, child
    support, contents, and any other alleged breaches related to failure to share
    tax benefits, etc.) shall be dealt with by the Mediation/Arbitration process
    stipulated in the Separation Agreement.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I see no reason to interfere with this
    disposition.  The Separation Agreement remains in force as do the Minutes of Settlement.
     All other outstanding issues should be resolved by the s. 6 mediation/arbitration
    process in the Separation Agreement and s.20 of the Minutes of Settlement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would also allow Neil’s appeal from the
    interlocutory provisions, at para. 4, of the order under appeal.  They derive
    from Randi’s claim that the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement be
    set aside on the basis of non-disclosure, which cannot succeed.  Thus, they
    have no further relevance.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-US>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Costs</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Neil asks that the costs award of $70,000 in
    Randi’s favour be set aside, and that the costs below and of the appeal be
    awarded to him instead.  Generally, in family and other civil proceedings,
    costs follow the event.  Certainly, Neil should be entitled to his costs of the
    appeal and the Divisional Court proceedings.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would, therefore, order those costs to be paid
    by Randi to Neil fixed in the amount of $30,000 on a partial indemnity scale,
    inclusive of disbursements and applicable tax.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for costs below, I would set aside the order
    for $70,000 in favour of Randi, and order Neil and Randi to bear their own costs
    of those proceedings.  Although Neil was successful, given the omissions in his
    2011 Financial Statements, it is fair and reasonable that Neil bear some of the
    burden for the proceedings.  </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sol’s Grounds of Appeal</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As mentioned, Sol submits that the motions judge
    erred (i) in granting partial summary judgment in Randi’s favour and failing to
    grant summary judgment in his favour because the motions judge did not apply
    the relevant law to his motion for summary judgment; (ii) in finding that Neil intentionally
    failed to disclose his interest in the Trust; and (iii) in ordering costs of
    the motion in the amount of $70,000 against Sol and Neil.   As mentioned, he
    also appeals the interlocutory provisions of the motions judge’s order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since the second ground of appeal overlaps with
    Neil’s and has already been addressed, I will only discuss the other three
    grounds.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with Sol that the motions judge erred in
    her treatment of his motion for summary judgment.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge did not consider the requisite
    tests to establish the claims asserted against Sol: conspiracy to commit fraud,
    deceit, and punitive damages. If she had, it would have been clear that these
    tests could not be met based on the record before her and that there was no
    genuine issue requiring a trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On a motion for summary judgment, each party has
    to “put their best foot forward” in relation to any material issues to be tried: <em>Sanzone v. Schechter</em>, 2016 ONCA 566, 402 D.L.R. (4th) 135, at para.
    32.</span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'> 
    Here, Randi did not adduce evidence that would support the requisite elements of
    the causes of action and claims asserted against Sol.  </span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the conspiracy to commit fraud claim, there simply is no evidence to sustain
    the requirement that the course of conduct adopted by Sol had the predominant
    purpose of causing injury to Randi or that his conduct was unlawful, directed
    towards Randi, and in circumstances where he should have known that injury to
    her would likely result.  See: <em>Cement Lafarge v. B.C. Lightweight Aggregate</em><i>,</i> [1983] 1 S.C.R. 452.  Sol’s intention, as found by the motions judge, was to
    implement an estate freeze to organize his corporate and personal affairs to pass
    on the benefit of future growth to his grandchildren.  He effected the freeze
    two years before Randi and Neil separated and initially, she too was a
    beneficiary.  Moreover, no injury ensued. Similarly, with the claim of deceit,
    this claim cannot be sustained.  I have already concluded that Neil’s interest
    in the Trust was disclosed.  In the light of this conclusion, a finding of
    deceit could not be grounded in Sol’s statement that the ultimate beneficiaries
    were Neil and Randi’s children coupled with the corporate chart that disclosed
    Neil’s interest. Lastly, again there is no evidence to support Randi’s claim of
    punitive damages.  No finding could be made that Sol’s conduct was “malicious,
    oppressive and high-handed” such that it “offends the court’s sense of
    decency”: <em>Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co</em><i>.</i>, 2002 SCC 18, at para.
    36.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It follows that Sol’s motion for summary
    judgment should have been granted.  Given this outcome, I would also allow
    Sol’s appeal from the interlocutory provisions of the order.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I would allow Neil’s appeal
    in part.  That is, paragraph 7 of the underlying order shall remain in effect
    to the extent that it permits Randi to pursue the other issues she raises (as
    described by the motions judge, section 7 expenses, child support, contents, as
    well as any other alleged breaches related to a failure to share tax benefits,
    etc.) through the mediation/arbitration process stipulated in the Separation
    Agreement.  I would set aside the partial summary judgment in favour of Randi, dismiss
    Randi’s claim that the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement be set
    aside on the basis of non-disclosure of Neil’s interest in the Trust, and set
    aside the costs order below.  I would order Neil and Randi to bear their own
    costs of the proceedings below and would order Randi to pay Neil’s costs of the
    appeal, including the Divisional Court proceedings, on a partial indemnity
    scale fixed in the amount of $30,000, inclusive of disbursements and applicable
    tax.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would allow Sol’s appeal.  I would order Randi
    to pay $20,000 in costs of the proceedings below.  In addition, she is to pay costs
    of the appeal, including the Divisional Court proceedings, on a partial
    indemnity scale fixed in the amount of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements and
    applicable tax.  Although fraud was pleaded, it played a minimal role in the
    argument and analysis, and I am satisfied that a partial indemnity costs award
    is fair and reasonable in the circumstances. </span></p>
