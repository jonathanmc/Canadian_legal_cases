    2018 ONSC 7286, 56 C.B.R. (6th) 37.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Sharpe J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal concerns complex commercial
    agreements between two sophisticated parties. The appellant, ClearFlow Energy
    Finance Corp. (“ClearFlow”) made a number of loans to the respondent, Solar
    Power Network Inc. and its affiliate companies (“Solar Power”). The loans were risky
    given the nature of Solar Power’s renewable energy projects that ClearFlow was
    financing. Solar Power defaulted on the loans and disputed the amount of
    interest owing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the core of the dispute is a term in the loan
    agreements requiring Solar Power to pay a “discount fee” of .003 percent of the
    outstanding loans on the repayment date and for every day thereafter while the loan
    remains outstanding. Solar Power contends that the discount fee fails to comply
    with the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Interest Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>,
    R.S.C. 1985 c. I-15, s. 4, which requires that any written agreement for the
    payment of interest at a rate or percentage per day, week, month or any period
    less than one year contain “an express statement of the yearly rate or
    percentage of interest to which the other rate or percentage is equivalent.”
    Section 4 provides that where an agreement fails to comply with this
    requirement, “no interest exceeding the rate or percentage of five per cent per
    annum shall be chargeable”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge accepted Solar Power’s
    arguments and held that ClearFlow was entitled only to interest at the rate of
    5% per annum in total despite  the fact that the loan agreements provided for
    interest to accrue at 12% per annum before maturity, and 24% thereafter in addition
    to the .003% discount fee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ClearFlow appeals to this court, arguing that: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>the “discount fee” is not interest; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>in any event, the loan agreements contain an
    annualizing formula that satisfies s. 4; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Solar Power entered forbearance agreements
    acknowledging its indebtedness, and cannot now dispute the interest owing; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpLast><span lang=EN-US>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>in the alternative, the appropriate remedy is to
    limit the application of s. 4 to the discount fee rather than reduce the
    interest payable on the entire agreement to 5%. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Solar Power cross-appeals the application
    judge’s finding that certain “administration fees” provided for in the loan
    agreements do not constitute interest within the meaning of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Interest Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, s. 4.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the following reasons, I conclude that the
    application judge did not err as to whether the administrative fees and the
    discount fee are interest. He did, however, err by finding that the discount
    fee contravenes the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Interest Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, and by holding that all interest payable under the loan agreements
    should be limited to 5%.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Beginning in 2015, ClearFlow, a project-finance
    company, made a series of loans to Solar Power to finance the development and
    construction of renewable energy projects. Renewable energy projects are
    complex, high cost, and difficult to finance. After ClearFlow made two initial
    loans to Solar Power, the parties signed a Loan Agreement that provided for two
    types of loans: Construction Loans for up to 90 days and Warehouse Loans with
    terms of up to 180 days while Solar Power arranged long-term financing. The
    parties also negotiated a number of additional loans by way of Promissory
    Notes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>All of the loans have three components material
    to this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First is a base rate of interest, typically 12%
    per annum compounded and calculated monthly, and 24% per annum in the event of
    default. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second is an administrative fee of either 1.81%
    or 3.55%, charged when the loan was advanced and, if not paid off, each time
    the loan is renewed (</span><em>i.e.</em><span lang=EN-US> not paid by the
    expiry of the term).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third is the discount fee of 0.003% of the
    principal amount of the loan payable on the due date of the loan and every day
    thereafter until the loan is repaid. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These three terms are reflected in art. 2.2 of
    the Loan Agreement:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Each Borrower agrees to pay interest in arrears
    on the outstanding principal amount of each Loan advanced to such Borrower at
    the rate of 12% per annum, compounded and calculated monthly, both before and
    after maturity, default and judgement…Following the occurrence of an Event of
    Default which is continuing, interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding
    principal amount at the rate of 24% per annum until paid. Each Borrower further
    agrees to pay to the Lender: (i) on the date of advance of each Loan advanced
    to such Borrower under the Construction Loan Facility, an administration fee of
    1.81% of the amount of such Loan; (ii) on the date of advance of each Loan
    advanced to such Borrower under the Warehouse Loan Facility, an administration
    fee of 1.81% of the amount of such Loan; and (iii) on the date of repayment of
    such Loan (as set out in Section 2.4 or 2.5, as applicable), a discount fee of
    0.003% of the outstanding balance of such Loan for every day such Loan remains
    outstanding until such Loan is repaid in full. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Solar Power borrowed over $40 million from
    ClearFlow between 2015 and 2017 pursuant to the loan documents. In 2016, Solar
    Power began to encounter financial difficulties and defaulted on many of the
    loans. The parties entered Forbearance Agreements in July, October, and
    November 2016, as well as April 2017. Solar Power acknowledged its
    indebtedness, and ClearFlow agreed to forbear on Solar Power’s default and to
    provide further financing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The total amount of accrued interest is
    approximately $10 million. Solar Power has now secured replacement financing,
    and funds sufficient to cover the amount in dispute are being held in trust
    pending resolution of this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I have already indicated, the central issues
    on the application and on this appeal are whether the Loan Agreement complied
    with the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Interest Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US>,
    s. 4 and the appropriate remedy if it is non-compliant. Section 4 provides as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>Except as
    to mortgages on real property or hypothecs on immovables, whenever any interest
    is, by the terms of any written or printed contract, whether under seal or not,
    made payable at a rate or percentage per day, week, month, or at any rate or
    percentage for any period less than a year, no interest exceeding the rate or
    percentage of five per cent per annum shall be chargeable, payable or
    recoverable on any part of the principal money unless the contract contains an
    express statement of the yearly rate or percentage of interest to which the
    other rate or percentage is equivalent.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>REASONS OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before the application judge, Solar Power took
    the position that the administration fees and the discount fee amounted to
    interest within the meaning of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Interest Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, s. 4. As the Loan Agreement and the Promissory Notes did not state
    an equivalent annual percentage or rate of interest, Solar Power argued that the
    interest payable should be capped at 5%.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Administration fees</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge found that the
    administration fees did not constitute interest within the meaning of s. 4. He
    accepted ClearFlow’s evidence that the administration fees were compensation
    for administrative work in setting up and administering the loans, rather than
    a return on the money lent. Negotiating the loans involved the preparation of
    thousands of documents. At para. 32, the application judge found that “it is
    commercially reasonable to accept the proposition that the administration fee
    was intended to compensate ClearFlow for the work it did in entering into and
    administering the various loan documents”. The application judge noted that the
    administration fee did not accrue on a day-to-day basis during the term of each
    loan but was charged on a one-time-only basis and was only charged again if the
    loan was not repaid as specified. He concluded, at para. 39, that the administrative
    fee “was not simply compensation for ClearFlow not having the use of the
    money”. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Discount fee</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge found that the discount
    fee was interest. He rejected ClearFlow’s contention that it simply provided
    additional compensation for daily administration of the loans. The discount fee
    was not linked to the creation of a new loan or a renewal, it was the same for
    all types of loans, and it was calculated on a daily fixed rate. These factors
    suggested interest rather than a fee, as did the concession of ClearFlow’s
    affiant that the fees “incentivized [Solar Power] to make earlier payout of the
    Loans”. The discount fee had the three essential elements of interest. First, it
    was compensation for the use or retention of money; second, it related to the
    principal amount owing; third, it accrued over time. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Annualizing Formula</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Loan Agreement (but not the Promissory
    Notes) contains a formula to calculate the annual rate for both the
    administration fee and the discount fee:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>1.2 Interest and Fee Calculations, Maximum
    Interest Rate</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Unless otherwise stated, in this Agreement if
    reference is made to a rate of interest, discount rate, fee or other amount
    “per annum” or a similar expression is used, such interest, fee or other amount
    shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
    be. If the amount of any interest, fee or other amount is determined or
    expressed on the basis of a period of less than one year of 365 or 366 days, as
    the case may be, the equivalent yearly rate is equal to the rate so determined or
    expressed, divided by the number of days in the said period, and multiplied by
    the actual number of days in that calendar year. </span></p>

    judge and before this court is that the annualizing formula provides a simple
    and adequate method to determine the annualized interest and thereby brings the

lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, he found, at para. 53, that a formula
    could not satisfy the purpose of the statutory requirement for an express,
    annualized statement of interest, because “[f]ormulas can be confusing and even
    misleading”. He noted that confusion has arisen in this case about the amount
    of interest owing and suggested that this was the very mischief at which s. 4
    was aimed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, he found that the annualizing formula did
    not provide the information required by s. 4 because it did not take into
    account compounding of interest. The annualizing formula would produce an
    annualized rate of 1.095% (0.003% x 365 days) but the actual interest rate
    would depend on a number of compound periods of interest as the discount fee
    was compounded each time the loan rolled over. </span></p>

    submission that Solar Power was precluded from challenging the amount of
    interest owing by virtue of the Forbearance Agreements. The first Forbearance
    Agreement and the Second Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement provided
    that the indebtedness, including interest, was “unconditionally owing… without
    offset, defence or counterclaim of any kind, nature or description whatsoever”.
    However, the Third Amended and Restated Forbearance Agreement, which amends and
    replaces the earlier agreements, added to those words “except as may otherwise
    be required by applicable laws”. The application judge found that the added
    language permitted Solar Power to challenge the rate of interest. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his view, this remedy was required by the
    language of s. 4 that states that no interest shall be charged above the rate
    of 5% on any part of the principal money if any interest is not expressed on an
    annual basis. Any other interpretation would allow lenders to obscure the
    interest rate by charging a series of non-annualized rates individually lower
    than 5%. The </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Interest Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, s. 4 is consumer protection legislation and he rejected the
    contention that courts should interpret the provision differently for
    sophisticated borrowers and lenders. While he acknowledged that the result was “harsh”
    and “draconian”, he found that meeting the objectives of the legislation
    required it. </span></p>

    administrative fees were paid at the start of the term of each loan and only

    costs. He found that the discount fee was not linked to the creation or renewal
    of a loan, the amount of the fee did not vary according to the administrative
    work required by the loan as in the case of the administrative fee, and the fee
    was charged at a daily fixed rate unrelated to any ongoing or specific events.
    He characterized ClearFlow’s submission that the discount fee was additional
    compensation for administrative work as “contrived”, and concluded that “[t]he

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[45]<span

lang=EN>Second is the question of compound interest. The application judge held

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The annualizing formula provides a relatively
    simple arithmetic method to calculate the yearly rate to which the daily rate
    is equivalent: </span><span lang=EN-US>multiply 0.003% by 365 days to produce a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>ClearFlow, supported by the intervener, The
    Canadian Bankers’ Association, submits that formulas of this nature are
    regularly used in complex commercial loan agreements and that the case law
    supports their validity as a means to provide borrowers with the kind of
    information required by s. 4. Solar Power supports the application judge’s
    conclusion that unless the agreement explicitly provides the yearly interest,
    s. 4 is not satisfied. Significantly, however, Solar Power does not take the
    position that an annualizing formula can never satisfy the requirements of s.
    4, stating in its factum, “[t]hat question is for another day”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is an issue of statutory interpretation for
    which a standard of correctness applies: </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Mazur v.
    Elias Estate</span></em><span lang=EN-US> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 299 (C.A.) </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I turn first to the actual language of s. 4. It
    requires “an express statement of the yearly </span><span class=Underline>rate
    or percentage</span><em> </em><span lang=EN-US>of interest to which the other
    rate or percentage is equivalent” (emphasis added). By requiring an equivalent
    “rate </span><span class=Underline>or</span><span lang=EN-US> percentage”
    (emphasis added) instead of just employing the word “percentage”, Parliament
    has used language indicating that the effective annual interest need not be
    expressed as a numerical percentage. This is consistent with the interpretive
    presumption that Parliament “does not speak in vain” and includes every word in
    a statute for a purpose: see </span><em>Canada (Attorney General) v.
    JTI-Macdonald Corp.</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2007 SCC 30, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, at

    provides a “rate” for the purpose of s. 4. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge referred to the consumer
    protection purpose of s. 4 and found, at para. 51, that “[f]ormulas can be
    confusing and even misleading”. In my respectful view, that statement is
    difficult to reconcile with the case law accepting the use of formulas, many of
    which are more complex and yield less certain information than the one at issue
    in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For example, formulas are regularly used to determine variable rates
    of interest based upon some standard external to the agreement such as the
    prime bank rate. Such an agreement makes it impossible for the borrower to
    determine in advance the actual amount of interest the borrower would have to
    pay. Yet there seems to be no question that formulas of this nature comply with
    s. 4: see </span><em>e.g.</em> <em>Continental Bank of Canada v. Poyser</em><span
lang=EN-US> (1983), 45 A.R. 305 at para. 23 (Q.B.); </span><em><span

    The </span><em><span lang=EN>Interest Act</span></em><span lang=EN>, s. 3
    stipulates a maximum of 5% interest if “no rate is fixed by the agreement or by

    not deal with the </span><em>Interest Act</em><span lang=EN>, s. 4, I would
    apply the principle of statutory interpretation that “presumes a harmony,
    coherence, and consistency between statutes dealing with the same subject

lang=EN>I also agree with the submission that s. 4 must be interpreted in the
    light of modern commercial reality. It has become common commercial practice
    for some commercial loans to specify that interest is to be calculated on the
    basis of 12 months of thirty days or 360 days and to provide an annualizing
    formula stating that the yearly rate is to be calculated on the basis of the
    specified rate of interest, multiplied by the number of days in the year,
    divided by 360: Alison R. Manzer &amp; Peter Sullivan, </span><em>Canada-U.S.

    to take into account the fact that the discount fee would be compounded if the
    loan was not paid at term and subsequently renewed. In his view, the annualizing

    promissory note that </span><span lang=EN>called for interest at 2% per month,

    the note. The trial judge felt compelled to hold that the note did not comply with
    s. 4. However, he wrote that this result was absurd and a miscarriage of
    justice as it was a simple matter to multiply 2% by 12 months to arrive at an
    equivalent annual interest rate of 24%. This court agreed with the trial judge
    that the promissory note did not comply with s. 4 but disagreed that this
    result was unjust, stating, at p. 126:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>To simply multiply the 2 per cent by 12 months and

lang=EN> the note in </span><em><span lang=EN>Elanco</span></em><span lang=EN> contained no annualizing formula or other method to determine the equivalent
    annual rate. Second, as the interest was calculated monthly, interest would
    compound on a monthly basis during the term of the loan and it was possible to
    calculate an equivalent annual rate that compounding took into account when the
    borrower agreed to the terms of the loan. </span></p>

    the discount fee does not compound during the term of the loan. The discount
    fee is added to the principal on the due date and compounding only starts if
    the loan is not paid. When the Loan Agreement and Promissory Notes were made,
    the parties could not know whether the loan would be paid on the due date. It
    was therefore impossible for them to know whether interest would ever compound.
    In these circumstances,</span><span lang=EN-US> it was sufficient for the

    the “Loan Agreement specifically contemplated” loan extensions, but he failed

    the Loan Agreement, exists only if the loan is not in default. Articles 2.4 and
    2.5 make clear that Solar Power has no right to extend the repayment date for
    the loans. The parties can only know the existence and extent of compounding of
    the discount fee after the due date. The compounding depends upon both whether
    Solar Power decides to repay or to ask ClearFlow that the due date of the loan be
    extended, and whether ClearFlow decides in its “absolute and sole
    discretion...to extend” the 90 or 180 day term. </span></p>

    the Loan Agreement had to state that the discount fee would be “compounded and
    payable every 90 days” or “compounded and payable every 180 days”. There are three
    problems with that submission. First, that formulation would not provide an
    equivalent yearly rate. If it is impossible to provide an equivalent yearly
    effective rate, the only possible conclusion is that a yearly effective rate is
    not required, not that an alternative formulation will suffice. Second, if an
    alternative formulation would suffice, the Loan Agreement already provides one.
    In this sophisticated arrangement, the borrower would know from the terms of
    the agreement that if the loan is not paid at term but renewed, the discount
    fee will be added to the amount owing under the loan and will attract interest
    thereafter. Third, as interest would be calculated by reference to a period
    that is variable, depending upon the extension date, specifying one period
    would not accurately reflect the compounding. </span></p>

    payable monthly and it accumulated and was only payable on the due date of the
    loan. These features also distinguish </span><em>Elanco</em><span lang=EN> from
    the facts of this case. The discount fee is payable at the term date of the
    loan just as the amounts owing on the credit cards in </span><em><span lang=EN>Smith</span></em><span

    reason is convincing. The Loan Agreement does provide, through the annualizing
    formula, an equivalent annual rate and the issue, as in </span><em>Smith</em><span

    into account the effect of compounding. As for the expectation of payment at
    term, I see no meaningful difference between this case and </span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court has repeatedly held that it is necessary to consider the “entire
    context” before settling on what appears, at first blush, to be the plain
    meaning of a legislative provision: see <em>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership
    v. Rex</em>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at paras. 29-30, <em>Bristol-Myers
    Squibb Co. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2005 SCC 26, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 533,
    at paras. 43-44. As Iacobucci J. stated in <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd.
    (Re)</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, “statutory interpretation cannot be
    founded on the wording of the legislation alone”. An isolated plain meaning
    approach can lead courts to interpret statutes in a manner that produces absurd
    results. It is a fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that the
    legislature does not intend to produce such results: <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo
    Shoes</em>, at para. 27.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts
    have repeatedly departed from “plain meaning” when interpreting legislation to
    avoid absurd results. For instance, in <em>NAV Canada</em>, the Supreme Court
    had to consider whether the legal titleholders to passenger aircraft were
    “owners” of those aircraft under s. 55 of the <em>Civil Air Navigation Services
    Commercialization Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 20. The court accepted that the plain
    meaning of “owner” would include the legal titleholder if s. 55 was read in
    isolation. However, the court held that the plain meaning in isolation is not
    determinative and that the provision must be considered in context, including
    the commercial context indicating that a plain language interpretation would
    cause severe disruption to the airline industry: at paras. 44-45, 60. Likewise,
    in <em>Bristol-Myers Squibb</em>, the Supreme Court rejected a “plain meaning”
    interpretation of s. 5(1.1) of the <em>Patented Medicines (Notice of
    Compliance) Regulations</em>, SOR/93-133, as this interpretation would lead to
    commercially absurd results that would inhibit competition in the
    pharmaceutical industry: paras. 66-68. Similarly, in <em>Stonehocker,</em> at
    p. 271, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected a literal interpretation
    of s. 176(1) of the <em>Bills of Exchange Act</em> that disregarded commercial
    reality.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge emphasized the consumer protection purpose of s. 4,
    expressing the concern at para. 82 that “if the 5% limit was only applied to
    the offending interest rates…lenders could easily obscure the total annual
    interest rate by using a series of non-annualized loans that are individually
    less than 5%.” While that may be theoretically possible, it is certainly not
    what happened in the case at bar. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my respectful view, avoiding the possibility envisioned
    by the application judge does not require imposing a harsh and draconian result
    in the circumstances of this case where there plainly was no attempt to subvert
    the law. This case involved a commercial transaction between parties of equal
    bargaining power who inadvertently and only marginally ran afoul of s. 4. There
    was no evidence of intention to break the law, of any unfairness in the
    agreement, or of one party taking advantage of another. </span><span lang=EN>To
    secure the funds it required, Solar Power knew that it had to pay a high rate
    of interest. </span><span lang=EN-US>The discount fee represents a tiny
    fraction of the interest that is otherwise payable and falls well below the 5%
    maximum interest allowed by s. 4. To limit all interest payable to 5% would, as
    the application judge recognized, result in a substantial windfall to Solar
    Power. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge inappropriately privileged the consumer protection purpose of
    s. 4 over the countervailing interpretative principles of fairness to the
    lender and the need to accommodate contemporary commercial practices. In <em>V.K.
    Mason, </em>Wilson J. accepted the consumer protection purpose of s. 4 but also
    found that the sophisticated commercial borrower in that case was in scant need
    of protection and that when construing s. 4, an interpretation that took into
    account the lender’s legitimate interests was appropriate. Using the consumer
    protection purpose as an interpretive tool to favour a sophisticated commercial
    borrower that does not need the protection would not advance the policy of the
    law: <em>V.K. Mason</em>, at p. 287. Similarly, in <em>Potash</em>, at p. 368,
    the Supreme Court held<em> </em>that provisions of the <em>Interest Act, </em>drafted
    in the 1890s, should be interpreted “in keeping with common commercial
    practice” and “to-day’s commercial reality” when their language so permits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent
    any evidence of an attempt to circumvent the protection of s. 4, I would
    interpret the phrase “any interest” in s. 4 to refer only to interest that is
    not stated as a “yearly rate or percentage.” In the circumstances of this case,
    that would mean that the only rate of interest to which s. 4 applies is the
    discount fee. As the discount fee is less than 5% per annum, the statutory
    limit is not exceeded and the discount fee remains payable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reducing
    only the non-compliant rate to 5% takes into account, rather than defeats, the
    lender’s legitimate expectations. As Wilson J. stated in <em>V.K. Mason</em> at
    p. 287, courts must consider these legitimate expectations in interpreting s.
    4. Reducing only the non-compliant rate to 5% appropriately interprets the
    dated text of s. 4 in accordance with contemporary commercial realities. The
    Hansard evidence indicates that Parliament’s concern when it enacted the
    predecessor provision of s. 4 in 1897 was that promissory notes were stating a
    daily or weekly interest rate but not a nominal annual interest rate: see
    Canada, Parliament, <em>House of Commons Debates</em>, 8th Parl., 2nd Sess.,
    Vol. 2 (16 June 1897), at pp. 4252-4258. There is no evidence that Parliament
    turned its mind to contracts that contained multiple interest rates and
    intended the draconian result that the application judge felt compelled to
    reach. In fact, the Hansard evidence suggests that Parliament was concerned to
    achieve its consumer protection objective in a manner that avoided commercially
    absurd results: see Canada, Parliament, <em>Debates of the Senate</em>, 8th
    Parl., 2nd Sess., Vol. 1 (3 June 1897), at pp. 460-461 (Hon. Oliver Mowat).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is analogous to the Supreme Court’s interpretation of s. 10 of the <em>Interest
    Act</em> in <em>Potash</em>, where Wilson J. stated at p. 368 that changing
    commercial practices had resulted in a situation that Parliament had not
    envisaged in the 1890s. In that case, the Court interpreted s. 10 in a way
    consistent with contemporary commercial realities. Likewise, in <em>NAV Canada</em>,
    the Supreme Court construed narrowly a word with a broad plain meaning in part
    because simply applying the broad meaning would have disregarded commercial
    realities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    interpretation means that s. 4 has no effect on the Promissory Notes. Section 4
    only prohibits charging “interest <span class=Underline>exceeding</span> the
    rate or percentage of five per cent per annum” (emphasis added). In other
    words, s. 4 imposes a 5% annual cap on non-annualized interest but does not
    affect an interest rate that is already less than 5% when annualized. The
    discount fee’s yearly rate of 1.095% is significantly less than the 5% cap.
    This interpretation would also prevent lenders from employing s. 4 to increase
    a non-compliant interest rate that is less than 5% to 5% and would correspond
    with s. 3 of the Act, which fixes the rate of interest at 5% per annum only
