  <p class=Heading>INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Chief Adjudicator of the Independent Assessment Process (“IAP”)
    under the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (“IRSSA”) seeks a
    stay of a Direction issued by the Eastern Administrative Judge. The Direction
    at issue prohibits the Chief Adjudicator from continuing his participation in
    three appeals. One of these appeals, the REO Appeal, is before the Supreme
    Court of Canada: see <em>J.W. and REO Law Corporation v. Attorney General of
    Canada et al.</em>, SCC Case Number 37725. Two others are before the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal: see <em>Ronnie Gail Scout v. Attorney General of
    Canada et al.</em>, BCCA File No. CA44379; <em>Larry Philip Fontaine et al. v.
    Attorney General of Canada et al.</em>, BCCA File Nos. CA45085 and CA 45093.
    The REO Appeal is of particular concern because it is scheduled to be heard by
    the Supreme Court of Canada on October 10, 2018. It is expected that the two
    British Columbia appeals will be heard in November and December. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Eastern Administrative Judge issued the Direction on his own
    initiative without notice to the Chief Adjudicator or any other party, and apparently
    without any supporting record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Direction was issued on September 5, 2018 and directs the Chief
    Adjudicator to withdraw from the three appeals by September 13, 2018. Given the
    urgency of this matter, an immediate answer from this court is required and
    accordingly these reasons will be relatively brief.</p>
  <p class=Heading>JURISDICTION </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Respondent the Attorney General of Canada submits that as the
    Direction amounts to an interlocutory case management type order, this Court
    has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and, accordingly, that no stay
    should be granted: <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, ss.
    6(2), 19.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I recognize that as a single judge, I have no final authority to
    determine the issue of jurisdiction. However, as no stay should be granted in a
    case over which this court lacks jurisdiction, I must deal with the issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with the Attorney General’s submission is that the Chief
    Adjudicator is named as a respondent in the REO appeal and has participated as
    a respondent to this point. The Direction requires the Chief Adjudicator to
    withdraw from the appeals and terminate his participation. That amounts to a
    final determination of the Chief Adjudicator’s rights of participation as a
    party and, in my view, is a final order over which this court does have
    jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=Heading>STANDING</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents J.W. and REO Law Corporation submit that the Chief
    Adjudicator lacks standing to bring this appeal. While Chief Adjudicator may in
    certain circumstances participate in appeals brought by others, they argue that
    he has no right to commence an appeal in his own right.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the Chief Adjudicator may not be able to initiate an appeal from
    an IAP decision in his own right, that is not what is involved here. The Chief
    Adjudicator has been named and recognized as a party in the REO appeal. The
    Direction directly targets the Chief Adjudicator’s participation as a party in
    the REO appeal and would terminate that participation. In my view, that gives
    rise to an issue affecting the legal rights of the Chief Adjudicator and he
    therefore does have standing to appeal the Direction.   </p>
  <p class=Heading>THE TEST FOR A STAY</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is common ground that the well-established three-part test for a stay
    applies. The applicant must demonstrate that there is a serious issue to be
    tried; that it will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not granted; and
    that the balance of convenience favours a stay pending the disposition of the
    appeal: <em>RJR -- MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General),</em> [1994] 1
    S.C.R. 311. </p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Serious question to be tried</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied that the Chief Adjudicator’s appeal raises arguable grounds of
    appeal and serious questions to be determined by this court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    neither the Chief Adjudicator nor any other party was given notice of the
    Eastern Administrative Judge’s concern regarding the Chief Adjudicator’s
    participation in the appeals. It is certainly arguable that proceeding without
    notice and without submissions amounted to a denial of procedural justice. It
    is difficult to see why notice and opportunity to address the Eastern
    Administrative Judge’s concerns could and should not have been given. The
    Direction takes the form of a judicial order and the reasons given to support
    it are in the form of a judicial judgment. Accordingly, it is arguable that the
    usual norms of procedural fairness should have been followed. Of particular
    concern is the finding in the Direction that the Chief Adjudicator is guilty of
    “insubordination of the Courts to which he is accountable”. This is a finding
    of serious misconduct made against a lawyer and there is a serious issue as to
    whether it should have been made without giving the lawyer an opportunity to
    respond. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Direction relates to proceedings in other courts. The Chief Adjudicator is
    a respondent or an intervenor to the appeals in those other courts and is
    therefore subject to the control of those courts. The Chief Adjudicator accepts
    that he is subject to the usual limitations imposed upon administrative
    tribunals who participate in proceedings that challenge their decisions as
    outlined in <em>Ontario (Energy Board) v. Ontario Power Generation Inc.</em>,
    2015 SCC 44, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 147. He disputes that he has transgressed those
    limits and submits that if he has, that is an issue for courts before whom the
    Chief Adjudicator appears. I agree with the submission that there is an
    arguable issue as to whether the Eastern Administrative Judge erred in assuming
    the authority to determine the nature and scope of the submissions the Chief
    Adjudicator should make in other courts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    there is an issue as to whether the Chief Adjudicator has exceeded the limits
    of participation permitted for a tribunal in proceedings that challenge the
    tribunal’s decision. The Chief Adjudicator points out that he has regularly
    participated in appeals from decisions of supervising and administrative judges
    and that no issue has been taken with that participation. He strongly contests
    the Eastern Administrative Judge’s characterization of his participation in the
    three appeals at issue and asserts that no one has challenged the Chief
    Adjudicator’s submissions in the three courts as being inappropriate. The Chief
    Adjudicator also submits that the Eastern Administrative Judge erred by finding
    that the Chief Adjudicator cannot challenge decisions of supervising and administrative
    judges on appeal, even if he respects the limits the law imposes on the
    arguments administrative tribunals may make. Again, I am satisfied that these
    amount to serious issues to be tried.</p>
  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Irreparable harm</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada is scheduled to be heard on October
    10. If a stay is not granted and the Chief Adjudicator is required to withdraw
    his factum and participation in that appeal tomorrow, it is difficult to see
    how the matter could be put back on the rails. The effect of denying the stay
    would be, in a practical sense, to deprive the Chief Adjudicator of the
    opportunity to participate in that appeal. It is difficult to see any other
    remedy that would repair that harm. Accordingly I am satisfied that the Chief
    Adjudicator has shown if a stay is denied, he will suffer irreparable harm.</p>
  <h3>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Balance of convenience</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied that the balance of convenience favours granting a stay. If a stay
    is refused, the Chief Adjudicator’s participation in the appeals will be
    terminated and, in one case at least, terminated without hope of resurrection.
    On the other hand if, as the Eastern Administrative Judge thinks, the Chief
    Adjudicator’s participation exceeds the limits of what is permitted, the courts
    before whom the Chief Adjudicator appears can deal with that problem and limit
    his participation accordingly. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that granting a stay effectively determines the issue on appeal in
    favour of the Chief Adjudicator insofar as the REO appeal is concerned. It is
    accepted that where a stay would effectively determine the matter at issue, a
    court may go beyond the “serious issue to be tried” standard and grant the stay
    if the applicant shows a strong likelihood of success: <em>RJR -- Macdonald</em>,
    at p. 338. In my view, the Chief Adjudicator has met that standard,
    particularly with respect to the issue of procedural fairness. </p>
