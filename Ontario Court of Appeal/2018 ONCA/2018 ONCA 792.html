  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard: September 24, 2018</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on March 14, 2015
    by Justice Leitch of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and the complainant met in 2002 and moved in together within
    three months. Their first son was born in 2006. They married in 2007. They had
    a second son in 2008. The relationship ended in 2009. Shortly thereafter the
    complainant alleged that the appellant abused her, verbally, physically, and
    sexually, during the relationship.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant alleged a number of incidents took place in which she
    was sexually assaulted, in addition to an incident involving a non-sexual
    assault, and another in which she was threatened with sexual violence. The
    sexual assault allegations involved the appellant’s demands that the
    complainant submit to anal intercourse and vaginal fisting. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he and the complainant had sex often, in
    fact, so many times that he could recall no specific incidents. He agreed that
    they engaged in the acts that the complainant described, but that it was always
    consensual. The appellant claimed that the allegations <span style='line-height:
200%'>were fabricated as part of a custody dispute.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a six-day jury trial, the appellant was found not guilty on one
    charge of sexual assault, but guilty on all the other charges. He was sentenced
    to 4.5 years in custody, less pre-sentence credit of 78 days. He appeals his
    convictions.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Issues</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main issue the appellant advances is trial fairness. He argues that
    Crown counsel at trial (not Mr. Friesen) pursued improper lines of questioning
    during his testimony. The improper lines of questioning had to do with the
    complainant’s attractiveness and the appellant’s sex drive. He contends that
    the unfairness was compounded when the Crown, in his closing address, argued
    that the appellant was not a credible witness because of his evasive responses
    to the improper questions. The Crown also invited the jury to make improper use
    of the appellant’s demeanour on the stand, characterizing it as “controlling”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant argues that, when the trial judge charged the
    jury she misstated the complainant’s evidence, which had the effect of making her
    evidence appear both internally consistent, and consistent with her father’s testimony
    when it was not. He also argues that the trial judge misstated background evidence
    (<i>i.e.</i>, the toilet paper incident) that related to the charge of
    threatening</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded by the appellant’s submissions on any of the
    grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Crown Conduct and Trial Fairness</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Court has previously described the standard of review for assessing
    the trial fairness arguments advanced by the appellant. First, it will only be
    conduct that compromises trial fairness that will justify ordering a new trial,
    not merely improper conduct. Second, while not dispositive of the issue, the
    failure of defence counsel to object at trial is a relevant factor to consider.
    And finally, the reviewing court will look at the overall effect of the
    improper questions and conduct of the Crown in the context of the full
    cross-examination and the entire trial: <em>R. v. A.G.</em>, 2015 ONCA 159, at
    paras. 20-25.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the standard of review when assessing the Crown’s closing
    submissions, the issue is, <span style='line-height:200%'>whether the Crown’s
    closing remarks, caused a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice: </span><em>R.
    v. John</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>2016 ONCA 615</span><span style='line-height:200%'>.</span> Again, this
    will be examined <span style='line-height:200%'>in </span>the context of the
    entire trial and a new trial will only be ordered if the appellant’s right to a
    fair trial has been compromised: see <em>R. v. J.S.</em>, 2018 ONCA 39, at
    para. 38.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has repeatedly cautioned against improper cross-examinations and closing
    addresses by the Crown: <i>R. v. Henderson</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 628, at p.
    639; and <i>John</i>, at para. 77. More particularly, this court has identified
    the dangers associated with the cross-examinations of an accused person about
    the complainant’s attractiveness: see, for example, <i>R. v. F. (M.)</i>, 2009
    ONCA 617, at paras. 19-25; and <i>R. v. E. (F.E.)</i>, 2011 ONCA 783, at paras.
    68-69. Here, Crown counsel ignored these principles of law and pursued the
    otherwise irrelevant lines of questioning. In doing so the Crown came
    perilously close to causing this trial to be unfair.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    pursuing these lines of questioning, Crown counsel ought to have first vetted
    them with the trial judge, in the absence of the jury: see <i>E. (F.E.)</i>, at
    para. 70. He failed to do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    we do not accept the Crown’s submissions on appeal that the appellant’s
    perception of the complainant’s attractiveness, or his sex drive, were relevant
    to any issue at trial. In our view, both lines of inquiry were utterly
    irrelevant and carried with them the possibility of improper propensity
    reasoning by the jury. Indeed, Crown counsel at trial admitted as much in his
    closing address to the jury, acknowledging that these topics were really just
    fodder for undermining the appellant’s credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    despite these transgressions, no serious prejudice was occasioned mainly
    because the appellant acknowledged the sexual acts alleged by the complainant,
    but he claimed that they were consensual. Thus, while some of the
    cross-examination of the appellant by Crown counsel was improper, as were the
    related passages in his address to the jury, looked at in the context of the
    entire trial, these transgressions do not rise to the level of compromising
    trial fairness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the Crown’s contention that the appellant was controlling, we are
    not persuaded that this amounts to the improper use of demeanour evidence. On
    our review of the record, Crown counsel was asking the jury to consider the
    appellant’s response to questions when he testified and to use this when
    assessing his credibility. Crown counsel’s remarks were really about the
    appellant’s evasive answers, not his presentation when giving them. This is not
    the same thing as demeanour. There was no<span style='line-height:200%'> substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we observe that defence counsel did not object to the relevance or propriety of
    the questions posed by the Crown in cross-examination of the appellant: see <i>R.
    v. Middleton</i>, 2012 ONCA 523, at para. 58. Furthermore, neither defence
    counsel nor Crown counsel objected to the other’s closing address to the jury.
    Moreover, neither party sought any corrective instruction in the judge’s charge
    to the jury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b>The Trial Judge’s Charge</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    imperfections in the charge that the appellant urges upon us relate to factual
    matters (<i>i.e.</i>, the so-called toilet paper incident and the details
    surrounding the common assault charge that occurred at the home of the
    complainant’s parents). The trial judge clearly instructed the jury to make its
    own factual findings based on its collective view of the evidence. The jury is
    taken to have abided by these instructions. Accordingly, any minor imperfections
    in the trial judge’s account of the facts, such as there may have been, did not
    render the trial unfair.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons the appeal is dismissed.</p>
