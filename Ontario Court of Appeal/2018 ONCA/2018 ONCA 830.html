    appeals from his convictions for production of marijuana and possession of
    marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>He received a global custodial
    sentence of 15 months followed by 2 years’ probation, which is not the subject
    of this appeal.</span></p>

    appellant raises two other related grounds, at the heart of this appeal is
    whether inculpatory evidence seized by the police in admitted breach of the

line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:
200%'>. The appellant submits that once that evidence is excluded, the
    convictions are unreasonable and should be set aside, and that acquittals
    should have followed. In the alternative, the appellant asks for a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    that the impugned evidence should have been excluded from the appellant’s trial

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    arrest on the charges of which he was convicted followed three days of police
    surveillance. Working on an anonymous tip, the police carried out surveillance
    of a residential house in Bowmanville, Ontario, as a suspected marijuana grow operation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>During the
    surveillance, the police observed window coverings and condensation. They also
    noted a loud electrical humming noise and the smell of fresh marijuana coming
    from the house. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>On the third and
    last day of surveillance, the police noted that the appellant had spent over
    four and a half hours in the house. Upon the appellant’s departure from the
    house, the police stopped his vehicle a short distance away and arrested him
    for possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The arresting
    officer detected a “very, very pungent” smell of fresh marijuana emanating from
    the appellant and seized a water bill for the house from the appellant’s shirt
    pocket. She also seized three cellphones, $1,710 in cash, and a key ring with
    40 to 50 keys on it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The arresting
    officer immediately gave the appellant his rights to counsel and caution. However,
    on the direction of the officer in charge of the investigation, the appellant’s
    access to counsel was denied for over eight and a half hours until a search
    warrant of the house had been judicially authorized and completely executed by
    the police. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The police search
    revealed that the entire house was given over to the use of a sophisticated
    marijuana grow operation. The indicia of a large grow operation for sale and
    profit were apparent upon entering the house. The overpowering odour of
    marijuana and heat made the main floor quite uncomfortable. The basement served
    as the centre of the grow operation: divided into three areas, each area contained
    marijuana plants in different stages of growth; there were water and hydro
    bypasses; and numerous growing paraphernalia and plants were seized, including
    a growing and fertilizer schedule, 2,460 marijuana plants, 7 refrigeration
    units, shrouds, high intensity light bulbs, ballasts, electrical and timer
    panels, dehumidifiers, carbon dioxide generators, vent fans, and 4 garbage bags
    of marijuana shake which weighed 60 pounds. A ventilation system stretched from
    the basement to the attic. The mudroom was converted into an electrical room. Police
    seized 400 marijuana clone seedlings from the kitchen fridge on the main floor.
    The master bedroom served as a drying room with equipment and the washroom
    within the master bedroom contained significant marijuana growing equipment.
    The Crown’s expert estimated the potential street value of the marijuana
    produced at between 1.1 and 2.3 million dollars and the value of the equipment
    recovered at about $33,620.</span></p>

    arrested the appellant’s co-accused, Jiahao Li, who was found sleeping in a
    locked bedroom on the main floor of the house.</span></p>

    commenced on April 7, 2015. At the beginning of trial, the Crown conceded that
    the appellant’s </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:
200%'>Charter</span></em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'> rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10(b) had been breached. The appellant brought an
    application to stay the proceedings (which is not pursued on appeal). He also
    applied to exclude the evidence of the marijuana odour and of the water bill
    for the house seized incident to his arrest. The appellant also sought to
    exclude from his trial (but not on appeal) the evidence realized from the
    execution of the search warrant at the house. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>The parties had
    initially agreed that the appellant’s </span><em><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em><span

line-height:200%'>. However, towards the close of the Crown’s case on April 8,
    2015, the appellant requested a ruling on the </span><em><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'> application. The trial judge did not
    accede to the defence request because of his concern that the trial would be
    unduly delayed, Li was “not so keen” on waiving any delay, and a new Crown
    counsel would have to take over the prosecution. Counsel for Li advised that he
    would be testifying. </span></p>

    of the Crown’s case, on April 10, 2015, the appellant brought a motion for a
    directed verdict and expressed his concern about proceeding on the motion
    without a ruling on his </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:
200%'> application and without knowing what evidence, if any, would be excluded
    from his trial. The trial judge advised that the appellant should argue his motion
    as if the </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:200%'> application were denied and none of

    hearing the motion, the trial judge dismissed it, determining that the evidence
    of the appellant’s extended presence in the house and possession of the water
    bill provided sufficient evidence to support a reasonable inference of his
    knowledge of and control over the marijuana grow operation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    trial on April 10 and June 10, 2015. In his testimony, Li implicated the
    appellant in the grow operation. Specifically, Li testified that the appellant had
    hired him to work at his “legal plantation of marijuana” by taking care of the
    house, including snow shoveling and garbage disposal, as well as providing
    security against theft of the marijuana plants. Li testified that he saw the
    appellant go down to the basement on a number of occasions, including on the
    day of his arrest. Li also testified that on other occasions, the appellant
    would sometimes be accompanied by two others who also went with the appellant to
    the basement.</span></p>

    considering the appellant’s motion, the trial judge had to decide whether there

    the motion. A reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed, could return a
    verdict of guilty against the appellant on the basis of the evidence of the
    officers’ observations of the noise and smell of marijuana emanating from the
    house, the covered and condensed windows, and the appellant’s lengthy presence

    turning their mind to the specifics of the circumstances and concluding, on
    some reasonable basis, that police or public safety, or the need to preserve

    were concerned about officer and public safety, as well as the destruction of
    relevant evidence. Specifically, they said that if allowed to speak to counsel,
    the appellant might communicate with associates to set up booby traps within
    the house or set fire to the grow operation, or counsel, by advising potential
    sureties of the appellant’s arrest may inadvertently trigger the appellant’s
    associates to set those steps into motion. However, neither officer could point
    to any evidence that either concern could possibly materialize in this case. The
    officer in charge’s concern was entirely theoretical and based on her training
    alone; she admitted receiving no instructions or directions from senior
    officers. She testified that it was simply a matter of “common sense”. While
    the arresting officer had previously experienced booby traps on a couple of
    occasions, she admitted that her experience was unrelated to this case, dated, and
    from a different jurisdiction. She had never experienced booby traps during the
    execution of drug warrants in the jurisdiction where this case took place. There
    was no evidence that the arresting officer had shared this information with the

    right to counsel was justified to preserve evidence and to protect the safety
    of officers and the public. The officer in charge stated that they did nothing
    wrong and would do the same thing again in the same circumstances. As the
    officer in charge testified during her cross-examination:</span></p>

    the circumstances of this case. This is not a case where the delay in
    facilitating the appellant’s right to counsel was minimal and necessary and
    where no attempts were made to elicit incriminating information. The officers’

    appellant’s arrest, rights to counsel and caution, and his request to speak to
    counsel, the arresting officer attempted to elicit incriminating information from

    undermined all the interests it protects, regardless of whether the police
    succeeded in obtaining an incriminating statement from the appellant.  Those
    interests go well beyond the appellant’s fair trial rights as considered by the
    trial judge and include the vulnerability of an arrested accused who requires
    the immediate ability to consult with a lawyer to obtain counsel, not just for
