    decision arising from a custody and access appeal. The subjects of the appeal are
    three children: S, N, and A. The children were 17, 15 and 10 at the time the
    appeal decision was released. </span></p>

    this court was dismissed. The parties made written submissions on costs of the
    appeal to this court and the costs of a previous attempt to appeal to the
    Divisional Court. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    proceeding puts the costs issues in perspective.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>The father commenced
    this action in June 2013. In the course of the application, on consent of the
    parties, the court ordered a custody and access assessment under s. 30 of the </span><em><span
style='line-height:100%'>Children’s Law Reform Act</span></em><em><span
style='line-height:100%;font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em><span
style='line-height:100%'> </span></em><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.12. After the production of the initial assessment followed by an
    updated assessment, the application was placed on the trial list. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>For various reasons,
    the hearing of the application was delayed. When the father learned that it was
    unlikely the matter would be heard by June 2017, he brought a motion seeking
    sole interim custody of the children for 90 days (with no access to the mother
    during this period) and an order directing that during this period of interim
    custody, the parents and children participate in a program known as Family Bridges.
    In the alternative, the father sought an order for a directed trial on custody
    and access. In response, the mother brought a summary judgment motion seeking
    sole custody of the three children, with access to the father at the discretion
    of the children.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>In September 2017, the
    motion judge granted summary judgment in the mother’s favour. First, he
    dismissed the father’s motion in relation to S, because within a few weeks of
    the release of the decision, S would turn 18 and would no longer be within the
    court’s jurisdiction. The motion judge went on to give sole custody of N and A
    to the mother. He ordered that access and communication between the father and
    N would be at N’s discretion; access and communication between the father and A
    would be at A’s discretion in consultation with the mother. The motion judge
    awarded costs to the mother fixed in the amount of $80,636 plus HST.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>The father appealed the
    decision to the Divisional Court. The Divisional Court held that it did not
    have jurisdiction over the matter and transferred the appeal to this court, on
    an expedited basis. The costs of the attendance before the Divisional Court
    were “adjourned to the court hearing the appeal”: see </span><em>Mattina v.

    law cases in the Family Court of the Superior Court of Justice, in the Superior
    Court of Justice and in the Ontario Court of Justice. Although the </span><em>Family

    partially indemnify successful litigants; (2) to encourage settlement, and; (3)
    to discourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour by litigants: </span><em>Serra

style='line-height:100%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The father’s position is that each
    party should bear his and her own costs of the appeal. At most, argues the
    father, the mother should have her costs restricted to the actual attendance before
    this court, and on a reduced scale. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>In support, the father argues that
    the appeal concerned matters of the utmost importance. The father contends that
    he acted reasonably whereas the mother was uncooperative and took irresponsible
    positions and thereby delayed the proceedings. He submits that the mother
    contributed significantly to the high-conflict dynamic of this dispute. He
    submits that calling her “successful” would sanction such conduct and would be
    contrary to public policy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Finally, while acknowledging the
    current trend away from awarding no costs in custody and access cases, the
    father submits that the policy rationale underlying the historical approach
    best applies here. </span></p>

    the </span><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><span style='line-height:100%'> and
    r. 24 of the </span><em>Family Law Rules</em><span style='line-height:100%'>,
    submits that she should be awarded her full indemnity costs of this appeal. The
    mother relies on the parties’ motivations. Hers was the best interests of the
    children whereas the father’s was to win custody and/or access. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The mother submits that her
    lawyers charged reasonable rates and worked in a cost-effective manner. Based
    on the parties’ earlier Bills of Costs, the father had to have been aware that
    his lawyers’ services cost almost twice as much as the mother’s. It is
    reasonable to conclude that the mother’s Bill of Costs is within the range of
    costs the father would be ordered to pay if he were unsuccessful. The mother
    also points out that the father did not submit a Bill of Costs for services at
    the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

    father’s unreasonable behaviour increased costs dramatically. Among other
    things: </span></p>

style='line-height:100%'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The father submits that there
    should be no costs related to the parties’ preparation and attendance before
    the Divisional Court. The appeal routes in custody and access cases are not
    straightforward. He calls the costs incurred as they related to the Divisional
    Court appeal “an institutional loss” that should not attract cost consequences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Further, the mother should have
    raised jurisdictional concerns sooner. It would be unfair for the father to be
    penalized by a costs award because the motion judge at the Divisional Court
    made an error in assuming jurisdiction and the mother failed to take steps to
    remedy that error.</span></p>

    to full indemnity costs of the proceedings before the Divisional Court. The
    mother contends that it was unreasonable for the father to appeal, as the
    appeal had no merit. Second, the mother says that even if the appeal had merit,
    the father appealed to the wrong court. Instead of conceding the point, once
    the error was pointed out to him, the father held fast to his position, wasting
    time and money. </span></p>

    brought before the Divisional Court demonstrate his pattern of unreasonable
    behaviour throughout the appeal process. The father “lost” both motions but the

    mother. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span style='line-height:100%'>APPLICATION OF THE
    PRINCIPLES</span></b></p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The Costs before the Court of Appeal</h2>
  <h3>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother was successful on appeal and is entitled to costs</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father raised four distinct issues on appeal: the motion judge erred in
    proceeding by way of summary judgment, the motion judge erred in failing to
    attach sufficient weight to the s. 30 assessment, the motion judge erred by
    failing to consider the best interests of the children and the maximum contact
    principle, and finally, his s. 7 and s. 11(b) <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights
    were infringed: <em>Mattina v. Mattina</em><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span
style='line-height:100%;color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>,</span></i></span> at paras. 9-10. This court dismissed all four grounds of appeal. The mother is accordingly
    presumptively entitled to her costs. </p>
  <h3>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying the r. 24 framework suggests the mother should have 60-70% of
    her appeal costs indemnified </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is evidence of unreasonable conduct by the father in this appeal. It was
    unreasonable for him to continue on appeal to take the position that the only
    explanation for the rift with his children was parental alienation. Furthermore,
    the father continued to take an obstructionist approach to the litigation. For
    example, he insisted on relying on affidavits from motion materials used in the
    Divisional Court in violation of the parties’ consent order about the manner
    for filing further materials. The father had to have known that this conduct would
    increase the mother’s costs. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the mother’s conduct also impeded resolution. By way of example, we point
    to her refusing to schedule an expedited hearing before the Divisional Court
    and her refusing to allow the father to file additional appeal materials. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the time invested by each party, we note that a combined total of nearly 77
    hours by mother’s counsel was spent preparing for this appeal. A large portion
    of this preparation time appears to have been spent on the mother’s need to
    respond to the father’s motion to file an amended notice of appeal, fresh
    factum and further book of authorities. Although the mother was unsuccessful on
    that motion, we are of the view that it is reasonable for preparation time to
    be included in the mother’s cost award, given the father brought the motion
    with fewer than 36 hours’ notice, in violation of a consent court order, and
    that the mother’s counsel made a reasonable proposal that would have avoided
    the necessity for such a motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are persuaded by the mother’s submission that the father would have been aware
    of the fact that his lawyers’ services cost almost twice as much hers. The
    father would have also been aware of the high cost of litigation based on the
    motion judge’s costs order. It is reasonable to conclude that the father would
    have foreseen having to pay the mother’s costs and that these costs could be
    significant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the mother’s presumptive entitlement to costs has not been rebutted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    considered the reasonableness and proportionality of the relevant factors, in
    our view the mother should receive 60-70% of her costs. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The costs before the Divisional Court </h2>
  <h3>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Confusion surrounding family appeal routes</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has repeatedly commented on the fact that this province’s family law
    appeal routes are confusing for the public, counsel, and institutional
    litigants: <em>Christodoulou v. Christodoulou</em>, 2010 ONCA 93, 75 R.F.L. (6th)
    266; <em>Marchildon v. Beitz</em>, 2012 ONCA 668, 23 R.F.L. (7th) 316; <em>Priest
    v. Reilly</em>, 2018 ONCA 389. In particular, this court in <em>Christodoulou</em> noted the cost implications of this confusion at para. 35:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The inconsistency in current appeal routes can be confusing for
    the public, for counsel and for institutional litigants. It can also create an
    inequality in access to justice between litigants whose disputes at first
    instance are heard in provincial courts versus superior courts – the former
    must incur the costs and delays of two appeals in order to reach the Court of
    Appeal while the latter must incur the cost and delay of only one.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case illustrates once again the unnecessary costs parties bear as a result of this
    confusion. We therefore echo this court’s plea in <em>Priest v. Reilly</em><i> </i>(at
    para. 6): “It has been over eight years since MacPherson J.A. in <em>Christodoulou</em> specifically invited legislative reform in this area. This is a serious access
    to justice problem that must be remedied.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    this legislative deficiency, it would be unjust in our view for the father to
    pay the mother’s costs associated with the appeal before the Divisional Court. The
    father’s behaviour throughout this case is in our view sufficiently addressed by
    the costs awards for the remainder of the proceedings. </p>
  <h1>DISPOSITION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother seeks full recovery of her costs in the sum of $67,224.95. Of this sum,
    $25,887.50 is attributed to fees and disbursements associated with the
    Divisional Court appeal. This amount should be subtracted from the total amount
    claimed, leaving $41,377.45 for the mother’s fees and disbursements for the
    appeal before this court. In her Bill of Costs, the mother has included
    $1,914.95 for disbursements associated with the Divisional Court appeal, which
    were omitted in the Divisional Court Bill of Costs. This amount should be
    excluded leaving the mother with a Bill of Costs totalling $39,462.50. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the above analysis, it is reasonable in our view to award the mother 60-70%
    of her costs. We therefore order the father to pay the mother her costs fixed
    in the amount of $25,000. </p>
