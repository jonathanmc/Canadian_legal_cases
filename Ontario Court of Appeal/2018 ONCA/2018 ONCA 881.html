  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard: October 26, 2018</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on January 31,
    2014, by Justice Harvison Young of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    without a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had multiple assault convictions relating to “tricking”
    women into submitting to foot massages and then surreptitiously rubbing his
    penis on their feet. The convictions date back to April 2008 and March 2011. As
    a result of the 2011 convictions, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment
    plus probation, which included terms that he keep the peace and be of good
    behaviour, that he not touch any person’s feet without their consent, and that
    he not represent himself as either involved in, or having had, training for
    massage therapy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was released from prison on January 2, 2012. On that day
    he went to an apartment in Toronto where he stayed until January 12, 2012. He
    then went to a London residence until the morning of January 13, 2012. The
    trial judge found that while in both Toronto and London the appellant breached
    the terms of his probation by holding himself out as a massage therapy student
    and that in London, he unlawfully confined, assaulted, and threatened a nine
    year old girl, A.F., in the basement of her home and that he also sexually
    assaulted her by forcing her to rub her feet on his penis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals against his convictions on counts 6 to 12 of the
    indictment, being all but one of the London charges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises three issues on appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he argues that the trial judge erred by failing to adequately
    scrutinize the evidence of A.F. and give reasons for her acceptance of A.F.’s
    evidence. In this regard, the appellant asserts that there were multiple fabrications
    and implausibilities in the complainant's evidence and that the trial judge
    either failed to explain how she resolved them or resorted to speculation to do
    so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions. In our view, the trial judge
    recognized the problems with the complainant's evidence but also recognized
    that the complainant was nine at the time of the alleged events and eleven when
    she testified at trial. The child gave a police statement the day after the
    alleged events and had also testified at the preliminary inquiry. Not
    surprisingly, she was not able to provide a consistent chronology of how the
    events unfolded. The trial judge assessed the complainant as unsophisticated
    and noted that one of her teachers had described her as a struggling student,
    but the trial judge concluded she was a child who was trying to tell the truth. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly, although the trial judge found the complainant’s
    allegations that she was assaulted upstairs had not been established, she
    concluded that the complainant was unshaken in her core allegations about what
    happened in the basement, namely that the appellant blocked her from leaving
    the basement, grabbed her by the wrist and arm, forced her onto a mattress,
    threatened her and rubbed his penis against her feet. Notably, numerous
    complainants had described the appellant engaging in the latter behaviour. This
    provided powerful support for A.F.'s complaint of sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted there were other less reliable aspects of the
    complainant's testimony, however, she concluded that these frailties were
    explained by the passage of time, the child's focus on the frightening event
    that occurred, the child's nervousness and eventual fatigue while testifying,
    and the fact that many of the frailties were peripheral to the core event that
    happened in the basement. Although the trial judge did not resolve each and
    every inconsistency raised by the appellant, she was not required to. It was
    her job to weigh the evidence and assess whether the complainant's evidence was
    sufficiently reliable and credible to be relied upon. She explained that the
    child was unshaken in her central allegations and that a key aspect of those
    allegations was supported by powerful corroborative evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second, the appellant argues that the trial judge misused the similar
    fact evidence, using it to corroborate evidence that it contradicted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject this argument. As noted by the trial judge, in the absence of collusion
    or conspiracy, findings the appellant does not challenge on appeal, it was
    objectively impossible that A.F. could have described the sexual conduct in
    which the appellant had engaged if it had not occurred. In the trial judge’s
    view, the fact that the appellant had used trickery rather than force with the
    prior adult complainants did not detract from the weight of the similar fact
    evidence in supporting the complainant's evidence. The trial judge assessed the
    complainant as unshaken in her evidence of how the incident unfolded. She believed
    that the appellant resorted to force to get this young complainant to comply
    with his request.  That was her call to make. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended the defence evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument relates to defence evidence from two of the complainant's teachers
    concerning the timing of the complainant's disclosure to them. This evidence
    lacked sufficient force to detract from the complainant’s evidence. The trial
    judge treated it as such.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the able submissions of counsel, the conviction appeal is dismissed. The
    sentence appeal is dismissed as abandoned in accordance with the previously
    filed notice of abandonment.</p>
