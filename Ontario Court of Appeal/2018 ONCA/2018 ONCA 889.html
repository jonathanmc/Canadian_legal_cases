    the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 9, 2017, with reasons reported at
    2017 ONSC 3590.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Hourigan J.A.:</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mark Williams and Jake Richard were colleagues and friends. They
    regularly got together to drink beer after work. On the evening in issue, Mr.
    Williams consumed approximately 15 cans of beer over the course of about three
    hours while visiting with Mr. Richard at the home of Mr. Richard’s mother,
    Eileen Richard. A short time after leaving Ms. Richard’s residence, Mr.
    Williams loaded his children into his car and drove their babysitter home. On
    the way back to his residence, Mr. Williams was involved in a serious accident.
    He was killed and his children are alleged to have been injured.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This series of events spawned two court actions. In the first, Mr.
    Williams’ children and their mother sue for personal injuries allegedly
    sustained by the children. In the second, the children and their mother claim
    damages pursuant to the <em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3. Both
    actions are premised on a claim that the respondents breached a duty of care as
    social hosts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a motion for summary judgment, the motion judge dismissed both claims,
    finding that the requisite duty of care had not been established and that even
    if it were established, such a duty of care would have ended once Mr. Williams
    arrived home to pick up his children and their babysitter. In so finding, she
    relied primarily on two cases: <em>Childs v. Desormeaux</em>, 2006 SCC 18,
    [2006] 1 S.C.R. 643 and <em>John v. Flynn</em>, 54 O.R. (3d) 774 (C.A.), leave
    to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 394. These reasons explain why
    I have concluded that the motion judge’s order cannot stand. In its place, I
    would order that the cases proceed to trial.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The factual background to this appeal may be briefly described as
    follows.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Richard lived in his mother’s home, which was located approximately
    500 meters from the home Mr. Williams shared with his wife and three children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Williams and Mr. Richard worked together for approximately four
    years. They got together after work three to four times per week to drink beer
    at one or the other’s home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the day in issue, October 18, 2011, the men worked from 7 a.m. to 1
    p.m. Mr. Williams dropped Mr. Richard home after work. The pair had no plans to
    meet again later. However, Mr. Williams showed up at Ms. Richard’s home in his
    work van at approximately 4:30 p.m. that day.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Williams and Mr. Richard went to the garage and drank for about the
    next three hours. During that time, Mr. Williams is estimated to have consumed approximately
    15 cans of beer. There does not seem to be any debate that Mr. Williams was
    inebriated and that Mr. Richard knew Mr. Williams was in no condition to drive.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Mr. Richard became aware of Mr. Williams’ intention to drive the babysitter
    home in his personal vehicle and was aware that Mr. Williams would have his children
    in the car when he did so. The men had a pact that if either of them were going
    to drive while intoxicated and children were involved, the other would call the
    police. According to Mr. Richard, he threatened to call the police but he did
    not believe that Mr. Williams took that threat seriously. There is some evidence
    he received an assurance from Mr. Williams that he would not drive the
    babysitter home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is far from clear whether Mr. Richard was satisfied with Mr. Williams’
    assurance. His evidence regarding whether he believed that Mr. Williams was
    going to drive the babysitter was internally inconsistent. There was also
    inconsistent evidence regarding what Mr. Richard told his mother. Mr. Richard
    testified that he advised his mother that Mr. Williams was going to drive the
    babysitter home with the children in the car. Ms. Richard testified that she
    understood from the conversation with her son that Mr. Williams would not be
    driving the babysitter home.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond
    threatening to call the police, Mr. Richard did nothing further to stop Mr.
    Williams from driving while drunk. He did not call Mr. Williams’ wife or the babysitter
    to alert them to the situation. He did not ask his mother, who was not
    drinking, to drive the babysitter home. He did not walk to Mr. Williams’ home
    to see if his personal vehicle was in the driveway. It is also clear that Ms. Richard
    took no steps to prevent Mr. Williams from driving.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Mr. Richard, approximately ten minutes after Mr. Williams left, he accompanied
    his mother to a variety store in Otterville to buy cigarettes. He did so in
    part because he was worried that Mr. Williams might have driven the babysitter
    home. Mr. Richard admitted to being concerned about the situation before he
    left with his mother. His mother’s evidence was that they did not leave the
    house to go to the store until approximately a half hour after Mr. Williams
    left. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    driving to the Otterville store, Mr. Richard noted that Mr. Williams’ personal
    vehicle was not in his driveway. He went in the store and found that it did not
    have his mother’s brand of cigarettes. Upon leaving the store, Mr. Richard
    called the police from a payphone outside the store to alert them about a drunk
    driver. He and his mother then travelled to another store in Norwich to buy
    cigarettes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the way back from Norwich, Mr. Richard and his mother came upon the scene of
    Mr. Williams’ accident. He had driven into the rear of a stationary tractor
    towing a trailer. Mr. Williams was ejected from the vehicle and died as a
    result of his injuries.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:100%'>These actions were commenced naming various
    defendants. The only remaining defendants are Mr. Richard and Ms. Richard.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:100%'>The respondents brought a motion for summary judgment,
    asserting that they owed no duty of care to the appellants. The motion judge ruled
    in their favour.  She was of the view that the appellants had failed to
    establish the existence of any duty of care owed by Mr. Richard or Ms. Richard.
    In the alternative, she concluded, relying on <i>John</i>, that if a duty did
    exist, it was spent when Mr. Williams arrived safely home before departing
    again to drive the babysitter.</span></p>

    or ought to have known that Mr. Desormeaux, the social guest, was too drunk to

    driving: </span><em>Childs</em><i><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>,</span></i><span

    plaintiff had the onus of establishing </span><span style='line-height:100%;

    relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant that create a “special

    on social host liability, discussed below, demonstrates that there is no clear
    formula for determining whether a duty of care is owed by social hosts to third
    parties or guests. Rather, the determination of whether such a duty of care
    exists usually hinges on fact specific determinations pertaining to two main
    issues. The first issue is the host’s knowledge of a guest’s intoxication or
    future plans to engage in a potentially dangerous activity that subsequently
    causes harm. This is a foreseeability analysis. The second determination asks
    if “something more” is present on the facts of the case to create a positive
    duty to act. The “something more” could be facts that suggests the host was
    inviting the guest to an inherently risky environment or facts that suggest a
    paternalistic relationship exists between the parties. This is a proximity analysis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:100%'>The foreseeability case law has focused
    heavily on a social host’s knowledge as to the relevant guest’s level of
    intoxication, whether there were signs that the guest was intoxicated, and thus
    whether it was reasonably foreseeable that the guest would engage in certain
    acts and behaviours that subsequently led to an accident: see </span><em>Sidhu

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:100%'>In the context of summary judgment
    motions, some of the jurisprudence has suggested that the presence of
    conflicting evidence about the level of a host’s knowledge of a guest’s
    intoxication is enough to render a full trial necessary: see </span><em>Sidh</em><i><span
style='line-height:100%'>u</span></i><span style='line-height:100%'> at paras.
    40-41; </span><em>Wardak</em><span style='line-height:100%'>, at paras. 58-61; </span><em>Lutter</em><span
style='line-height:100%'>, at paras. 26, 29-30. In particular, cases that offer
    conflicting evidence on a host’s knowledge of a guest’s intoxication via
    affidavits may be particularly unsatisfactory; there could be a “significant
    risk of injustice” if such issues were not further explored in a full trial: </span><em>Lutter</em><span
style='line-height:100%'>, at para. 30. However, this does not mean that any
    ambiguity in the evidence on a host’s knowledge of a guest’s intoxication will
    result in summary judgment being denied. For example, in </span><em>Sabourin</em><i><span
style='line-height:100%'>, </span></i><span style='line-height:100%'>the motion
    judge found that even if the plaintiff’s evidence was taken at its highest,
    there was a lack of evidence that the host knew there was excessive drinking or
    that any guest was showing obvious signs of intoxication: para. 38. As such, there
    was a lack of reasonable foreseeability and summary judgment was granted.</span></p>

    that a positive duty to act may exist. While there is no definitive list, the
    case law has looked at a variety of factors to determine what could qualify as
    “something more” that would make a social gathering an inherent and obvious
    risk, including: whether alcohol was served at the party or whether guests were
    invited to bring their own alcohol, the size and type of the party, and whether
    other risky behaviour was occurring at the party, such as underage drinking or

style='line-height:100%'>, which was a “bring your own alcohol” party where the
    hosts provided minimal alcohol. Similarly, private parties of a reasonable size

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:100%'>With these principles in mind, I consider
    the analysis of duty of care in the present case. Normally, a duty of care
    analysis in the context of an allegation that a social host failed to act
    should consist of three elements. First, is the issue of whether the injury was
    reasonably foreseeable. Second, is the issue of whether there is sufficient
    proximity such that there is a duty to act. If these elements are satisfied, a </span><em>prima
    facie</em><span style='line-height:100%'> duty of care has been established and
    the third issue is whether <span style='color:black'>this duty is negated by
    other, broader policy considerations: see </span></span><em>Childs</em><span
style='line-height:100%;color:black'>, at paras. 12 and 31.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:100%;color:black'>The motion judge’s duty of
    care analysis, which is very brief, does not follow this structure. She indicated
    that the first issue was whether proximity had been established. However, she
    then proceeded to examine the issue of foreseeability as it related to Ms.
    Richard. At para. 48 she found, “there is no evidence that Eileen Richard knew
    that Mark was about to drive while impaired”. She concluded, therefore, that
    foreseeability had not been established. The motion judge then found at paras.
    49 and 51 that proximity had not been established in regard to Ms. Richard
    because none of the </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>features
    of a relationship that bring legal strangers into proximity, as cited by the
    Supreme Court in </span><em>Childs,</em><span style='line-height:100%'> <span
lang=EN-US>were present.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>With respect to Mr. Richard,
    the motion judge never made an explicit finding regarding foreseeability but observed
    at para. 54, “Jake obviously knew that Mark intended to drive the company van
    to his home approximately 5 minutes away.” She then stated, “the question
    becomes one of ‘proximity’.” Specifically, the motion judge said at para. 56
    that the issue to be determined is, “was Jake a social host, whom invited Mark
    into an inherently risky environment which he controlled or created”. Her
    analysis of that issue began with a quote from para. 42 of </span><em>Childs</em><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The first category concerns defendants who have created or
    invited others to participate in highly risky activities. Holding a house party
    where alcohol is served is not such an activity. Risks may ensue, to be sure,
    from what guests choose to do or not do at the party. But hosting a party is a
    far cry from inviting participation in a high-risk sport or taking people out
    on a boating party. A party where alcohol is served is a common occurrence, not
    one associated with unusual risks demanding special precautions. The second
    category of paternalistic relationships of supervision or control is equally
    inapplicable. Party hosts do not enjoy a paternalistic relationship with their
    guests, nor are their guests in a position of reduced autonomy that invites
    control. Finally, private social hosts are not acting in a public capacity and,
    hence, do not incur duties of a public nature.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>Then at para. 58 she stated, “accordingly,

    the motion judge’s reasons whether she turned her mind to the issue of
    foreseeability as it applied to Mr. Richard. In my view, there is enough
    conflicting evidence to suggest there is a genuine issue requiring a trial
    regarding whether it was reasonably foreseeable that Mr. Williams would drive
    home and then drive his children and their babysitter, while under the
    influence of alcohol.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:100%'>The next issue is the question of
    proximity as it applies to Mr. Richard. I am not satisfied that the motion
    judge’s analogy between the facts at hand and the facts of </span><em>Childs</em><span
style='line-height:100%'> is apt. The motion judge did not advert to or
    consider the obvious factual differences between the cases. This was not a
    large social gathering, rather it was two men drinking heavily in a garage.
    There was a developed pattern of this behaviour, enough so that the men had a pact
    as to what to do in the event one of them drove children while under the influence.
    Alcohol was provided or served, to a certain extent, as the garage refrigerator
    the men were accessing had 30 to 40 cans of beer in it. These facts distinguish
    the case at bar from </span><em>Childs</em><span style='line-height:100%'>.
    Moreover, nowhere in her analysis did the motion judge consider the statement
    in </span><em>Childs</em><i><span style='line-height:100%'>, </span></i><span
style='line-height:100%'>at para. 44<i>, </i>that “it <span style='color:black'>might

    a genuine issue requiring a trial regarding whether Mr. Richard, as a social
    host, may have invited Mr. Williams into an inherently risky environment that
    he controlled and created, thereby creating a positive duty of care.</span></p>

    relates to Ms. Richard, the motion judge was incorrect when she concluded that
    there was no evidence Ms. Richard knew that Mr. Williams would be driving while
    intoxicated. As described above, there was in fact conflicting evidence on the
    point. That evidence raises a genuine issue requiring a trial.</span></p>

style='line-height:100%'>After completing her duty of care analysis, the motion
    judge proffered an alternative reason for dismissing the claims. She stated
    that if she were incorrect on the issue of a duty of care, any such duty expired
    when Mr. Williams arrived safely at his home. In reaching that conclusion, she
    relied on a statement made by this court in </span><em>John </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>at para. 50</span></em><span style='line-height:100%'> as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>There is no duty of care on the part of Eaton Yale to members

    In that case, the individual defendant was an employee of the corporate defendant,
    working the overnight shift. The employee, who had previously sought assistance
    for his drinking problem through an employer supplied counseling program, drank
    steadily for eight hours before reporting for work, and consumed more alcohol
    during his breaks. The corporate defendant did not provide liquor to its

    and 50. The court noted that the employer did not provide the employee with
    alcohol and was unaware that the employee was intoxicated. Further, the
