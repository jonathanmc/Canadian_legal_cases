    C.C.L.I. (5th) 79.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>By the Court:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>These reasons, and the reasons in <em>Carroll v.
    McEwen</em>, 2018 ONCA 902<strong> </strong>released concurrently, address,
    among other issues, the intersection of tort damages and statutory accident
    benefits (&quot;SABs&quot;) under s. 267.8 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    I.8. This appeal concerns the deduction from the tort damages award of SABs paid
    before trial. The <em>Carroll</em> appeal concerns the assignment of future
    SABs to the tort liability insurer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both appeals require this court to determine how
    SABs are matched to tort damages for deduction and assignment purposes in
    accordance with the statute. Two different methods of matching SABs with tort
    awards, reflecting different interpretations of the statute, have developed in
    the case law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>One approach requires </span><span lang=EN-US>temporal
    and qualitative matching of SABs to heads of tort damages</span><span
lang=EN-US> (the so-called &quot;apples to apples&quot; or strict matching approach) and is
    based on this court&rsquo;s decision in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Bannon v. McNeely</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 659 </span><span lang=EN-US>(C.A.). </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Bannon</span></em><span lang=EN-US> involved an earlier and much
    different statutory scheme. The reasoning in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Bannon</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>was based on the decision of the British
    Columbia Court of Appeal in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Jang v. Jang</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> (1991), 54 B.C.L.R. (2d) 121 (C.A.). The authority of that decision
    was subsequently questioned by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Gurniak v.
    Nordquist</em>, 2003 SCC 59, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 652.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>More recently, a &quot;silo&quot; approach has been
    applied, which requires the tort award only to match generally with the broad
  corresponding SABs categories or silos.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This court&rsquo;s decision in </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Gilbert v. South</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, 2015 ONCA 712, 127
    O.R. (3d) 526 might be viewed as an application of the &quot;apples to apples&quot;
    approach in the assignment context, while this court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Basandra
    v. Sforza</em>, 2016 ONCA 251, 130 O.R. (3d) 466 is an example of the silo
    approach in the deduction context. </span><span lang=EN-US>This conflicting
    case law was most recently addressed by this court in </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Cobb v. Long Estate</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, 2017 ONCA 717, 416
    D.L.R. (4th) 222 and <em>El-Khodr v. Lackie</em>, 2017 ONCA 716, 416 D.L.R. (4th)

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <em>Carroll</em> appeal was initially heard
    by a panel of this court and was under reserve when this court released its
    decisions in <em>Cobb</em> and <em>El-Khodr</em>. The <em>Cadieux</em> appeal
    was scheduled to be heard in September 2017 when counsel for the respondent
    requested that a five-judge panel be constituted to determine whether this
    court&rsquo;s decisions in <em>Bannon </em>and <em>Gilbert</em>, remain good law in
    light of <em>Cobb</em> and <em>El-Khodr</em>. That necessarily raised the issue
    of whether <em>Cobb</em> and <em>El-Khodr</em> themselves were correctly
    decided.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <em>Cadieux</em> and <em>Carroll</em> appeals were heard together by a five-judge panel. The Ontario Trial Lawyers
    Association (&quot;OTLA&quot;) was granted leave to intervene on the interpretation and
    impact of ss. 224 and 267.8 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> on civil trials and
    the retrospectivity of the amendment to the <em>Insurance Act</em> with respect
    to prejudgment interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow in this case, and in <em>Carroll</em>, we affirm the silo approach to both deductibility and
    assignment of SABs set out at paras. 38-56 of <em>Cobb </em>and at paras. 33-72
    of <em>El-Khodr</em>. The silo approach is consistent with the statutory
    language of s. 267.8, is fair to plaintiffs, defendants and their insurers, and
    promotes efficiency in motor vehicle accident litigation. The decision of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Gurniak </em>questions the jurisprudential
    underpinnings of <em>Bannon</em>. In that light, and in view of subsequent
    changes to the <em>Insurance Act</em>, <em>Bannon</em> and<em> Gilbert</em> can
    no longer be regarded as binding authority in relation to the degree of &quot;matching&quot;
  required between tort damages and SABs for deduction and assignment purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>We begin with an overview of the relationship
    between SABs and tort damages, which sets the stage for the issues in both
    appeals.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ontario&rsquo;s automobile accident compensation
    scheme has two components. The first is based on mandatory automobile
    insurance, which provides &quot;no-fault&quot; first-party benefits (through SABs) to
    anyone injured in an automobile accident. The second component is a right to
    sue the &quot;at fault&quot; driver in a civil tort action, subject to certain statutory
    thresholds and deductibles, and a common law cap on non-pecuniary general
    damages: <em>Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy Alberta Ltd.</em>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229; <em>Thornton v. School District No. 57 (Prince George)</em>, [1978] 2 S.C.R.
    267; <em>Arnold v. Teno</em>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 287.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>SABs are the &quot;no-fault&quot; component of this scheme.
    They are available to anyone involved in a motor vehicle accident in Ontario,
    whether as driver, passenger, or pedestrian, and regardless of who was at
  fault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are three broad categories of SABs under
    the <em>Insurance Act</em> and the <em>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</em>,
    O. Reg. 34/10. These were referred to in <em>El-Khodr</em> as silos. The first
    category provides income replacement benefits or, if the person was not
    employed at the time of the accident, &quot;non-earner&quot; benefits, or &quot;caregiver
    benefits&quot;, if they provided caregiver services to another person at the time of
  the accident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second category is health care benefits. &quot;Health
    care&quot; is a defined term in s. 224(1) of the <em>Insurance Act</em>. It
    &quot;includes all goods and services for which payment is provided by the medical,
    rehabilitation and attendant care benefits provided for in the <em>Statutory
    Accident Benefits Schedule</em>.&quot; The <em>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule</em> sets out in detail the available health care benefits. Health care expenses
    include medical, rehabilitation and attendant care benefits, goods and services
    of a medical nature, rehabilitation expenses, and services provided by an
    attendant or by a long-term care facility, nursing home, home for the aged, or
    chronic care hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The third category of benefits addresses &quot;other pecuniary
    loss&quot;, which includes lost educational benefits, expenses of visitors, and
  housekeeping and home maintenance expenses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are limits on the quantum of SABs and time
    period for which some SABs can be claimed, depending on the nature of the
    claimant&rsquo;s injuries &mdash;  namely, whether they are classified as &quot;catastrophic
    impairment&quot;, &quot;non-catastrophic impairment&quot;, or within the &quot;minor injury
    guideline&quot;. SABs are available to claimants immediately after the accident and
  on an ongoing basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The tort component of compensation permits an
    injured person to pursue a civil action for damages against the person(s)
    responsible for the accident. Subject to statutory thresholds and deductibles,
    and a common law cap on general damages, the plaintiff may claim all pecuniary
    and non-pecuniary losses incurred as a result of the accident. These can
    include past and future loss of income, medical expenses, costs of care, costs
    of housekeeping and home maintenance expenses, as well as general damages for
    pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. In theory, an award of tort
    damages will put the injured plaintiff in the position that he or she would
    have been had the injury not occurred, so far as money can do.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>These two forms of compensation &mdash;  SABs and tort
    damages &mdash;  are independent of one another. It is inevitable, however, that there
    will be overlap between the compensation provided to an accident victim by
    no-fault SABs and the award of damages to that person in a civil tort action.
    Section 267.8 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> contains provisions designed to address
    this overlap and to prevent double recovery. It reflects the principle that victims
    should be fairly compensated, but not over-compensated. Automobile insurers,
    who provide first-party benefits through SABs insurance, should not be required,
    when wearing their fault based liability insurer hats, to compensate an accident
    victim twice for the same losses. In preventing double recovery, the statutory
    regime modifies the common law &quot;collateral source&quot; rule &mdash;  that insurance or
    other benefits available to the injured plaintiff do not reduce the amount for
    which the tortfeasor is liable: see <em>Boarelli v. Flannigan</em>, [1973] 3
    O.R. 69 (C.A.).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>We will discuss the application of these
    provisions below, but we note several key features of the legislation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, as a matter of statutory interpretation,
    ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6) require the deduction of SABs received prior to
    trial from damages received in a tort action on a silo basis. That is, SABs for
    income loss are to be deducted from the tort award for income loss (s. 267.8(1));
    SABs for health care expenses are to be deducted from the tort award for health
    care (s. 267.8(4)); and SABs for other pecuniary loss are to be deducted from
    the tort award for other pecuniary loss (s. 267.8(6)). There is no reasonable
    interpretation of the legislation, in our view, that permits either a more
    generalized approach to deduction (that is, a deduction of SABs in one silo
    from a jury award for damages falling within another silo) or a more
    particularized approach to deduction (that is, the deduction of particular SABs
    within a silo only from damages for the identical head of damage awarded by the
    jury within the same silo).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the deductions of SABs from the tort
    award are to be made taking into account the apportionment of damages to
    account for the plaintiff&rsquo;s contributory negligence under s. 3 of the <em>Negligence
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1 (s. 267.8(8)). In addition, the deductions of
    SABs as between defendants must be allocated to the defendants based on their
    respective shares of liability. We will discuss the application of these requirements
    in due course.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, SABs received after trial are to be held
    in trust by the plaintiff and paid to the tortfeasor(s) in the same proportion that
    they paid the tort damages awarded (s. 267.8(9) and (10)). Alternatively, the
    court may order that the plaintiff assign to the tortfeasor its right to future
    SABs. The application of these provisions is discussed in our reasons in the <em>Carroll</em> appeal.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In September 2006, Chad Cadieux (who was a plaintiff
    in this action and is a respondent/appellant by way of cross-appeal) and Eric
    Saywell (who was a defendant in this action and is the appellant/respondent by way
    of cross-appeal), both pedestrians, were involved in an altercation at or near
    the shoulder of a road. Saywell pushed Cadieux towards the road, causing him to
    stumble into the path of a truck driven by Susan Cloutier. Cadieux suffered
    brain damage and orthopaedic injuries. He became incapable of managing his own
    affairs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Cadieux claimed SABs from the no-fault benefits
    insurer, Aviva. He also commenced a civil action against Saywell and Cloutier.
    Prior to trial, he settled both his SABs claim and his tort claim against
    Cloutier.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The SABs settlement with Aviva was for a total

    (a) $300,000 for past and future income replacement benefits; (b) $250,000 for
    past and future medical benefits; and (c) $350,000 for past and future

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Most of the settlement funds were used to
    procure a structured settlement, which would provide Cadieux with a stream of
    payments over time. Some of the settlement funds were used to buy a house where
    Cadieux could reside with his father, who was his caregiver.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because Cadieux was incapable of managing his
    affairs, both settlements and applicable legal costs required and received
    approval by a judge of the Superior Court of Justice. The judge approved legal fees
    of $235,000 and disbursements of $30,999.36. The order did not allocate the fees
    and disbursements as between the SABs settlement and the tort settlement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Cadieux then proceeded with the tort action
    against Saywell for his several liability. There were offers and counter-offers
    of settlement, discussed below, but the action did not settle and it proceeded
    to trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>After a seven-week trial, the jury granted
    judgment in favour of Cadieux for $2,309,413. Although Cloutier was no longer a
    party, it was necessary for the jury to ascertain the degree of fault of each
    of Cadieux, Cloutier, and Saywell. The jury apportioned liability equally
    amongst the three: one-third against Cadieux in respect of his own contributory
    negligence, and one-third against each of Saywell and Cloutier. In principle
    then, subject to statutory deductions and the accounting for both pre-trial and
    post-trial SABs, Cadieux was entitled to recover from Saywell one-third of the damages
    awarded in the tort action.</span></p>

    the basis upon which deductions should be made, specifically, the extent of
    matching required when deducting SABs from the jury award. Should there be a
    strict matching of items in the jury award against the SABs benefits received,
    on an &quot;apples to apples&quot; basis, as Cadieux contended? Or, should the three
    different statutory categories of SABs (income replacement benefits, health
    benefits, and other pecuniary benefits) be regarded as silos, with deductions

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This issue arose because the jury made no award

    Brain Injury (&quot;ABI&quot;) support worker. The parties agreed, and the trial judge
    found, that the jury award for the ABI support worker was a
    medical/rehabilitation award and not an attendant care award. Relying on an
    &quot;apples to apples&quot; strict matching approach, Cadieux argued that this award
    should only be set off against the portion of the SABs settlement for medical
    and rehabilitation benefits ($250,000) and not the portion for attendant care ($350,000).
    The defence, on the other hand, advocated a silo approach, arguing that both
    the health care benefits and attendant care benefits were properly classified
    as being within the silo of health care and should be deducted from the jury&rsquo;s award
    for future costs of care, including the $701,809 in damages for the ABI support
    worker. The deduction would have had the effect of reducing the tort award for
  the ABI support worker to $101,809.</span></p>

    should be notionally apportioned equally between Saywell and Cloutier, with
    whom Cadieux had settled prior to trial, because the jury found them equally
    responsible for the accident. In other words, was the non-settling defendant,
    Saywell, entitled to set off the full amount of the SABs settlement against his
    portion of liability for the tort judgment, or was his set-off limited to 50
    percent of the SABs amount, having regard to Saywell&rsquo;s proportionate liability

    were a &quot;package deal&quot;, in that Cadieux could not accept one without the other.
    He concluded, at paras. 50-51, that it would unjustly enrich the non-settling
    defendant Saywell if he were entitled to deduct the full amount of the SABs
    from his one-third share of the damages. This would serve as a disincentive to
    pre-trial settlement. Equity and common sense supported allocation of the

    to deduct these legal costs unfairly penalized and potentially under-compensated
    Cadieux. He accepted Cadieux&rsquo;s apportionment of the legal fees between the SABs
    settlement and the tort settlement in proportion to their respective amounts.
    The proportionate share of fees and disbursements was deducted from the SABs

    loss in actions for personal injury such as motor vehicle accident cases. The
    effect of the amendment was to replace the fixed 5 percent rate with the
    variable &quot;prejudgment interest rate&quot;, defined in s. 127 of the <em>Courts of

    changes to the statutory regime, courts continued to apply the strict matching
    approach based on <em>Bannon</em>, in spite of that approach having been
    rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>Gurniak</em>. As we have noted, in the
    assignment of benefits context, courts have required a very strict matching of
    the tort damages to a specific SAB on a qualitative and temporal basis. The
    silo approach has recently prevailed in the deduction of benefits context. Under
    this approach, the damage award must only match generally with the
    corresponding broad SABs category.</span></p>

    discussed in <em>Cobb</em> and <em>El-Khodr</em>. Those appeals were heard

    the deductibility of SABs received by the plaintiff before trial under ss.
    267.8(1)-(8) of the <em>Insurance Act</em>. The <em>El-Khodr</em> appeal dealt
    with the trust and assignment provisions that apply to the plaintiff&rsquo;s receipt
    of SABs after judgment under ss. 267.8(9)-(12). Both appeals also raised the

    matching in the deduction of SABs from a jury award &mdash;  specifically, whether <span

    for past income loss could only be reduced by SABs for past income loss and the

    relate to past or future claims is irrelevant for the purpose of deductibility.
    Obviously, any amounts received before trial that include a sum for future
    income loss will, in all likelihood, be received by a plaintiff in settlement
    of his claims for income loss. Such payments are still payments received before
    trial for SABs in respect of income loss and are properly deductible from a

  <p class=CQuote>There is nothing in the language of the current Ontario

    the Supreme Court&rsquo;s explicit rejection in <em>Gurniak</em> of the matching

    neither this court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Gilbert</em>, nor the trial judge&rsquo;s decision
    in <em>El-Khodr</em>, referred to the legislative changes since <em>Bannon</em> or to <em>Gurniak</em>. She observed that, since <em>Basandra</em>, courts have
    moved towards a silo approach in the deduction of benefits context, based on the
    broad statutory categories, rather than strict matching. In her view, the same

  <p class=CQuote>The decision in <em>Gilbert</em> is anchored by the trial
    judge&rsquo;s factual determination that the jury award encompassed future care costs
    for which accident benefits would not be received and that the trial record did
    not provide a basis to reconcile the two. This likely explains why neither the
    trial judge nor this court considered the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in <em>Gurniak</em> and no comparison was drawn between the current legislative scheme and the
    legislative scheme that applied when <em>Bannon</em> was decided. As stated
    earlier, the differences in the legislation are significant and important.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, because she was able to factually
    distinguish <em>Gilbert</em>, (the respondent in <em>El-Khod</em>r was
    designated catastrophically impaired so no temporal limitation would apply and
    there were no benefits for which the assignment was requested that were not
    covered by SABs as in <em>Gilbert</em>) she concluded, at para. 37, that the
    specific question as to whether <em>Bannon</em> and <em>Gilbert</em> remain
    good law should be left for another day. Nevertheless, she reviewed the
    development of that law within the context of the legislative history discussed
    above and concluded, at para. 54, that the differences between those regimes
    and the current statutory scheme justified a different approach:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, the policy rationale supporting the strict matching
    requirement in <em>Bannon</em> no longer applies, given these amendments to the
    statutory scheme. The concern that the court had in <em>Bannon</em> regarding
    the uncertainty of future payment of SABs simply does not arise under the
    current legislation. Courts are no longer required to calculate the present
    value of the future benefits to which a plaintiff would be entitled and to
    deduct that amount from the damage onward. The potential unfairness of this
    requirement, in my view, was the overriding concern and the rationale that
    originally drove the strict approach to deductibility under the legislative
    regime that this court addressed in <em>Bannon</em>.</p>

    the &lsquo;silos&rsquo; created by s. 267.8 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> with the tort
    heads of damage.&quot; In her view, &quot;<em>Gurniak</em> puts into considerable doubt

    trial, we agree with MacFarland J.A. that the statutory language does not
    support matching at a more particular level than the three silos of income loss,
    health care expenses, and other pecuniary loss. For example, s. 267.8(4), which
    governs the deduction of health care expenses, provides that the plaintiff&rsquo;s
    damages for expenses &quot;that have been incurred or will be incurred for health
    care shall be reduced by &hellip; <span class=Underline>All payments</span> in respect
    of the incident that the plaintiff has received or that were available before

  expenses for health care&quot; (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bearing in mind the principle that the plaintiff
    should be entitled to full compensation for the loss incurred, but no more, a
    matching of the damage award to the corresponding silo does just that. Tort law
    compensates plaintiffs by an award of money. What the plaintiff does with the
    award is entirely up to him or her. For example, at trial, a plaintiff may
    claim damages for health care based on evidence of needs and costs for
    physiotherapy, psychological counselling, medication, and assistive devices and
    the jury may award damages on that basis. But once the award is paid, the
    plaintiff can do with the monetary award what he or she wishes. The plaintiff
    may use it for some or all of those purposes or for something completely
    different &mdash;  to buy a house, for example, as Cadieux did with the proceeds of his
    settlement. Deducting the SABs within the silo recognizes the plaintiff&rsquo;s
    autonomy to spend the damage award the way he or she wishes. The matching is
  fair and reasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The &quot;apples to apples&quot; strict matching approach unnecessarily
    complicates tort actions by focusing on immaterial distinctions or labels for
    heads of damages. It requires the trial judge to undertake what the Supreme
    Court in <em>Gurniak</em> referred to as a &quot;complicated and cumbersome process
    of &lsquo;matching&rsquo; a head of damage in tort to a particular claim for damages under
    a statutory scheme&quot;: at para. 45. Not requiring this type of &quot;apples to apples&quot;
    strict matching will have the benefit of simplicity and ease of application, an
  objective endorsed by the Supreme Court in <em>Gurniak</em>, at para. 45.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>It follows that we do not accept the
    intervener&rsquo;s submission that requiring plaintiffs to prove all expenses,
    whether covered by SABs or not, will make motor vehicle accident trials
    lengthier and more expensive. Plaintiffs should be required to claim at trial
    all damages arising from the accident, including expenses for which
    compensation has already been received through SABs or will in the future be paid
  through SABs. As MacFarland J.A. put it in <em>El-Khodr</em>, at paras. 84-85:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Future plaintiffs in motor vehicle accident cases should
    minimize trial courts' difficulty in matching damages and statutory benefits by
    presenting their claims according to the categories in s. 267.8 of the <em>Insurance
    Act</em>: they should make a claim for past and future income losses, a claim
    for past and future health care expenses; a claim for other past and future
    pecuniary losses that have SABs coverage; and a separate claim for any past and
    future pecuniary losses that lack SABs coverage. In cases involving
    non-catastrophic injuries, the presentation of the claim should account for the
    monetary limits and temporal limitations on benefits compensating for such
    injuries.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Plaintiffs should be required to present their cases in this
    way. They alone know best what amounts they have expended in relation to their
    injuries that their SABs insurer did not or will not reimburse. If those items
    are separately categorized, the matching difficulties disappear &mdash;  as does any
    risk of over or under-compensation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Claims should therefore be presented on a
    &quot;gross&quot; basis, rather than net of SABs. We see nothing unusual or complicated
    in this approach. It is done as a matter of course in other forms of litigation
    where a plaintiff brings suit for both insured (subrogated) and uninsured
    (unsubrogated) claims. It is also commonplace that plaintiffs in personal
    injury actions will provide proof of underlying goods and services that have
    already been consumed as a result of their injuries, in order to demonstrate
    the severity of their injuries and their ongoing need for such expenses. This
    information will be readily available to counsel, and proof of the expenditures
    should be uncontroversial. The SABs paid will be a matter of record and can be
  readily established.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>There is also no reason in principle why SABs paid to third parties,
    as a matter of convenience, should not be deducted from the award. The trial
    judge in <em>El-Khodr</em> made no distinction between SABs paid directly to
    the plaintiff and those paid to third party service providers in relation to
    the assignment of post-judgment SABs. She concluded that the plaintiff would be
    required to account to the defendants for post-trial SABs payments made
    directly to third party service providers. Otherwise, plaintiffs could avoid
    the trust and assignment provisions by requesting that their insurer pay third
    parties directly for services for which they recovered damages. The same
    rationale applies to SABs paid directly to service providers prior to trial.
    This result is consistent with the statutory requirement in ss. 267.8(1), (4),
    and (6) of deduction of amounts that the plaintiff &quot;has received <span

lang=EN-US>As we have noted, Cadieux settled prior to trial with both the SABs
    insurer, Aviva, and the truck driver, Cloutier. The issue is whether the non-settling
    defendant, Saywell, is entitled to set off the full amount of the SABs
    settlement against his share of the tort damages, or whether he can only deduct
    50 percent, in proportion to his share of the tort damages that were attributed

    damages are to be reduced by &quot;<span class=Underline>all payments</span>&quot; which
    the plaintiff has received for SABs. He also relies on s. 267.8(8), which
    provides that the &quot;reductions required by subsections (1), (4) and (6) shall be
    made after any apportionment of damages required by section 3 of the <em>Negligence

lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, we agree with the approach taken by the

    considerations of practicality, fairness, and common sense.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The principles of statutory interpretation are well known. The words
    of the statute are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the
    Act, and the intention of the enacting legislative body: <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo
    Shoes Ltd. (Re)</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21; <em>Agraira v. Canada
    (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</em>, 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R.
    559, at para. 64. Accordingly, it is important that the words &quot;the damages to
    which a plaintiff is entitled&quot; and &quot;all payments&quot; be considered within the
  context of s. 267.8 as a whole and with the purpose of this provision in mind.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In our view, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words &quot;the
    damages to which a plaintiff is entitled&quot; is clear. Subsections 267.8(1), (4),
    and (6) do not refer to &quot;net&quot; damages or even to damages &quot;payable&quot;. In our
    view, the words do no more than describe the effect of the deduction that is to
  be made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Such an interpretation is supported by the underlying purpose of s.
    267.8. As stated, s. 267.8 contains provisions that are designed to address the
    overlap between the tort damages and SABs to ensure that the plaintiff is
    fairly compensated but is not under or over-compensated. The various provisions
    of s. 267.8 prescribe an order of operations that applies to the calculation of
    the plaintiff&rsquo;s damages to ensure fair compensation. It does not make sense
    that the last defendant remaining in the action should be able to deduct all
    the SABs paid to the plaintiff. As the trial judge noted, this would discourage
    settlement, would under-compensate the plaintiff, and would unfairly enrich the
  non-settling defendant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Section 267.8 also incorporates the principle that the plaintiff&rsquo;s damages
    reflect the liability of all responsible parties involved in the incident. Subsection
    267.8(20), specifically provides that &quot;[f]or the purposes of subsections (1),
    (3), (4) and (6), the damages payable by a person who is a party to the action
    shall be determined <span class=Underline>as though all persons wholly or
    partially responsible for the damages were parties to the action</span> even
    though any of those persons is not actually a party&quot; (emphasis added). The
    purpose of this subsection is to ensure that the liability of a defendant, for
    the purpose of calculating its entitlement to deduct SABs from the judgment
    against it, is based on its proportionate liability, regardless of whether
    other defendants, protected or not, are parties to the proceeding and
    regardless of whether other defendants have settled with the plaintiff or on
    what basis. To construe the words &quot;damages to which a plaintiff is entitled&quot; as
    net several damages after apportionment between tortfeasors fails to give
    effect to that explicit direction by ignoring the settling defendant&rsquo;s proportionate
  responsibility for the loss.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Moreover, a contextual analysis of s. 267.8 as a whole supports the
    conclusion that the plain meaning of the words &quot;the damages to which the
    plaintiff is entitled&quot; in ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6) cannot reasonably be
  interpreted as referring to &quot;net damages payable&quot;.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We do not accept the appellant&rsquo;s submission that s. 267.8(8)
    requires apportionment as between defendants before the SABs deduction is made.
    In our view, the principle of statutory interpretation known as the presumption
    of implied exclusion (sometimes referred to as <em>expressio unius est exclusio
    alterius</em>) precludes such an approach. The principle of implied exclusion presumes
    that &quot;to express one thing is to exclude another&quot; and accordingly, when a statutory
    provision refers to a particular thing, but is silent with respect to other
    comparable things, that silence reflects an intention to exclude the unmentioned
    items: Ruth Sullivan, <em>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</em>, 6th
    ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada, 2014), at p. 248. In other words, &quot;legislative
    exclusion can be implied when an express reference is expected but absent:&quot; <em>University
    Health Network v. Ontario (Minister of Finance)</em> (2001), 151 O.A.C. 286 (C.A.),
    leave to appeal refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 23, at para. 32.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Subsection 267.8(8) specifically refers to apportionment <span
class=Underline>required by s. 3</span> of the <em>Negligence Act</em>, which
    deals only with the contributory negligence of plaintiffs. Subsection 267.8(8)
    does not address the apportionment of liability as between two tortfeasors and accordingly,
    it directs only that SABs are to be deducted from the plaintiff&rsquo;s damages,
  after those damages are reduced for any contributory negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>There is no specific language in any other subsection that expressly
    requires that the damages attributable to a non-party defendant be deducted
    before the SABs deductions required by ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6) are made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In our view, the legislature&rsquo;s specific inclusion of s. 267.8(8) is actually
    incompatible with the appellant&rsquo;s &quot;net damages payable&quot; argument. To interpret the
    words of ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6) as meaning net several damages payable after
    apportionment, as the appellant advocates, would require the apportionment
    exercise to implicitly take place under ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6). There would
    then have been no need to expressly direct apportionment for contributory
    negligence under s. 267.8(8). Such an interpretation would render s. 267.8(8) functionally
    meaningless. Because the legislature specifically directed that the damages to
    which a plaintiff is entitled are subject to reduction for any contributory
    negligence, the presumption of implied exclusion precludes any interpretation
    of ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6) that would require implicit apportionment as
  between defendants before the SABs deduction is applied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In addition, the principle of statutory interpretation known as the
    presumption of consistent expression precludes an interpretation of the words
    &quot;damages to which the plaintiff is <span class=Underline>entitled</span>&quot; in ss.
    267.8(1), (4), and (6) as meaning &quot;damages <span class=Underline>payable</span>&quot;.
    The presumption of consistent expression requires that when different words are
    used in separate provisions in a single piece of legislation, they must be understood
    to have different meanings: <em>Agraira</em>, at paras. 80-81. The words
    &quot;damages payable&quot; are explicitly used in s. 267.8(20). Because different words
    are used in ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6), the principle of consistent expression
    requires that these subsections be interpreted as meaning something other than
  net several damages actually payable by a party defendant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Finally, we reject the submission based on <em>McDonald v. Kwan</em>.
    That case dealt with successive accidents involving independent torts. The
    trial judge found that the first accident was the sole cause of the plaintiff&rsquo;s
    past and future loss of income. There was no income loss arising from the
    subsequent accident. In that case, the defendant whose negligence was the sole
  cause of the plaintiff&rsquo;s income loss, was entitled to deduct all the SABs. <em>McDonald</em> is clearly distinguishable on that basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In sum, we agree with the approach taken by the trial judge and with
    his conclusion that the result of this approach is fair. In our view, the order
    of operations mandated by s. 267.8 in respect of the two protected defendants in
    this case requires the following approach within each silo of SABs: (1) the
    damages attributable to Cadieux&rsquo;s contributory negligence are deducted from the
    damages awarded by the jury; (2) the total SABs paid and the settlement amounts
    attributed to that silo are deducted from the damages awarded by the jury; (3)
    responsibility for the payment of the remaining sum is then determined in
  accordance with the non-settling defendant Saywell&rsquo;s proportionate liability.</span></p>
  <h5>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>SABs should be deducted on a gross basis, not net of legal fees</h5>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree. The deduction of legal costs is inconsistent with the
    plain wording of ss. 267.8(1), (4), and (6) which provide that &quot;the damages to

    plaintiff has received &hellip; [in respect of SABs]&quot; (emphasis added). The statute

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, it may, in some cases, be appropriate

    the costs actually incurred by the plaintiff in recovering SABs which have
    reduced the amount of the tort award under s. 267.8.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>There are two strands in the jurisprudence from the Superior Court
    of Justice concerning this issue. One strand, exemplified by the approach taken
    by the trial judge in this case, is a &quot;net approach&quot; in which SABs deducted
    from the tort award are net of the legal costs incurred to obtain them. In
    adopting this approach, the trial judge referred to <em>Anand v. Belanger</em>,
    2010 ONSC 5356, 90 C.C.L.I. (4th) 138 and <em>Siddiqui v. Siddiqui</em>, 2015
    ONSC 6260, which followed <em>Anand</em>. See also: <em>Jones v. Hanley and</em> <em>Jones v. Livska</em>, 2018 ONSC 145, 22 C.P.C. (8th) 419. The underlying
    rationale of this approach, identified by Stinson J., at para. 32 of <em>Anand</em>,
    is that the tort liability insurer should bear the costs of the plaintiff&rsquo;s
    claim against the SABs, because it has received the benefit of the risk and expense
  incurred by the plaintiff in pursuing recovery of the SABs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>A second strand, illustrated by the decision of the Divisional Court
    in <em>Carr v. Modi</em>, 2016 ONSC 7255, 62 C.C.L.I. (5th) 295 (Div. Ct.), permits
    the plaintiff to recover legal fees and expenses incurred in recovering SABs as
    part of the costs of the tort action where appropriate, rather than accounting
    for these costs in the SABs deduction process in all cases. See also: <em>Ananthamoorthy
    v. Ellison</em>, 2013 ONSC 4510; <em>Hoang v. Vicentini</em>, 2014 ONSC 5893,

lang=EN-US>The rationale for this approach is similar to that expressed by
    Stinson J. in <em>Anand</em>, and was explained by D. Wilson J. in <em>Ananthamoorthy</em>,
    at paras. 21-22:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>&hellip; In cases where a Plaintiff claims for damages occasioned by a
    motor vehicle accident, there is a comprehensive scheme that provides for
    payment of accident benefits, including loss of income benefits, which includes
    procedures for dispute resolution that must be followed. However, the payment
    of these accident benefits is inextricably linked to the action against the
    driver because the defendant insurer can claim a deduction for amounts the
    Plaintiff receives from her own insurer. Thus, the solicitor for the Plaintiff
    is bound to pursue his client's entitlement to various benefits or face the
    argument at trial from the tort insurer that the Plaintiff could have and
    should have received benefits from the no-fault insurer.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>&hellip;&nbsp;In the case before me, it was the obligation of [plaintiff&rsquo;s
    counsel] to pursue the Plaintiff's entitlement to various benefits and this
    inured to the credit of the defendant tortfeasor. Had he not done so, it would
    have been exceedingly difficult to argue at trial that the Plaintiff was totally
    disabled from working as a result of the injuries from the accident when her
    own insurer denied payment of benefits based on inability to work. [Plaintiff&rsquo;s
    counsel] has taken off the sum that he received from the first party insurer,
  which is appropriate to avoid double recovery of fees.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In <em>Hoang</em>, decided a year later, D. Wilson J. qualified her
    observations, noting, at paras. 65-66 and 68-69, that the plaintiff&rsquo;s costs of
    pursuing the SABs claim should not be visited upon the tort defendant as a matter
  of course. Rather, this determination should be made on a case-by-case basis:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The issue of whether a tort defendant ought to pay some amount
    of costs that were incurred by Plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel for the pursuit of SABS is
    fact driven and depends on the particular circumstances of a case. The
    Regulations provide a comprehensive scheme for the recovery of benefits
    associated with motor vehicle accidents, and there are provisions for the
    payment of costs. There are different levels of procedure and adjudication
    available to applicants, including appeals. The pursuit of SABS and whether to
    settle or proceed to the next level is in the discretion of counsel and the
  injured party.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A Plaintiff has an obligation to apply for benefits, and if the
    request is rejected, there are different options that may be pursued. Tort
    defendants are not involved in the SABS process and have no ability to control
    it. It would be unfair as a general proposition, in my view, to lay the costs
    of the accident benefits pursuit at the feet of the tort defendants. <span
class=Underline>There may be times when a tort defendant derives a clear
    benefit from the accident benefits matters by way of a deduction of the amounts
    from damages, and in those circumstances a judge fixing costs in a tort action
    may consider it appropriate that the tort defendant pay the costs incurred by
    the Plaintiff in securing the benefits. At other times, however, there may be
    &quot;compelling circumstances</span>,&quot; as described in <em>Moodie v. Greenaway
    Estate</em>, [1997] O.J. No. 6525 (Ont. Ct. J., Gen. Div.), at para. 4, <span
class=Underline>where it would be inappropriate to visit the costs of dealing
    with other insurers on a Defendant in a tort claim. There is no hard and fast
    rule</span> (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=CQuote>As I stated in <em>Ananthamoorthy</em>, at para. 21, &quot;the
    solicitor for the Plaintiff is bound to pursue his client's entitlement to
    various benefits...&quot; There are limitations on that activity. The statutory
    scheme which exists for securing accident benefits provides for the payment of
    costs. In many if not the majority of cases where there is a tort action going
    forward, the pursuit of accident benefits is quite separate from the tort
    action, including separate disbursements and expert reports. It is appropriate
    in these circumstances that the solicitor for the Plaintiff accepts the costs
    as awarded at FSCO.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In other cases, depending on the facts, it may be appropriate
    for some of the time expended in pursing statutory benefits to be included in
    the fees sought in the tort action. I do not agree that a Plaintiff can take
    whatever steps he or she wishes to recover accident benefits and then demand
    and expect payment from the tortfeasors in a different proceeding.</p>

    contingent fee basis and, if so, the terms of the arrangement; and (h) the

lang=EN-US>There has been a change in the SABs arbitration procedure, effective
    April 1, 2016. Under the regime in effect at the time of the accident in this
    case (2006), s. 282 of the <em>Insurance Act</em> provided for arbitration of
    disputed SABs claim and s. 282(11) provided that the arbitrator could award a
    party the expenses of the arbitration. Arbitrations took place under the
    auspices of the Financial Services Commission (&quot;FSCO&quot;). A party was not
  required to arbitrate and could pursue a claim in the courts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Effective April 1, 2016, disputed SABs claims must be pursued in proceedings
    before the Licence Appeal Tribunal (&quot;LAT&quot;) and not in the courts. The LAT has
    no jurisdiction to award costs, except in cases where a party has acted
    unreasonably or the appeal is frivolous, vexatious, or commenced in bad faith,
    in which case the party may make a request for costs: <em>Common Rules of the
    License Appeal Tribunal, Animal Care Review Board, and Fire Safety Commission</em> (effective October 2, 2017), s. 19.1; see also <em>License Appeal Tribunal Act,
    1999</em>, S.O. 1999, c. 12, Sched. G, s. 8. The import is that in most cases,
    the party will bear its own costs of asserting a contested SABs claim against
    the insurer. The issue is not before us and we make no comment on the effect,
    if any, of the change in procedure on the recoverability of the costs of the SABs
    claim in the tort action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In the case at bar, because the trial judge adopted the net
    approach, he did not consider whether any portion of the expenses incurred in
    recovering SABs could be claimed as part of the costs of the tort action. There
    is nothing in the trial judge&rsquo;s reasons, nor in the record that is before us,
    that permits us to address that issue, having regard to the factors outlined
    above. Accordingly, we are unable to conclude whether it would be </span><span
lang=EN-US>appropriate in the particular factual circumstances of this case for
    some of the costs incurred </span><span lang=EN-US>in pursuing the SABs settlement
    to be included in the costs sought in the tort action if the parties are unable
    to resolve this issue. The question to be addressed in additional written
    submissions by the parties is: Whether, having regard to all of the
    circumstances,</span><span lang=EN-US> it is appropriate that the appellant pays
    some of the costs incurred by the respondent in recovery of the SABs, and if
    so, how much?</span></p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Management fee</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>It was agreed by counsel for the parties that the trial judge would
    fix an appropriate management fee for the administration of the damages awarded
    to Cadieux.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>A management fee ensures that the tort award is not prematurely exhausted
    due to the victim&rsquo;s inability to manage his or her affairs: <em>Townsend v.
    Kroppmans</em>, 2004 SCC 10, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 315, at para. 6. Here, Cadieux&rsquo;s affairs
    were being managed by his father, who was inexperienced in financial
  management.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Counsel provided the trial judge with case law concerning the quantum
    of a management fee. The trial judge settled on a fee equal to 5 percent of the
    assets under administration, which he described as a &quot;conventional award&quot;: see <em>Gordon
    v. Greig</em> (2007), 46 C.C.L.T. (3d) 212 (Ont. S.C.). He applied that
    percentage to the amount of the SABs settlement ($900,000) plus the net tort
    award after liability apportionment and, after deduction of the <em>FLA</em> portion, arrived at a management fee of $65,250.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant Saywell asserts that: (a) it was a legal error to
    award a management fee when, based on the evidence, the jury had already made
    an award of $31,380 for bookkeeping expenses; (b) the funds were in a
    structured settlement and required no management (relying on the decision of
    this court in <em>Wilson v. Martinello</em> (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), at
    p. 422); and (c) the trial judge erred in calculating the management fee based on
    100 percent of the SABs settlement when he had found that Saywell was only
    entitled to deduct 50 percent of the SABs amount from his share of damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The determination of whether a management fee is appropriate, and
    the amount of the fee, are questions of fact to be made on a case-by-case
    basis: see <em>Mendzuk v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia</em>,
    [1988] 2 S.C.R. 650.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The parties were clearly satisfied that there was sufficient
    evidence and authority before the trial judge to establish that a management
    fee was appropriate and to enable him to fix a fair and reasonable management
    fee. Having entrusted the issue to the court, the appellant can hardly complain
    that the trial judge found it appropriate to make some award for asset
    management. There was no dispute that Cadieux was incapable of managing his
    affairs and there was no clear overlap with the bookkeeping award, which
    appears to have been for banking and other personal financial affairs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>However, while the amount of the award is reasonable, the appellant
    has identified an error in principle in calculating the award on the basis of
    100 percent of the SABs settlement and net tort award, when he was only entitled
    to deduct 50 percent of the SABs amount. We would therefore allow the appeal to
    that extent.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant re-asserts the submission he made at trial that while
    the entitlement to prejudgment interest in s. 128(1) is a substantive right,
    the amendment to the <em>Insurance Act</em> regarding the applicable prejudgment
    interest rate speaks only to the method of calculation of interest and is
    simply procedural and therefore has retrospective operation. The respondent
    plaintiffs, supported by the OTLA, take the position that the right to
    prejudgment interest is substantive and vests at the moment of the accident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The issue was comprehensively addressed by MacFarland J.A. in <em>Cobb</em>,
    at paras. 66-104. She concluded that as a matter of statutory interpretation
    the <em>Insurance Act</em> amendment was intended to apply to actions such as
    this, commenced before the legislation came into effect but tried after. Her
    conclusions were adopted in <em>El-Khodr</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span
lang=EN-US>We respectfully agree with her conclusion on this issue and endorse
    her reasons. We therefore allow the appeal with respect to this issue. The
    default rate prescribed by s. 128 will therefore apply unless it is appropriate
    for the court to reduce or increase the prescribed rate of interest or to
    disallow interest otherwise payable under s. 128. As the trial judge made no
    findings that would permit us to exercise that discretion, we are unable to
    conclude whether it would be&nbsp;appropriate to do so in this case. The
    parties may address that issue by further written submissions.&nbsp;The question
    to be addressed is whether, having regard to all the circumstances, it is
    appropriate that the court exercise discretion under s. 130 of the <em>Courts
    of Justice Act</em> to award prejudgment interest at a rate other than the
    default rate prescribed by s. 128.</span></p>
