  <p class=Heard>Heard: October 4, 2018</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on March 11, 2016,
    by Justice K. Barnes of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Lauwers J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted of six counts of
    fraud over $5,000 (three counts against Deborah Lo, two counts against Glenford
    Jones, the appellant’s half-brother, and one count against Scotiabank), one
    count of uttering a forged document (an IBM invoice) and one count of
    personation (for impersonating Mr. Jones). He was sentenced to four years in
    jail, restitution and a fine in lieu of forfeiture. The total loss was just
    over $600,000. He appeals his conviction and seeks a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant raises two grounds of appeal:
    First, the trial judge erred in admitting the hearsay evidence of the
    Scotiabank account manager, Dean Karahojitis, at the trial under s. 715(1) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em><i>, </i>because doing so was fundamentally unfair to
    the appellant’s right to full answer and defence. Second, the trial judge
    failed to relate the large volume of oral<i> </i>and documentary evidence to
    the individual counts in his jury charge. I address each issue after setting
    out the factual background. I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Factual Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was a financial advisor. He
    controlled a number of financial companies, including Laers Inc., Laers LPC,
    and 1590 Group Inc. He was alleged to have defrauded two clients: his friend
    Deborah Lo and his half-brother Glenford Jones. Ms. Lo lost $350,000 in what
    the appellant portrayed as an investment in Gametronics gone bad. The jury
    found that it was a fraud. Mr. Jones lost $11,826.73 because the appellant
    cashed in his RRSP and took the money. He also lost $35,340 on his investment
    in Gametronics. Convictions for these frauds are not seriously challenged by
    the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The heart of this appeal is the Scotiabank
    fraud. The appellant was alleged to have personated Mr. Jones and used a
    fraudulent IBM invoice and other documentation in order to obtain from
    Scotiabank $250,000 advanced as a loan and line of credit, to be used in part
    to finance the acquisition of an IBM computer server (the “Laers loan”). The
    substantiating documents included insurance, an invoice for the purchase of the
    IBM server, and the unaudited financial statements of Laers Inc. The documents,
    all fakes, were provided to Mr. Karahojitis by “Jones”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Karahojitis testified at the appellant’s
    preliminary inquiry but died before trial. He testified that he met “Jones”
    before the loan was made. He also testified that he and his superior Wayne
    Ellis met with “Jones” in August 2005 after the Laers loan was in arrears, when
    “Jones” showed him evidence of assets of over $400,000 with TD Bank. Mr.
    Karahojitis identified the appellant’s Ministry of Transportation (“MTO”)
    picture as being that of Mr. Jones, but did not recognize Mr. Jones’ actual MTO
    picture. This testimony supported the Crown’s theory that the appellant was
    personating Mr. Jones in order to secure the loan from Scotiabank. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Karahojitis testified that he did his due
    diligence by inspecting the server at Mr. Jones’ business address, by
    contacting IBM and verifying the transaction, and by investigating Laers Inc.’s
    financial statements that were purportedly prepared by “Val Purushothaman,
    Chartered Accountant”. However, Mr. Purushothaman denied preparing these
    statements. IBM’s head of investigation denied that Mr. Karahojitis spoke to
    IBM about the server; there was no such server to be inspected. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Karahojitis also admitted he improperly kept
    client files at home. Among the items found at his home was the second
    fraudulent IBM invoice. It was contained in the documents disclosed by the
    Crown before the preliminary inquiry. It was located at Tab 18 of the Crown’s
    disclosure book and labeled as “Documents found from Dean Karahojitis’
    residence.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> Mr. Karahojitis was not questioned about the second fraudulent IBM invoice,
    although defence counsel cross-examined him extensively and impeached his testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second IBM invoice, which was not referred
    to at the preliminary inquiry, assumed some importance at trial. The fact that
    Mr. Karahojitis was no longer available to be cross-examined on this document 
    was raised by trial defence counsel (who was not counsel at the preliminary
    inquiry) three times: in a pre-trial motion, during the trial, and in an
    application for a mistrial. This leads to the first issue.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Issue One: Did the trial judge err in admitting Mr. Karahojitis’
    hearsay evidence at the trial under s. 715(1) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><i><span
lang=EN-US>?</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Karahojitis died before trial. The Crown was
    obliged to bring a pre-trial motion to admit his preliminary inquiry testimony
    under s. 715(1) of the </span><em>Criminal Code </em><span lang=EN-US>in order
    to use his evidence in the appellant’s prosecution. The defence agreed that the
    testimony met the statutory pre-conditions in s. 715(1), but argued that the
    judge should refuse to admit the testimony using his residual discretion,
    because the admission of the testimony would undermine trial fairness.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The governing principles regarding both the
    application of s. 715 of the Code and the application of the trial judge’s
    residual discretion were canvassed extensively by Watt J.A., in </span><em>R.
    v. Saleh</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2013 ONCA 742, 303 C.C.C. (3d) 431, and by
    Brown J.A. in </span><em>R. v. Jones-Solomon</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2015 ONCA
    654, 329 C.C.C. (3d) 191.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Watt J.A. noted in </span><em>Saleh</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 77-78, that among the factors to be considered by the
    trial judge in the exercise of the residual discretion to exclude evidence
    admissible under s. 715 (1) are “the crucial nature of the evidence itself” and
    “the crucial nature of the credibility of the witness whose evidence is
    tendered for admission”. He added that the circumstances in which the evidence
    may be excluded “are comparatively rare”. The appellant argues that this is one
    such rare case.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Pre-Trial Motion </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial defence counsel raised the issue of the
    second fraudulent IBM invoice in his argument opposing the admission of Mr.
    Karahojitis’ testimony at trial under s. 715(1) of the Code. If the invoice
    really did come from Mr. Karahojitis’ home, then it could have been used to
    impeach him in two ways. First, the invoice was addressed to 1590 Group Inc.
    (one of Mr. Headley’s companies), potentially contradicting Mr. Karahojitis’
    testimony that he had no knowledge of this company. Second, there was no
    apparent reason why Mr. Karahojitis should have had this second fraudulent
    invoice in his possession unless he was complicit in the fraud. The defence
    theory was that Mr. Karahojitis actually met with the real Mr. Jones and that
    the two of them worked together to defraud Scotiabank.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Crown counsel was not prepared to admit that the
    second IBM invoice was found at Mr. Karahojitis’ residence until this was
    confirmed by the investigating officer. However, Crown counsel said he was
    satisfied that the invoice was in the Crown disclosure and had come from Mr.
    Ellis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Defence counsel expressed the view that second
    IBM invoice had been found in Mr. Karahojitis’ residence, but said he was
    “content” with the Crown’s answer. Defence counsel also stated his view that it
    “would be getting closer to fairness” if the judge gave a jury instruction that
    the defence had not had an opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Karahojitis on this
    document and combined this with a<i> </i></span><em>Vetrovec</em><span
lang=EN-US> warning.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge granted the Crown’s application
    to admit Mr. Karahojitis’ preliminary inquiry testimony at trial under s.
    715(1) of the Code, and said he would give reasons in writing at a later date.
    He stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I am not going to
    write my reasons because I haven’t had a chance to do that. I am going to,
    these are not my reasons but just to give you an idea of the ballpark. I am
    going to permit, I am going to grant the Crown's application and the
    expectations that the jury receive the usual instructions and I’ll set it out
    as we discussed. And if the evidence comes out the way in which the defence has
    said it's going to come out I am inclined to give a </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Vetrovec</span></em><span lang=EN-US> with respect to
    him, all right. So I am inclined to give a </span><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>Vetrovec</span></em><span lang=EN-US> with respect to him and that
    forms an important component of my reasons. So at least you have an idea of the
    parameters with respect to that. That will allow us to be able to start the
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s written reasons arrived
    shortly before the argument of the appeal but this court did not consider them,
    nor did counsel refer to them in oral argument.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Trial </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Partway through the Crown’s case, on February
    11, 2016, defence counsel again raised the issue of the second IBM invoice.
    Crown counsel repeated that he did not know where it had been found. Defence
    counsel pointed out that Tab 18 was labeled “Documents found from Dean
    Karahojitis’ residence” and asked the Crown to make further inquiries. Crown
    counsel said he had already done so and would again, but reiterated that he thought
    the documents had come from Mr. Ellis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence then called Mr. Ellis, who was
    cross-examined by the defence as a hostile witness. He testified that Mr.
    Karahojitis was fired for violating bank policies and poor performance. Mr.
    Ellis agreed that he had a meeting with “Jones” and Mr. Karahojitis after the
    Laers loan went into arrears. He identified the appellant as “Jones” and did
    not recognize Mr. Jones’ genuine MTO photograph. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defence also called Mr. Karahojitis’ ex-wife
    Ms. Skordakis. She testified that she returned a large quantity of bank
    documents to Mr. Ellis from Mr. Karahojitis’ home shortly after he died. Inside
    one of those boxes was the second IBM invoice, an application for banking
    services completed by the appellant, and multiple pieces of the appellant’s ID.
    The defence called both Mr. Ellis and Ms. Skordakis to prove where the key
    documents came from, but neither recalled having seen these documents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 23, 2016, during the defence’s case,
    defence counsel raised the second IBM invoice again and said he would bring a
    motion to stay the Scotiabank charges. After receiving a copy of the index for
    Tab 18 of the Crown disclosure from the defence, the Crown finally conceded
    that the documents had in fact been retrieved from Mr. Karahojitis’ home. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Mistrial Application</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The next day the defence applied for a mistrial,
    and/or a stay, and to reopen the s. 715(1) application. Defence counsel argued
    that the Crown’s concession contradicted and nullified Mr. Karahojitis’
    preliminary inquiry testimony. He also asserted that had the Crown not required
    the defence to establish continuity of possession of the second invoice, he

    He stated that he was not satisfied that the timing of the revelation of the

    the appellant’s ability to make a full answer and defence. The trial judge
    considered that a strong </span><em>Vetrovec</em><span lang=EN-US> warning

    found in Mr. Karahojitis’ residence in the </span><em>Vetrovec</em><span

    would not have called Mr. Ellis to testify if the Crown had admitted that the
    second invoice came from Mr. Karahojitis’ residence. This is because the
    defence had a problem with Mr. Ellis’ evidence: although Mr. Ellis could
    establish the continuity of the second IBM fraudulent invoice linking Mr.
    Karahojitis to the fraud, he could also provide what the appellant describes as
    “harmful evidence—identifying the Appellant as “Glenford Jones” and denying
    that he knew the Appellant or met him and Jones together.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, this is hindsight reasoning. The trial
    judge rejected this assertion in argument on the mistrial application. He found
    that the defence would have called Mr. Ellis in any event, because: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[T]here’s
    overwhelming evidence that the primary reason for calling Wayne Ellis was to
    show that he was a corrupt banker in cahoots with Dean [Karahojitis]. That was
    the primary reason. And if anything, this concession makes your case in terms
    of making that point even stronger than it did before Wayne Ellis, than at the
    end of the case. Right? So, you know, I am having difficulty understanding how
    that point puts you in an inability to make full answer and defence. </span></p>

    by the defence as new evidence, it was in the Crown disclosure from the outset.
    It is not known why preliminary inquiry defence counsel either did not notice
    the document, or decided not to cross-examine Mr. Karahojitis on it. Trial
    defence counsel was left to make the best of it. </span></p>

    in allowing the Crown’s s. 715(1) pre-trial application, and in rejecting the
    defence applications for a mistrial, and/or a stay, and to reopen the s. 715(1)

    standard of review is adequacy, not perfection. An appellate court's approach
    is &quot;functional&quot;. It assesses the adequacy of the charge in the light
    of its purpose. Even if a trial judge strays from the ideal, the fundamental
    question an appellate court must ask is: has the jury been &quot;left with a
    sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to the relevant
    issues&quot;… Or, are we satisfied &quot;that the jurors would adequately
    understand the issues involved, the law relating to the charge the accused is
    facing, and the evidence they should consider in resolving the issues&quot;… If
    the answer to either question is &quot;yes&quot;, then the charge will be

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The role of the

    verdict.” He said, at para. 175: “A crucial constituent of this scheme…
    involves linking the critical features of the evidence to the issue or
    essential element to which the evidence relates.” He added: “Said somewhat
    differently, what must be proven (the essential element) is mated with what is
    offered to prove it (the evidence).”</span></p>

    transcript and took about four and a half hours over two days to deliver.
    Consistent with best practice, the trial judge gave counsel a draft of the
    charge and took submissions on the text. Counsel did not object to the
    structure or content of the charge, a copy of which was provided to the jury.
    The trial judge also amended the written charge during the breaks in response
    to comments from counsel as he proceeded through it. </span></p>

    sections, apart from the standard first section generally describing the jury’s
    duties. He conducted a lengthy review of the evidence witness-by-witness without
    relating the evidence to the counts. Next, he read out each of the counts,
    explained the legal elements which the Crown was obliged to prove, and
    mentioned briefly the individuals involved, but without linking the related
    evidence in any detail. He ended with a review of the positions of the parties. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the text of the jury charge, the defence
    position was organized on a count-by-count basis and did make detailed links to
    the evidence. The Crown position was organized not by counts but by victim,
    with a section for each of Ms. Lo, Mr. Jones, and Scotiabank. The links between
    each of the counts and the related evidence was carefully laid out.</span></p>

    The appellant points out that the trial judge ended his review of the essential
    elements with a boilerplate paragraph:  “This same passage—</span><em>word-for-word</em><span

    recitation”. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, such repetition is neither
    necessary nor helpful to the jury. Nor does it serve to appeal-proof a jury
    charge. This charge is far from a model to be followed in other case. But that
    does not mean it was inadequate. The adequacy of a charge is to be assessed on
    a case-specific basis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, despite the infirmities in the

    evidence to the issues from the perspectives of both the Crown and the defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, contrary to the submissions of the
    appellant, the fraud charges were not complex. They were relatively simple and
    were not particularized in a confusing manner. While there was voluminous
    evidence, there were really only three credibility contests before the jury:
    the first was between the appellant and Ms. Lo; the second was between the
    appellant and Mr. Jones; and the third was between Mr. Headley on the one hand,
    and the witnesses he implicated in the Scotiabank fraud, Mr. Karahojitis, Mr.
    Ellis and Mr. Jones. The evidence relating to each of these opposed pairs was
    relatively simple. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, while the trial judge’s treatment of the
    elements of each count was laborious, the fraud at the core and the credibility
    of the witnesses related to each count, would not have been lost on the jury. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the charge must be read as a whole. On
    balance, it did communicate the legal framework. A witness-by-witness
    recitation or summary of the evidence, without explaining how the significant
    parts of the evidence relate to the particular issues in the case has been
    criticized by this court as generally ineffective and unhelpful: see e.g. <i>Newton</i>,
    at paras. 15-19; <i>R</i></span><em>. v. Dieckmann</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2017
    ONCA 575, 355 C.C.C. (3d) 216, at para. 41. In this case, however, the trial judge’s
    approach of summarizing the evidence witness-by-witness did no harm. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Take, for example, the Scotiabank fraud, to
    which the bulk of the appellant’s arguments were addressed. The Crown’s key
    witness was Mr. Karahojitis; his preliminary inquiry evidence was extensively
    treated by the trial judge and by the parties in their jury addresses.
    Moreover, their positions were well laid out in the jury charge in digestible
    form. The very nature of the Scotiabank count was to link it with the evidence
    of Mr. Karahojitis, Mr. Ellis and Mr. Jones as against the appellant’s
    testimony. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, the instruction was fair and represented

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Did the jury have before it an understanding of
    the law and the evidence necessary to make the credibility determinations
    necessary in this case? In my view, it did. The lack of objection to the jury
    charge in draft, or after it was delivered, is indicative that trial counsel
    had the same sense. In this case, the lack of an objection is material: see </span><em>R.
