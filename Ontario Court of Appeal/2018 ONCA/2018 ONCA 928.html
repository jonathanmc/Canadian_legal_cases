  <p class=Heard>Heard: September 14, 2018</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on March 3, 2016 by
    Justice J. McCarthy of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge>Then J. (<em>ad hoc</em>):</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Megan Bacci (“the appellant”) appeals her convictions on two counts of
    impaired operation causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the <em>Criminal
    Code </em>R.S.C. 1995, c. C-46, as am., two counts of driving over 80 causing bodily
    harm contrary to s. 255(2.1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, and two counts of
    dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. These convictions relate to the injuries suffered by two female
    passengers when the motor vehicle driven by the appellant overturned after the
    appellant  failed to negotiate a curve and had left the roadway.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in his initial charge
    to the jury in formulating the direction suggested by the Supreme Court in <em>R.
    v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 with respect to the statement made by the
    appellant purporting to explain the cause of the crash. The appellant also
    submits that the trial judge not only failed in his recharge to correct his
    initial error, but also made further substantial errors that necessitate a new
    trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellant that the convictions on all counts must be
    quashed and a new trial ordered, with respect to errors in the manner in which
    the trial judge dealt with the direction suggested in <em>W.(D.)</em> in the
    recharge.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Background Facts</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As there is to be a new trial it will only be necessary to briefly
    outline those facts pertinent to an understanding of the ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the long weekend of May in 2012, the appellant and four girlfriends
    attended at her family cottage. On May 19, a designated driver drove them to
    Wasaga Beach, where they visited a local bar for part of the afternoon. On
    their return to the appellant’s cottage, they had dinner and decided to go out
    for the evening. The crash occurred shortly after 8:00 p.m. as the appellant
    drove her four friends back to Wasaga Beach for the evening.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alexandra Jones witnessed the accident which resulted in the appellant’s
    charges. She testified that at the time of the crash it was still light
    outside, it was clear and dry and that the road was paved. She observed a beige
    car travelling southbound towards her swerve across the dividing line into her
    lane, causing her to pull off the roadway in order to avoid a collision with
    the beige car. Ms. Jones heard a screeching sound and observed that the beige
    car had left the road and had flipped over. With the assistance of two men who
    arrived on the scene, Ms. Jones rendered assistance to the occupants of the
    beige car, two of whom suffered significant injuries. The appellant appeared
    uninjured when she left the car and began to text as she walked around. Ms.
    Jones testified that she concluded the appellant was the driver because she
    heard her say “I don’t know what happened, my car just lost control.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown adduced the statement of the appellant as part of its case at
    trial. The appellant did not testify.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All four passengers testified at trial. None of them was paying
    attention to the appellant’s drinking that day, although one passenger testified
    that she saw the appellant drinking at the bar and another testified that she
    saw the appellant with a drink in her hand at the bar. Each of the passengers
    testified that they had consumed alcohol  in the morning,  at the bar or at
    dinner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the scene, Officer Laurin observed that the appellant’s eyes were
    glassy and slightly bloodshot, although no issues were observed with the
    appellant’s motor abilities. Officer Laurin also noticed the odour of alcohol
    on the appellant’s breath.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar observations were made at the police station by Officer
    Kukkonen, a qualified breath technician. He administered two breath tests to
    the appellant which produced readings of 159 milligrams of alcohol per 100
    milliliters of blood and 161 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood,
    respectively.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the cause of the crash, none of the passengers expressed
    any concern as to the appellant’s manner of driving prior to the crash. Only one
    of the passengers, Hayley Smith, could assist with respect to the details of
    the crash itself. She testified that they were probably speeding a little bit
    and that they were having a good time listening to music, which was playing
    loudly on the radio, and singing as they approached a big curve. She stated
    that the appellant hit gravel and that she could not control the wheel and that
    was when the accident took place.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Officer McLaughlin was called as an expert witness on collision
    reconstruction. He inspected the appellant’s vehicle several weeks after the
    accident and after it had been removed from the scene. He testified that the
    appellant’s vehicle had a worn shock absorber, which could have existed prior
    to impact. He testified that a bent or worn shock absorber, tracking bar and/or
    wheel assembly could cause the car to go out of control. He accepted that it
    was a “probability, even if it’s a low probability” that prior damage to the
    shock absorber or control arm could have caused the accident. However, his
    expert testimony was that there was no mechanical failure that caused the
    crash.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Position of Counsel at Trial</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the charge to the jury, the trial judge related a summary of the
    positions both counsel had provided to him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the counts relating to the consumption of alcohol, the
    trial judge summarized the Crown’s position as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The accident happened because Megan Bacci’s ability to operate
    the Sebring was impaired by alcohol. Mechanical issues had nothing to do with
    the vehicle leaving the road.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Megan Bacci’s perception and judgment were affected by the
    alcohol in her body and she was not able to react to the changes in the road.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the counts alleging dangerous driving, the position of
    the Crown was that the manner of driving in which alcohol was a factor caused
    the accident and that “mechanical failure does not explain the Sebring leaving
    the road”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence position with respect to the charges before the court was
    that the Crown had failed to prove that either impairment by alcohol, or the
    manner of the appellant’s driving, caused the accident for five reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first reason advanced by counsel was summarized by the trial judge as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>One, the Crown has failed to prove that Megan Bacci's driving
    was a significant cause of the accident involving her car and her friends on
    May 19<sup>th</sup>, 2012. You have heard evidence from the Crown's own expert
    witness there is an equal possibility that the accident happened due to a
    mechanical failure notwithstanding his rigid position. More importantly Officer
    McLaughlin could not rule out the accident occurred due to a mechanical
    failure. This is a real factor to the accident and raises a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fifth reason, which bears on defence counsel’s interpretation of the
    appellant’s explanation to Ms. Jones of the cause of the accident, was summarized
    by the trial judge as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Five, the fifth and most important reason Megan Bacci is
    innocent is that you heard the words of Megan Bacci. They were clear, concise
    and correct. You heard evidence from Ms. Jones that the car made a screeching noise.
    This is a crucial fact that it's not [sic] been explained away, because it
    cannot be explained. The screeching noise you can infer came from the traction
    bar scraping against the roadway and that car just lost control. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is against this factual background and the positions taken by counsel
    in their closing addresses and in their respective written summaries of their
    position that the trial judge gave the jury the <em>W.(D.)</em> direction.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Grounds of Appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant outlined several grounds of appeal in her factum. In
    argument, counsel advanced only the ground that the trial judge erred in his <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction to the jury, both in the main charge and in the recharge to the
    jury, in relation to the statement made by the appellant to Ms. Jones to the
    effect: “I don’t know what happened. The car just lost control.”.</p>
  <p class=Heading>A.      The Charge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his charge to the jury, the trial judge gave the following
    instruction:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I want to mention one particular piece of evidence you heard
    because it is deserving of special treatment according to the law.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[1]      You heard from Alexandra Jones that she heard Megan
    Bacci state at the accident scene, &quot;I do not know what happened. My car
    just lost control.&quot; If you believe that this what was reported by
    Alexandra Jones was in fact said by Megan Bacci and if you accept Megan Bacci's
    explanation that her vehicle just lost control <span class=Underline>and you
    find this lose [sic] of control was caused entirely by mechanical failure</span>,
    you must find Megan Bacci not guilty of impaired operation causing bodily harm,
    operation of a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of over 80
    causing bodily harm and dangerous driving causing bodily harm. You might still
    find her guilty of the lesser included offences in counts 1 through 4. Even if
    you do not accept that Megan Bacci said what was reported by Alexandra Jones or
    accept Megan Bacci's explanation for what happened <span class=Underline>or
    accept the lose [sic] of control was caused entirely by mechanical failure</span>,
    if it leaves you with a reasonable doubt about whether Megan Bacci caused the
    accident and the accompanying bodily harm, you must find her not guilty of
    those offences because the Crown would have failed to prove an essential
    element, that is causation of those offences beyond a reasonable doubt. You may
    still, however, find her guilty of the lesser and included offences in counts 1
    through 4.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[2]      Even if the evidence does not 1eave you with a
    reasonable doubt about whether Megan Bacci caused the accident, you may convict
    Megan Bacci only if the rest of the evidence that you do accept proves her
    guilt on that essential element of causation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=right style='text-align:right'>(Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the trial judge made two errors in his
    initial charge:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred by adding an exculpatory interpretation to the
    statement made by the appellant; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred by misstating the standard of causation, in instructing
    the jury that the loss of control must be “<u>entirely</u> caused by mechanical
    failure” (emphasis added).</p>
  <h2><strong>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong><strong>Adding an </strong><strong>exculpatory</strong><strong> interpretation</strong></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The appellant
    says that the trial judge should only have instructed the jury that it must
    acquit if the jury believed the appellant’s statement that the vehicle lost
    control. The appellant contends that the inclusion of the additional
    requirement that the jury find that the loss of control was entirely caused by
    mechanical failure served to add an additional step not contemplated by <i>W.(D.)</i>.
    The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in subjecting the exculpatory
    explanation contained in the appellant’s statement to a higher degree of
    scrutiny than was appropriate.</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Crown argues
    that the appellant’s statement to Ms. Jones was properly the subject of a
    modified <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction. The Crown submits it is incorrect, as the
    appellant contends, that an acquittal would follow “if the statement was
    believed” in the circumstances of this case because, unlike the situation where
    a statement is clearly exculpatory on its face, the statement of the appellant
    is not obviously exculpatory in nature. While one interpretation of the appellant’s
    statement is exculpatory, this was not the only interpretation, as a vehicle
    may lose control for many reasons, one of which could be impairment of its
    operator based on the evidence in this case. Accordingly, the Crown submits
    that the trial judge properly focused on mechanical failure as the exculpatory
    interpretation of the appellant’s statement in line with the defence theory of
    the case, based on the evidence favourable to the defence, in order that the
    jury fully appreciate the exculpatory nature of the statement in the context of

  <p class=CQuote><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>What I take from a
    review of all of these authorities is that the principles underlying <i>W.(D.)</i> are not confined merely to cases where an accused testifies and his or her
    evidence conflicts with that of Crown witnesses. They have a broader sweep.
    Where, on a vital issue, there are credibility findings to be made between
    conflicting evidence called by the defence or arising out of evidence
    favourable to the defence in the Crown's case, the trial judge must relate the
    concept of reasonable doubt to those credibility findings. The trial judge must
    do so in a way that makes it clear to the jurors that it is not necessary for
    them to believe the defence evidence on that vital issue; rather, it is
    sufficient if – viewed in the context of all of the evidence – the conflicting
    evidence leaves them in a state of reasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt.
    In that event, they must acquit. (Citations omitted.)</span></strong></p>

  <p class=CQuote><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>Essentially, <i>W (D.)</i> simply unpacks for the benefit of the lay jury what reasonable doubt means in

    judge did not cause the jury to give extra scrutiny to the defence evidence,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span

    first branch of his <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction that the appellant was entitled
    to an acquittal if the jury found that the loss of control was “entirely caused
    by mechanical failure”, as the appellant was entitled to an acquittal on the
    basis of that finding. Had that instruction been the only instruction given to the
    jury, the jury may have been left with the impression that this was the only
    way in which an acquittal was available and that the onus of proof was on the
    appellant to establish that the accident was entirely caused by mechanical
    failure. The appellant was also entitled to an acquittal, even if the jury
    found the loss of control was not entirely caused by mechanical failure, if the

    operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm on both counts, but guilty of
    impaired operation of a motor vehicle simpliciter. That’s a lesser and included

    charge on <em>W.(D.)</em> was adequate to convey to the jury that they were not
    engaged in a credibility contest, but that in the circumstances of this case,
    burden was on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that impairment by
    alcohol was a significant contributory cause of the victims’ injuries with
    respect to all counts. Moreover, I am satisfied that the jury would have
    understood that even if they did not accept the explanation of the appellant
    that the accident was entirely caused by mechanical failure, they could
    nevertheless acquit if in the context of all of the evidence the explanation of
    the appellant gave rise to a reasonable doubt, or if the Crown failed to prove

    the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The one last area I want to mention the one particular piece of
    evidence you heard because it deserves special treatment and that's what Megan
    Bacci said that what Alexandra Jones stated that she heard that is, &quot;I do
    not know what happened, my car just lost control.&quot;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I want to repeat this to you. If you believe that what was
    reported by Alexandra Jones was in fact said by Megan Bacci, and if you accept
    Megan Bacci's explanation given to Alexandra Jones that her vehicle just lost
    control, <span class=Underline>and you find that this lost [sic] of control
    that is referred to was not caused by her in any way then you must find Megan
    Bacci not guilty of impaired operation</span> causing bodily harm, operation of
    a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration over 80 thereby causing
    bodily harm and dangerous driving causing bodily harm. You might still find her
    guilty of the lesser and included offences of 1through 4.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>So &quot;I do not know what happened, my car just lost control&quot;,
    that is from Alexandra Jones about what Megan Bacci said. So one, you have to
    consider whether you believe that what Alexandra Jones said was in fact said by
    Megan Bacci. You have to accept that that's Megan Bacci's explanation that the
    vehicle just lost control, you have to accept that explanation by her and <span
class=Underline>you have to find that this loss of control that's alluded to,
    that's referred was not caused by her any way, the lost [sic] of control of the
    vehicle was not caused by her in any way</span>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If you find those three things then you must find her not
    guilty on counts 1through 6. You still may find her guilty of the lesser and

    that the trial judge did not properly contextualize the recharge and identify
    that he was correcting a previous error and, thirdly, the appellant submits
    that the trial judge did not address further the second or third branch of the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction in the recharge (i.e. if the statement was disbelieved but raised a

    of the instruction he had given in his charge as to the application of <em>W.(D.)</em> to the statement of the appellant. The trial judge substituted the requirement
    that the jury find that the loss of control referred to in her statement “was
    not caused by her in any way” for his initial formulation “was caused entirely
    by mechanical failure.” The appellant renewed his objection that the trial
    judge should only have referred to the precise statement of the appellant and
    not have provided his interpretation of how the statement was rendered
    exculpatory.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span

    her statement was not clearly exculpatory, provided that the interpretation was
    consistent with the defence theory of the case, based on evidence favourable to
    the appellant. In the circumstances of this case it was available to the trial
    judge to interpret the loss of control referred in the appellant’s statement as
    “not caused by her in any way”, in order to provide an exculpatory dimension to
    the statement. That interpretation, although more general than his previous
    interpretation, is also consistent with the defence theory of the case and
    based on evidence favourable to the defence. There is no error with respect to
    the correction of the first branch of <em>W.(D.) </em>in the recharge. </p>

    treatment of the statement made by the appellant to Alexander Jones to the
    effect that “I do not know what happened, my car just lost control.” In his
    initial charge he dealt with all three branches of <em>W.(D.)</em> and, in
    particular, stated with respect to the first branch that the loss of control
    alluded to in her statement required a finding by the jury that the loss of
    control “was caused entirely by mechanical failure.” In the recharge the trial
    judge stated that “you have to find that this loss of control that’s alluded
    to, that’s referred was not caused by her any way, the lost [sic] of control of
    the vehicle was not caused by her in any way.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the recharge the trial judge did not identify the precise error he

    first branch of <em>W.(D.)</em> and indicating that they were not to find that
    the loss of control was “caused entirely by mechanical failure” but rather that
    the loss of control was “not caused by her in anyway.” The trial judge said
    nothing with respect to the second and third branch of <em>W.(D.)</em>.
    Accordingly, it would not have been clear to the jury whether the instruction
    on the second and third branches were still applicable or whether that
    instruction also was in need of correction. In my view, the manner in which the
    trial judge in his recharge sought to correct an error in his charge resulting
    from an objection by counsel for the appellant was inadequate and served only
    to confuse the jury. </p>

    matter of his charge, (i.e. the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction) and identified the
    precise error in his charge and explained the correction. </p>

    was entitled to an acquittal if the jury found that the loss of self-control
    was “not caused by her in any way”, as the appellant was entitled to an
    acquittal on that basis. Unfortunately, that was the only instruction the jury
    received on the application of <em>W.(D.)</em> in the recharge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was entitled to an instruction on <em>W.(D.)</em> – namely,

    accident in any way and found that she did cause the accident in some way, she
    was nevertheless entitled to an acquittal if her explanation that she did not
    cause the accident in any way was not accepted but raised a reasonable doubt or
    if the Crown failed to prove that impairment was a significant contributory
    cause. It is precisely the second and third branches of <em>W.(D.)</em> that
    bring home to the jury that an acquittal is warranted even if the statement is
    disbelieved but raises a reasonable doubt or if the statement is disbelieved
    and the rest of the evidence raises a reasonable doubt. The trial judge failed

  <p class=CQuote>The lesson from <em>R. v. W (D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742
    (S.C.C.), is that assessments of the credibility or reliability of exculpatory
    evidence in a criminal case do not raise either/or choices, but must reflect
    the application of the burden of proof placed on the Crown to prove its case
    beyond a reasonable doubt. An instruction to the jury to the effect that
    exculpatory evidence can be the source of a reasonable doubt even if not
    affirmatively believed is particularly important because it is arguably not the
    kind of common sense reasoning that jurors would apply in making credibility
    assessment in their day-to-day lives.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span

    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. However, the Crown concedes that it would have
    been preferable had the trial judge included the second and third branches of the <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction in the recharge. The Crown contends that the
    omission is not fatal, having regard to the charge as a whole and in particular
    to the fact that the jury was adequately instructed with respect to the <em>W.(D.)</em> direction in the main charge. A similar argument was raised in <em>R. v. S.
    (W.D.)</em>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521 and rejected. In that case the appellant
    argued that the trial judge seriously erred in that the second and third
    branches of the <em>W.(D.)</em> direction had not been put to the jury in the
    recharge. Cory J. stated, at p. 536:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It has been seen that the directions on the recharge on this
    vitally important issue were in error. Nonetheless, it was argued by the
    respondent that the charge must be looked at as a whole, and in light of the
    correct instructions given at the time of the main charge that the error in the
    recharge does not constitute a ground for directing a new trial. It was argued
    that the case of <em>R. v. W. (D), supra</em>, supported the position of the
    respondent. I cannot agree with that contention.</p>

    result of a question from the jury rather than as a result of an objection by
    defence counsel, I see no reason to accept the Crown’s argument in the
    circumstances of this case because of that distinction. The statement of the
    appellant encapsulates the essence of the defence in this case. It was central
    that the jury be properly instructed with respect to the direction in <em>W.(D.)</em>.
    In my view, the omission of the second and third branches of the <em>W.(D.)</em> direction constitutes serious non-direction amounting to misdirection with
    respect to a critical aspect of the defence. Moreover, the omission of the
    second and third branch of the <em>W.(D.) </em>does not appropriately reflect
    the burden of proof on the Crown with respect to causation which was a pivotal
    issue with respect to each of the charges against the accused. </p>
