  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice Peter
    N. Bourque of the Ontario Court of Justice on August 4, 2016.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Paciocco J.A.:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal by D.A. from his August 4, 2016 convictions of three historical
    sexual offence charges. His appeal is based exclusively on the judges denial
    of two s. 11(b) unreasonable delay applications D.A. brought. If either of D.A
    s. 11(b) applications should have been granted by the trial judge, D.A.s conviction
    appeal must be allowed since a successful s. 11(b) application would have
    required the charges to be stayed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.A.s first s. 11(b) application was brought prior to the decision in <em>R.
    v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. Its outcome therefore
    depended on the law developed in <em>R. v. Morin</em>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771. I
    refer to this first application as the <em>Morin</em> application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second application was brought after <em>Jordan</em> was decided.
    Although the factual foundation for the second application remained the same as
    the first application, D.A.s second application  his <em>Jordan</em> application
     was based on retroactive changes <em>Jordan</em> made to the law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not controversial that the delay in D.A.s case is presumptively
    unreasonable applying the <em>Jordan</em> test. In spite of this, D.A. is
    correct to concede before us that the outcome of his appeal turns on whether
    the trial judge erred in deciding the <em>Morin</em> application. This is
    because there is nothing in this case that would prevent the Crown from invoking
    its reasonable reliance on the <em>Morin</em> regime to defeat D.A.s
    transitional <em>Jordan</em> application.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial judge did err in deciding the <em>Morin</em> application.
    He was wrong in finding the <i>Morin </i>delay to be approximately 14 months. Properly
    analysed, the total <i>Morin </i>delay was upwards of 17 months, a period of
    delay that was not reasonable in the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge arrived at 14 months of <i>Morin </i>delay by holding
    D.A. responsible for the delay between February 26, 2015 and August 10, 2015,
    the day the trial date was set, because D.A. should have been ready to set a
    trial date on February 26, 2015 or shortly thereafter. There are several
    reasons why this finding was in error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, at the February 26, 2015 judicial pretrial the Crown gave an
    extensive disclosure package to D.A. That disclosure package included a video
    statement given by D.A., electronic discs, and more than 120 pages of printed
    material, including multiple police notes. The pretrial judge recognized that
    the pretrial could not go ahead because of the substantial, late disclosure
    that had just been made. Defence counsel needed time to review the disclosure before
    proceeding. In the face of this last minute, material disclosure, the trial
    judges conclusion that the Crown had substantially filled the essential
    disclosure requests by February 25, 2015, to an extent which allowed the matter
    to proceed further, to judicial pre-trial and then setting a trial date was
    unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, on February 26, 2015 D.A. stood charged only with youth
    offences. The adult charges that are the subject of this appeal had not yet
    even been laid. The delay in laying the adult charges arose because of a
    miscalculation by the investigator of D.A.s age during the period D.A. was
    alleged to have been carrying on a sexually exploitive relationship with the
    complainant, a neighbouring child. By February 26, 2015, that error had been
    discovered. D.A. was aware that the Crown was contemplating additional adult charges.
    The pretrial judge was also aware of this. Appropriately, the pretrial judge
    recognized that D.A. was in no position to move the case forward until the
    nature of the charges he would face was settled.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes this latter point but urges that since the adult
    charges were laid on March 17, 2015, D.A. should have been ready to set a trial
    date, at the latest, when the matter next returned to court on April 2, 2015.
    The Crown contends that this additional 5 weeks of delay should not change the
    outcome. There are several difficulties with the Crowns position.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    April 2, 2015 was the first appearance on the adult charges. The judicial pretrial
    set for that date was scheduled in youth court, relating to the youth matters. It
    is not reasonable to expect D.A. to have set a trial date on his first
    appearance on the adult charges, without the benefit of a pretrial on those
    charges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    underscore the unfairness in placing responsibility on D.A. to set a trial date
    on the adult charges on April 2, 2015, it is instructive that even on May 14,
    2015, the date that was set to accommodate a joint pretrial on the youth and
    adult matters, the Crown did not have the adult file in court. This led to yet
    a further adjournment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason why the Crowns contention that D.A. should have set the trial
    date on April 2, 2015 is unfair is that, once again, just before the April 2,
    2015 pretrial began the Crown gave yet another substantial disclosure package to
    D.A., consisting of both electronic and paper disclosure exceeding 80 pages. Since
    D.A.s counsel could not possibly review this material before the scheduled
    pretrial, the Crown agreed to adjourn the pretrial to May 14, 2015. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown suggested before us that its consent to adjourn the April 2, 2015
    pretrial because of its own last minute disclosure is unimportant in assessing
    unreasonable delay unless, by its nature, the information disclosed is shown to
    have been essential to the case. I do not agree. The accused is entitled to review
    disclosure they have received to determine its importance, before moving a case
    forward. Where, as here, that disclosure is made so late that it cannot be
    reviewed before a scheduled appearance, the Crown cannot fairly assert that the
    accused should go ahead and set a date at that scheduled appearance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final and most important reason why it was not fair to expect D.A. to set a
    trial date on April 2, 2015 is that essential disclosure was still outstanding
    on that date. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, disclosure had not yet been made of the occurrence report and
    police officers notes relating to the initial complaint. That complaint was
    made in April of 2012 when the police attended the complainants home on an
    unrelated matter. The Crown, incorrectly, was insisting that disclosure of this
    April 2012 information required a third party records application, hence the
    delay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    importance of the records relating to the initial police complaint in a sexual
    assault allegation is obvious, but those records took on added significance in
    this case. Disclosure that had been made suggested that the complainants mother
    initiated the complaint, and there were issues relating to the mothers credibility
    arising from an unsubstantiated allegation she made that D.A. had breached his
    bail conditions. The history of the complaint in this case mattered, as, of
    course, did any statements made by the complainant about what happened. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police
    notes about this April 2012 meeting were not disclosed until April 29, 2015. The
    third party records application was not heard until May 13, 2016, at which time
    the occurrence report itself was disclosed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    material proved to include statements from the complainant and her mother about
    the alleged assaults. It also included an allegation by the complainant that D.A.
    had attempted to persuade her not to go ahead with the complaint so that his
    life would not be ruined. The Crown ultimately relied upon this information at
    trial as post-offence conduct indicative of guilt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 11, 2015, two further pages of handwritten notes from the complainant
    were disclosed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    disclosure relating to statements made by D.A. to the police was still outstanding
    on April 2, 2015. While most of the information about D.A,s statements had already
    been disclosed, on March 17, 2015 defence counsel advised the Crown that an
    officer appeared to have interviewed D.A. twice. That officers notes were not
    disclosed until June 3, 2015. Despite a number of pretrial requests, audiotape
    evidence of D.A.s arrest relating to the implementation of his <em>Charter</em> rights was not disclosed until the third day of the trial. This information was
    important to the voluntariness of D.A.s statements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    when the trial judge rejected D.A.s <em>Morin</em> application he
    misapprehended the nature of the disclosure being sought relating to D.A.s
    statements. He discounted claims by D.A. that non-disclosure relating to statements
    D.A. had made was material, on the mistaken basis that there are no
    confessions or admissions. In fact, at the subsequent trial the Crown led a
    statement from D.A. as containing relevant admissions that supported the
    complainants account.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this record, it was not reasonable for the trial judge to find that D.A. was
    responsible for the delay after February 26, 2015 because of an unreasonable insistence
    on receiving nonessential disclosure before moving the case forward. Given the
    role played by the Crown in delaying the progress of the case and the
    outstanding material disclosure, it is not fair to blame D.A. for not moving
    the case forward on that date, on April 2, 2015, or arguably even on May 14,
    2015. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    applying the trial judges underestimated period of <i>Morin</i> delay, a delay
    of almost 14 months appreciably exceeds the <em>Morin</em> guideline for
    provincial trials of 8-10 months. The trial judge nonetheless denied the
    application because he found the case to be complex, the charges serious, and
    the prejudice modest.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    take no issue with the proposition that a trial judge may be entitled to refuse
    to stay a proceeding under the <em>Morin</em> regime after a 14 month delay in
    a complex case involving a serious charge where the delay had a modest level
    of repercussions for the accused. That, however, is not this case. When defence
    delay is properly quantified, the total <i>Morin </i>delay is upwards of 17
    months. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I cannot accept the trial judges conclusion that this prosecution was complex.
    This was a standard credibility case made only marginally more difficult
    because the prosecution involved both youth and adult charges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge may also have underestimated the prejudice to D.A. caused by the
    delay. The trial judge noted in his decision that a defendant who insists upon
    all elements of disclosure before setting dates runs the risk of being
    content with the pace of proceedings. Given that the trial judge mistakenly
    believed that D.A. was insisting on all elements of disclosure before setting
    dates, his sense of the prejudice the delay was causing D.A. may have been
    unfairly minimized.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, notwithstanding that the charges against D.A. were extremely serious, the
    trial judge erred in denying D.A.s <em>Morin</em> application. Properly
    calculated, the total <i>Morin </i>delay came close to doubling the <em>Morin</em> guidelines in a non-complex case where there was some prejudice. Much of that
    delay was attributable to the Crowns errors or last-minute disclosure
    practices. The <em>Morin</em> application should have been allowed. The charges
    against D.A. should have been stayed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore allow D.A.s conviction appeal, set aside the convictions, and
    stay the proceedings on the charges that are before us.</p>
