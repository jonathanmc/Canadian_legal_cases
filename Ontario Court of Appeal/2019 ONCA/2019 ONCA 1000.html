  <p class=Judge><strong>By the Court:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>The panel that originally
    heard this appeal ordered that the appeal be re-heard by a differently
    constituted panel: </span><span style='line-height:100%'>2019 ONCA 653.</span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'> That panel withdrew the reasons it had
    released in error after the original hearing. No submissions were made to us
    with respect to those reasons and this panel has not read or considered those
    reasons in coming to the following conclusions.</span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s claim against the appellants,
    Ross and Barbara Lightle, is based upon certain guarantees. The guarantees
    relate to 25 mortgage loans given by the respondent to the named corporate
    entities formed by the appellants to invest in 25 separate interests in a
    residential real estate development known as “Godstone”. The mortgages went
    into default and the respondent sued the appellants on their guarantees.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There were two types of guarantee. The mortgages
    themselves contained guarantees (the “covenant guarantees”) and the appellants
    executed five separate instruments by which they personally guaranteed the
    amounts owing on the 25 mortgages (the “stand-alone guarantees”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found the appellants liable on
    the five stand-alone guarantees, rejecting their argument that the claim was
    barred by the </span><em>Limitations Act</em><i><span lang=EN-US>,</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> 2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24. He found that as the evidence only proved
    that they had authorized the registration of the 1336367 Alberta Ltd. mortgages,
    they were only liable on the covenant guarantees for those mortgages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent had sued the lawyer who had acted
    for her on these and other transactions for negligence. The allegations of
    negligence included but were not limited to failure to obtain proper security
    for her mortgage investments. That action was settled for a global sum. The
    trial judge reduced the amount owing on the guarantees by 50% to account for
    the proceeds of the settlement and to avoid double recovery.</span></p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>iSSUES</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The following issues arise on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellants submit that the trial
    judge erred in finding that the applicable statutory limitation period for the
    claim on the stand-alone guarantees was ten years pursuant to the </span><em>Real
    Property Limitations Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, and not
    the two-year period in the </span><em>Limitations</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><span
lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellants submit that the trial
    judge erred by reducing the amount owing by only 50% to account for the
    proceeds of the settlement and argue that the proper reduction is 100%.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, by cross-appeal, the respondent submits
    that the trial judge erred by reducing on account of the settlement the amount
    owing by as much as 50%. The respondent argues that there should no reduction
    on account of the settlement, or if there is a reduction, it should only be 28.8%.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>Fourth, by cross-appeal, the
    respondent argues that the trial judge erred in dismissing the claims based
    upon four of the five covenant guarantees.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that the respondent’s
    claim is governed by the </span><em>Limitations Act</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>and, as the respondent’s claim was brought more than two years after
    the claims on the guarantees arose, her claim is statute barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected that submission and
    found that the respondent had brought her claim within the applicable
    limitation period, namely ten years, as her claim was governed by the<i> </i></span><em>Real

    the interest of the person liable on the covenant in the mortgaged lands was
    conveyed or transferred. [Emphasis added]</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The crucial question is whether the stand-alone
    guarantees fall within the emphasized words: “any other instrument … to repay
    the whole or part of any money secured by a mortgage”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>“Instrument” is
    routinely used to describe a formal legal document in writing: P.G. Osborn, </span><em>A
    Concise Law Dictionary</em><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'>, 5th ed. (London:
    Sweet and Maxwell, 1964), at p. 171; David M. Walker, </span><em>The Oxford

    Dictionary of Canadian Law</em><span lang=EN-US style='line-height:100%'> (Toronto: Carswell, 1991), at p. 523. The word “instrument” is not defined in
    the </span><em>Real Property Limitations Act.</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In support of their argument that “instrument” should
    be given a narrower meaning that does not embrace the stand-alone mortgage
    guarantees, the appellants make two submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, they submit that the language of s. 43(1)
    must be read in the light of the circumstances that existed at the time of its
    predecessor’s enactment in 1939 and that “instrument” should be narrowly
    interpreted to deal only with those specific circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, they argue that the interpretation of
    the word “instrument” in the </span><em>Real Property Limitations Act</em> <span
lang=EN-US>should be governed by the definition of that same word in the </span><em>Registry</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.20, s. 1, limiting the
    meaning to instruments affecting title to land and executed with the requisite
    formalities to allow for registration.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, the trial judge properly rejected
    both submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We deal first with the historical argument.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Prior to 1893, the limitation period to enforce
    a mortgage was ten years. However, the limitation period to enforce the
    covenant to pay the mortgage was the 20-year period that applied to
    specialties. That was because the covenant was contained within a sealed
    document and a sealed document was a specialty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The legislature removed that anomaly by amending
    the </span><em>Limitations Act</em><span lang=EN-US> in 1893 to exclude
    covenants contained in a mortgage from the definition of specialty, with the
    result that both claims to enforce the mortgage and claims on the covenant were
    from that point governed by the same limitation period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 1939, the legislature amended the </span><em>Mortgages</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><span lang=EN-US> to make a new owner who purchased from the
    original mortgagor and was liable to indemnify the mortgagor for the mortgage
    debt directly liable to the mortgagee for the debt secured by mortgage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A corresponding amendment in 1939 to what would
    become the </span><em>Real Property Limitations Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, s.
    43(1) introduced the words “or any other instrument” that are at issue on this
    appeal. The appellants argue that as this language was used to accommodate the
    new provision in the </span><em>Mortgages</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><span
lang=EN-US> making the new owner liable to the mortgagee, it can have no wider meaning
    today and therefore must be restricted to covenants contained within mortgages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are unable to accept that submission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, there is no legislative history to
    support the narrow meaning. At the time, there was no Hansard of the legislative
    debates. The appellants can point to no record of committee reports or
    background studies to explain the evolution or purpose of the amendment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, even assuming that the appellant’s
    contention regarding the immediate purpose of adding the words “any other
    instrument” is plausible, the plain meaning of those words does not require or
    support such a narrow interpretation. If the legislature had truly intended to
    limit the meaning to covenants by subsequent purchasers, it could easily have
    said so. Instead the legislature used general language that can readily be
    interpreted to embrace stand-alone guarantees.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, we agree with the trial judge, at para.
    51, that there is “no justification for having different limitation periods
    depending on whether the guarantee covenant is in the mortgage or in a separate
    document.” Giving “any other instrument” the narrow reading sought by the
    appellants would introduce an anomalous distinction between identical
    guarantees. It would also create an awkward distinction between the limitation period
    to enforce a mortgage and the limitation period to enforce a closely related
    promise to pay the debt secured by the mortgage. The legislature removed a
    similar distinction that existed before 1893 and it is difficult to see why the
    legislature would want to create a similar distinction in 1939.</span></p>

    a debt owing and yet to be collected, while the claim against the solicitor was
    for damages in negligence at large without any allocation to the respondent’s
    loss arising from unenforceable guarantees. The negligence alleged included the
    failure to ensure properly enforceable guarantees to secure the mortgages and
    the loss claimed included the amount secured by the guarantees. The respondent
    contends that the negligence claim cannot reduce the amount owing on the debt
    and the issue of double recovery only arises in relation to the negligence

    no reduction of the judgment based on the settlement is open to the respondent

    reduced by the recovery in the settlement of the negligence claim against the
    respondent’s solicitor. Assuming, without deciding, that the appellants’
    submission is sound in law, we are satisfied that it fails on the evidence in

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The rule against double recovery in negligence is a corollary of
    the fundamental principle of full and fair compensation. As McLachlin J.
    explained in <em>Cunningham v. Wheeler; Cooper v. Miller; Shanks v. McNee</em>,
    [1994] 1 S.C.R. 359, at pp. 368-69, “[t]<span style='background:white'>he
    fundamental principle” is that the plaintiff is entitled to damages in an amount
    “which will return the plaintiff to the position the plaintiff would have been
    in had the accident not occurred, in so far as money is capable of doing this.”
    The corollary is that “the compensation must be fair to both the plaintiff and
    the defendant.” The ideal is to achieve compensation that is “full and fair … awarding
    damages for all the plaintiff's actual losses, and no more. The watchword is
    restoration; what is required to restore the plaintiff to his or her
    pre-accident position. </span><em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>Double

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The rule against double recovery derives from
    both common law and equitable principles. At common law, recovery against one
    wrongdoer barred action against another while equity provided a remedy against
    unjust enrichment. The rule is commonly applied in tort actions where two
    wrongdoers are responsible to compensate the plaintiff for a loss. The plaintiff
    is entitled to pursue claims against both tortfeasors but cannot recover more
    than his or her loss: recovery against one wrongdoer will reduce the amount the
    plaintiff can recover from the other.</span><span lang=EN-US> </span><span
lang=EN-US>As explained in </span><em>Treaty Group Inc. v. Drake International
    Inc.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (2005)</span></em><em>,</em> 36 C.C.L.T.
    (3d) 265 (ON SC), at para. 7, citing <em>Cuttell v. Bentz</em><span lang=EN-US> (1985), 65 B.C.L.R. 273 (C.A.): “</span>The important point however is that ‘it
    is clear that one cannot recover a loss twice.’ (at p. 277) This is because, as
    Lambert J.A. explained at p. 283, ‘The rationale of the rule is that the
    claimant should not be permitted to receive in compensation a total amount greater
    than the loss he has suffered.’”</p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We agree with the respondent’s submission that
    her claim for the guaranteed debt owed to her by the appellants was neither
    barred nor diminished by reason of her claim in negligence against her

    settlement of the respondent’s claim against her solicitor.</span></p>

    double </span><em>recovery</em><span lang=EN-US>. It does not preclude a
    plaintiff from pursuing different defendants for the same loss and only
    precludes a plaintiff from recovering more than he or she lost. Here, there is
    no basis in the evidence to conclude that the respondent has recovered anything
    on the debt guaranteed by the appellants. Indeed, the trial judge’s finding that
    the standalone guarantees are valid and enforceable is not consistent with his
    finding that 50% of the settlement should be attributed to the claim on the guarantees.</span></p>

    achieves full or substantial satisfaction of the debt she is owed, there can be
