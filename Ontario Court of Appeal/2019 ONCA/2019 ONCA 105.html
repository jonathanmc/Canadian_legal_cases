    and the sentence imposed on February 12, 2016 by Justice Cory A. Gilmore of the
    Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><strong>Fairburn J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>OVERVIEW </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was a registered investment
    advisor. Over the course of eight years he persuaded unsuspecting friends,
    acquaintances, neighbours and clients to make investments in return for what
    they believed were positions or shares in various companies. Fourteen complainants
    testified about their dealings with the appellant, what he had told them, and
    how they had been relieved of their money under false pretences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s claim
    that he had told the complainants the truth about their investments and that he
    should not be found liable for any misunderstanding on their part. She found the
    appellant to have been a combative, belligerent, disingenuous, and sarcastic
    witness. In her detailed reasons, she said that the appellant’s evidence
    pressed the “limits of reality”, had “no relationship to reality”, and was
    “preposterous and nonsensical”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the end, the appellant was convicted of fraud
    over $5,000 in the context of what was essentially a large-scale Ponzi-type scheme
    and sentenced to four years in custody. Focusing on the fourteen complainants
    who actually testified, the trial judge concluded that they had been defrauded of
    $413,500. She ordered the appellant to pay restitution to five complainants,
    who she said had specifically asked for restitution, totaling $109,150. A fine
    in lieu of forfeiture in the same amount was also imposed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals against his conviction. He
    says that the trial judge erred by: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>(a)     misapprehending
    the evidence; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>(b)     improperly
    applying the rule in <em>Browne v. Dunn</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (1839), 6 R. 67 (U.K. H.L.)</span></em>; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>(c)     wrongly
    relying upon hearsay evidence; and </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'>(d)     failing
    to properly apply the “single transaction rule”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In addition, both the appellant and Crown appeal
    against sentence, the appellant claiming that the fine in lieu of forfeiture was
    too high, the Crown claiming it was too low. The Crown also objects to the
    failure to grant a restitution order to one of the complainants, Peter Edwards,
    who the Crown says specifically asked for an order of restitution. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    conviction appeal, grant leave to appeal sentence, dismiss the appellant’s
    sentence appeal and grant the Crown’s sentence appeal. </span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>GENERAL </span>BACKGROUND<span lang=EN-US> FACTS </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the Crown alleged that the fraud
    involved many complainants and over $1.8 million in loss, the prosecution focused
    upon the appellant’s dealings with the fourteen complainants who testified at
    trial. They came from different walks of the appellant’s life. Some were his long-time
    friends, some the friends of his father, some his neighbours, and some his clients
    from his time working with various investment firms. None were sophisticated
    investors. Each testified about the trust they had placed in the appellant. With
    the exception of one complainant, the trial judge accepted their credibility
    and the accuracy of their evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant told the complainants that he knew
    of private companies that were selling positions or shares in order to raise
    money to go public, or improve their financial picture. He told the complainants
    that they would double or triple their money. He often promised quick returns,
    sometimes claiming that money would double or triple within a matter of months.
    After they “invested”, the complainants were often told about how well their
    “investments” were doing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Though the appellant’s pitch morphed over time
    and between complainants, he generally used the same types of lies to get the
    complainants to believe that they were making good investments. The complainants
    testified about how they made their “investments”. At the appellant’s
    direction, they were told to forward him cash, cheques made out in his name,
    cheques made out to him in trust, cheques given to him with the payee left
    blank, and cheques to third parties whom the complainants did not know.
    Although the complainants testified about their concern for the unconventional manner
    in which their investments were made, their trust in the appellant prevailed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Contrary to his promises, the appellant did not
    broker a sale of shares or positions in the named companies for his clients. No
    documentation was provided to the complainants confirming that they were
    entitled to shares or debt in the private companies. The private companies, in
    turn, had no record of the complainants buying their investments. Instead, the
    appellant converted the money to his own use. Much of it was intermingled with
    his own funds. Later, when some complainants were demanding an explanation,
    documentation, or a return of their money, he found new investors and arranged
    for them to write cheques that could be delivered to the early investors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified at trial and maintained
    that he did not misappropriate the funds. Rather, the appellant maintained that
    he was himself the owner of shares or positions, and he was facilitating their
    resale to his clients. They may have misunderstood the nature of the
    transaction, but it was through no fault of his own. The complainants may have
    lost the value of their investment, but that was the nature of private
    investments. The trial judge did not believe the appellant when he testified
    that he had any right to the shares in either the various private companies, or
    the shell company Hyberlab. As mentioned, the trial judge entirely rejected the
    appellant’s evidence, finding “his insistence on this fabricated reality to be
    disingenuous and not believable.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge meticulously detailed the
    particulars of the appellant’s fraudulent conduct in her reasons for
    conviction. I will address the facts as they arise in the conviction appeal.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In explaining why I reject this ground of
    appeal, I will address the alleged misapprehensions under three categories. The
    first pertains to the appellant’s arguments about evidence informing what I
    will refer to as the “Magnet transactions”. I will then consider his arguments
    related to “other transactions” and conclude by addressing his arguments about alleged
    misapprehensions of evidence relating to “industry standards”. </span></p>
  <h3><em><span style='line-height:200%'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em>Magnet
    Transactions </em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellant’s observation that the
    verdicts turned largely on the trial judge’s findings relating to the transactions
    associated with the shell company Hyberlab. I disagree with his observation
    that the trial judge’s reasons reflect six misapprehensions of evidence in
    relation to those transactions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Some background is required. The appellant
    testified that Gregg Galbraith, who did not testify at trial, was an executive
    within Hyberlab. Galbraith was said to hold a term promissory note with
    Hyberlab, dated January 5, 1999, entitling him to 9.15 million common shares or
    $183,000. The Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”) issued a cease trade order
    against Hyberlab on June 24, 1999, meaning that Hyberlab would need OSC
    approval before it could resume trading. Hyberlab was in significant debt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified that in 2002, Galbraith
    asked him to help get Hyberlab trading again. The appellant maintained that he
    could accomplish that by merging Hyberlab with a private corporation by way of
    a reverse takeover. The appellant said that Galbraith and he entered into an
    agreement that, upon a successful merger, the appellant would receive the 9.15
    million shares (one million to be returned to Galbraith) or $183,000. The
    appellant produced a signed agreement to that effect, dated February 17, 2003, something
    that was referred to as both a promissory note and a debenture. The agreement
    stipulated that should the merger referenced in the agreement not take place,
    the appellant’s interest in the debenture would be ended.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s position was that the merger
    referenced in the agreement did not take place, and the appellant did not have
    – at any material time – an interest in the 1999 Hyberlab promissory note. The
    appellant testified that the 2003 agreement was open ended and he was looking
    for a company with which to complete the merger since that time. The trial
    judge accepted the Crown’s position and rejected the appellant’s evidence.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2005, Magnet Innovations was looking to go
    public and needed a “clean” shell with which to merge. Many of the complainants
    testified about their belief that the appellant had sold them shares and
    positions in Magnet. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although two letters of intent between Magnet
    and Hyberlab were signed in April and September, 2005, those letters had
    expired by December, 2005 and were never renewed. The lawyer for Magnet
    confirmed in evidence that nothing happened after the second letter of intent
    was prepared. Although Magnet continued looking for a viable shell company, there
    was no particular attachment to Hyberlab, and the appellant’s former investment
    firm told Magnet that Hyberlab was not a viable clean shell company. The merger
    never happened. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Magnet also decided to raise capital through
    promissory notes and loans. Magnet’s lawyer testified that the appellant was to
    assist in raising capital, but that he was difficult to deal with and that his
    paperwork had concerning discrepancies. The lawyer said that Magnet was not
    able to rectify many of the discrepancies that arose from the appellant’s
    transactions. Indeed, at the time of trial, the witness was still dealing with
    people who thought that they had loaned money to Magnet through the appellant.
    Yet, Magnet had no record of those people. In any event, at no time was the
    appellant authorized to sell shares in Magnet.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant makes several arguments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant complains that the trial
    judge misapprehended the relationship between Hyberlab and Magnet, and the
    appellant’s authority to sell positions in them. I disagree. The trial judge’s comprehensive
    reasons demonstrate that she clearly understood that Hyberlab was a shell
    company that was subject to a cease trade order and that Magnet was a company
    looking for a “clean” shell. She also clearly understood the appellant’s
    testimony that he was selling his own positions in Hyberlab and his position
    that his clients were confused through no fault of his own. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was open to the trial judge, however, to
    reject that evidence and find that it was actually the appellant who conflated
    Hyberlab and Magnet in order to effect the fraud, leading many of the
    complainants to believe that they were buying shares in Magnet. It was also
    open to the trial judge to find on the evidence that the appellant was not
    entitled to trade shares in Magnet, he did not have an interest in the 1999
    Hyberlab promissory note, and in any event did not inform the complainants they
    were ostensibly sinking their money into the highly questionable 2003 Hyberlab
    debenture. Even if it was a legitimate debenture, it would never be realized if
    a merger with Magnet did not crystalize. I agree with Crown counsel that the fraud
    lay in the fact that the appellant did not reveal to the complainants the true
    state of affairs, misled them about what their money was directed at, and did
    not reveal to them the actual risks associated with their “investments”. The
    reasons for judgment demonstrate the trial judge’s clear understanding of those
    facts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant says that the trial judge
    erred in rejecting his evidence by noting that the letters of intent between Hyberlab
    and Magnet did not make reference to a portion of Hyberlab’s debt being held by
    a third party. He also argues that she was wrong to suggest that the appellant claimed
    that the letters of intent were binding, when in fact he acknowledged that they
    were not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I need not get into this issue in any detail. While
    I see no problem with the trial judge’s approach to the letters of intent, even
    if she was wrong, the letters played only a peripheral role in her rejection of
    the appellant’s otherwise implausible evidence. The fact is that the
    appellant’s evidence was rejected for a multitude of reasons that far surpassed
    the issue relating to the letters of intent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    erred by failing to consider that some of the complainants acknowledged that their
    investments would be illiquid and non-refundable and that, if the deal with
    Magnet did not succeed, another merger with Hyberlab would have to be sought. Although
    the appellant is right that some of the complainants acknowledged that they
    knew they were assuming risk, the trial judge found that the appellant diverted
    their funds to his own use and misled the complainants about the nature and extent
    of risk associated with their investment. In light of that factual finding,
    there was no need to repeat the minutiae of each complainant’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, the appellant claims that the trial
    judge erred by finding that there was no possibility for a merger between
    Hyberlab and Magnet after 2005. He says that she ignored evidence of ongoing,
    good faith talks between the lawyer to Magnet and the appellant, long after
    that time frame. I do not agree. Read contextually, the lawyer’s testimony does
    not support that position. While Magnet continued to look for a clean shell
    company to merge with after the letters of intent had expired, the appellant’s
    former employer, the investment firm Standard Securities, discouraged Magnet
    from dealing with Hyberlab because it was not a “clean” shell.   </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s findings about letters that Magnet
    investors received from Gregg Galbraith, who owned the promissory note in
    Hyberlab. The letters said that Galbraith undertook to deliver shares in
    Hyberlab or any successor company upon the completion of a reverse takeover and
    financing. The appellant took the position that the letters confirmed that the
    complainants had made investments in his 2003 Hyberlab debenture. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Leaving
    aside the fact that many of the complainants had been led to believe that they
    had actually bought shares in Magnet, the trial judge understandably questioned
    the authenticity of the Galbraith letters. She was skeptical for a few reasons,
    including that Galbraith did not testify at trial. She also questioned how
    Galbraith could promise his interest in the debenture to the complainants when
    he had already promised it to the appellant, and how he could give those
    promises while the cease trade order was still in place. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with the appellant that the trial judge misunderstood his evidence
    about Galbraith. She understood his evidence, she just rejected it. The trial
    judge was not required to accept the appellant’s explanations about the
    operation of the letters of undertaking and she was not required to accept the
    letters as authentic.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the absence of Galbraith’s evidence, the trial judge showed understandable
    skepticism about the origin of the letters. Additionally, she was right to note
    the fact that any shares that Galbraith <em>may </em>have had, had already been
    promised to the appellant. The same shares were later being promised to the
    complainants. Having rejected the appellant’s evidence as a fabrication, there
    was nothing precluding the trial judge from making those factual observations. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence about
    promissory notes – from both Magnet and another company called ESSX – that he
    sold to some of the complainants, and wrongly concluded that this formed part
    of the fraud. These notes, he says, were acknowledged to be legitimate by
    Magnet’s lawyer and some of them have been honoured. Any loss in value is due
    to Magnet failing as a business, not any misconduct on his part. Again, I
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge fairly summarized the evidence of the complainants, including where
    their dealings with the appellant involved these promissory notes. As Crown
    counsel points out, these complainants thought they were purchasing shares
    directly from the companies, and it appears that the manner in which the
    appellant dealt with these  promissory notes was consistent with the
    appellant’s practice of deliberately obfuscating the nature of his client’s
    investments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no misapprehension of the evidence. The manner in which the appellant dealt
    with his clients was part of the narrative at trial. Most importantly, the
    genuine sales of promissory notes were not considered by the trial judge to be
    part of the fraud, as is made clear in her reasons for judgment and sentence.</p>
  <h3><em>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></em><em>Other Transactions</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had been hired by Paul Brent to raise funds for a corporate entity
    that resulted in a publicly traded company called Airesurf. Unfortunately,
    Brent died before trial. Accordingly, most of the information about Brent came
    from the appellant’s testimony. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s commission for raising funds for Airesurf was to come in the form
    of Airesurf shares. The appellant sold Airesurf shares to his clients. He said at
    trial that Brent owned the shares that the appellant was selling, but did not
    tell his clients this at the material time. When Brent died, the appellant testified
    that there was nothing the appellant could do to remedy the fact that many of
    his clients had not yet received their shares. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence when she
    concluded that the appellant had taken no steps to deliver the Airesurf shares
    to the complainants after Brent’s death. He says that the trial judge
    misunderstood to whom the shares belonged. I disagree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence. She found as a fact that the
    fraud lay in the appellant’s efforts to have the complainants believe that they
    were purchasing positions or shares in Airesurf, when the appellant had no
    ability to complete the sale. The trial judge’s reference to the appellant’s failure
    to take any steps to have the Airesurf shares delivered to the complainants after
    Brent’s death simply revealed one of the many reasons for why she rejected the
    appellant’s explanation as to what had happened. After all, if the appellant
    had sold Brent’s shares to the complainants, surely he would have taken steps
    to have those shares delivered after Brent’s untimely death. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also objects to the trial judge’s allegedly mistaken conclusion that
    he had sold portions of the Hyberlab debenture in relation to a merger with a
    company named EnerBrite/ESSX. He says that there was no evidence about a
    proposed merger between EnerBrite and Hyberlab. I disagree. Read contextually,
    the trial judge was simply drawing parallels between the appellant’s approach
    to Magnet and his approach to Enerbrite/ESSX. She was not saying that the
    appellant told investors that there would be a merger between Hyberlab and
    Enerbrite/ESSX, she was saying that the appellant’s deceit in relation to
    Magnet and Enerbite/ESSX was of a similar nature. </p>
  <h3><em>(iii)</em><em>Industry Standards </em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant claims that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence regarding
    whether he was under an obligation to report any business he was doing outside
    of the investment company that employed him, Standard Securities. He also
    complains that the trial judge misapprehended the expert evidence in the same
    way. I disagree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge understood that neither the witness from Standard Securities, nor
    the expert witness, could point to written policies or rules that prohibited
    the appellant from engaging in outside business or “off-book” trading. Even so,
    taken in context, the evidence clearly supported the trial judge’s findings
    that outside business activities had to be disclosed and that off-book trading
    had to be reflected in the records of the brokerage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless,
    I agree with the Crown that any potential misapprehension of evidence regarding
    industry or business standards would be immaterial to the result in this case.
    The trial judge’s reasons turned on the overwhelming evidence that the
    appellant failed to disclose material facts to the complainants, took advantage
    of their trust in him, deliberately obfuscated what they were “investing” in,
    and directed the funds to his own use. </p>
  <h3><em>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em><em>Conclusion </em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were no misapprehensions of evidence and, even if there were, they were not
    material in nature and did not play an essential role in the reasoning process
    that resulted in convictions. </p>

    appellant produced for the first time his day planners and what he referred to
    as his “trade blotters”. The Crown took no objection to the appellant making
    reference to those documents to refresh his memory or to the admission of those
    documents in evidence. The difficulty was that, as the appellant’s evidence continued
    to unfold, the day planners and blotters were used to suggest that the
    appellant and complainants had engaged in discussions and that he had done
    transactions on their behalf, a great deal of which had not been put to the complainants
    when they testified. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Crown counsel made an immediate objection to
    what was happening, raising a concern that the appellant was testifying to
    matters that could be seen to diminish the complainants’ credibility, but to
    which the complainants had been given no opportunity to respond. Defence counsel
    responded that, although it was possible that he had failed to put certain
    matters to the complainants, it would have been an oversight on his part and
    the remedy was not to preclude the appellant from testifying about those
    matters. The trial judge permitted the appellant to continue and said that she
    would determine an appropriate remedy at the end. The appellant kept using the
    planners and blotters to testify about conversations and transactions that he
    said had taken place with the complainants and, where necessary, the Crown
    continued to voice an objection. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is against that backdrop that the trial judge
    made the impugned comments in her reasons for judgment. She recounted that the
    appellant had relied on his day planners and blotters to verify what he had
    described as a proper documenting of the transactions. She then identified the
    “problem”: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The problem was that neither the accounting
    nor the circumstances related to it was ever put to any of the complainants. I
    accept that the Crown was left in a difficult position in not being able to
    respond to this documentary evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the Crown that the reliability of
    the blotters and the day planners is therefore diminished considerably and that
    they can be considered no more than self-serving statements of Mr. Schoer that
    he only thought of at trial.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant maintains that the trial judge
    erred by concluding that the appellant was under an obligation to put the
    entries on his internal records to the complainants. He also maintains that the
    trial judge erred by finding that the appellant had fabricated the documents
    during the course of the trial and using that fabrication as circumstantial
    evidence of guilt. </span></p>

    counsel are not required to confront a witness with every bit of evidence upon which
    he or she may be contradicted, fairness requires that the witness be confronted
    on contradictory matters of substance so that the witness can be given an
    opportunity to explain: </span><em>R. v. Quansah, </em><span lang=EN-US>2015

    an understandable way. She decided to place less weight on the reliability of
    the evidence arising from the blotters and day planners because they were used
    to partially advance a narrative that had not been put to some of the
    complainants. Although defence counsel initially raised the possibility of
    recalling the complainants, the trial Crown voiced a strong objection and the
    defence did not press the matter. There were simply too many witnesses and too
    many transactions to make recalling the witnesses practical. Against that
    contextual backdrop, the trial judge’s decision to deal with the matter in her
    reasons for judgment was understandable. In these circumstances, it was
    entirely open to her to place less weight on the appellant’s evidence arising
    from the blotters and day planners. </span></p>

    confronted with the appellant’s version of what had happened between the
    appellant and complainants, including when, how and in what circumstances they
    had parted with their money. Moreover, prior to the impugned comments being
    made, the trial judge had already expressed concern about the credibility of
    the appellant’s evidence and the authenticity of documents he had produced. In
    the circumstances, it is unsurprising that the trial judge said that the
    reliability of the blotters and day planners had been “diminished
    considerably”. I see no error in that approach. </span></p>

    the day planners and blotters that way, the appellant’s evidence as a whole
    provided support for a complete rejection of his credibility. As previously
    mentioned, the trial judge found him combative and sarcastic, belligerent and intent
    on advancing a narrative that had no relationship to reality. The application
    of a remedy for a breach of </span><em>Browne v. Dunn </em><span lang=EN-US>was
    only one small piece that led to that conclusion. </span></p>

    sent to the OSC by a lawyer involved with Hyberlab. The letter inquired into a
    number of things, including whether Galbraith could sell, transfer or assign
    his interest in the term promissory note to a third party purchaser,
    particularly in light of the cease trade order. The appellant introduced that
    letter into the trial record, claiming that he was told that the OSC had

    the truth of its contents, to find that he must have known from the letter that

    the one the appellant asked her to draw does not mean that the letter was used
    for the truth of its contents. It was simply used as a piece of circumstantial

    capacity as an investment advisor, he actively and intentionally preyed upon
    people who trusted him, by deceiving them into thinking that their money was
    being used to invest, either in shares or some other position in corporate

    how restitution requests can be made and creating Forms 34.1 (“Statement of

    filed a book of materials at sentencing that included various victim impact
    statements. Again with the consent of the defence, not all were read aloud, but
    it was indicated that all would be relied upon. The majority of complainants
    who filed victim impact statements and statements of restitution did so in the
    newly codified </span><em>Criminal Code </em><span lang=EN-US>forms. Mr.
    Edwards filed a victim impact statement using a form provided by the Ministry
    of the Attorney General predating the amendments, and included in it his loss
    of $17,000. The new Form 34.2 contains a warning that it is “not an application
    for compensation or restitution.” In contrast, the Ministry form that pre-dated
    the legislative change states that “providing information about the financial
    impact of a crime may not necessarily lead to payment for your losses or
    expenses through the criminal justice system.” </span></p>

    trial judge, this was a document intensive trial and sentencing. Certain
    complainants who testified at trial did not fill out victim impact statements
    and did not claim any restitution. The Crown indicated during the sentencing
    hearing that he was only seeking restitution for those people who had claimed
    it. In light of the Crown submission about what restitution was being sought, it
    is possible that the trial judge misunderstood the extent of the request.</span></p>

    did the trial judge – that Mr. Edwards did address his $17,000 loss in the

    as an exhibit and relied upon by the trial Crown. There is nothing in the form

    perpetrated a large-scale and complex fraud, making it difficult and, in many
    cases, impossible to locate the victim investors’ money. Accordingly, while the
    trial Crown maintained that the amount of the fraud was just over $1.8 million,
    when addressing the fine in lieu of forfeiture, he limited his request to
    $413,500 or what he described as the “most conservative” transactions possible.
    Those transactions covered situations where complainants had testified about
    how they had been directed by the appellant to pay for their “investments”: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='

  <p class=AParaNumbering style='

    cash; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='

    cashed by third parties; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='line-height:normal'><span
class=MsoPageNumber>(e)     writing cheques to other people at the appellant’s
    request. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant took the position,
    repeated in this court, that the forfeiture provisions should not apply to any
    of the complainants’ money that went to third parties. Excluding the payments
    to third parties, the appellant maintained at trial that the maximum fine in
    lieu of forfeiture would be $103,500. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The trial judge found as a fact that the
    appellant’s direction to the complainants to pay third parties constituted part
    of the fraud. On that basis, she agreed with the Crown that the total amount
    defrauded from the complainants who testified at trial was $413,500.  She
    reasoned, though, that any fine in lieu of forfeiture had to be considered in
    the context of the “entire punishment.” She found that the fine had to be “proportionate”
    because “it is a component of the punishment.” As the appellant was receiving a
    sentence in the “mid-range” for the fraud (four years custody) and a $109,150
    restitution order, the trial judge determined that a fine in lieu of forfeiture
    in the same amount as the restitution order was appropriate. Accordingly, she
    imposed a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the amount of $109,150.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The trial judge refused to deduct any
    amounts from that fine in lieu of forfeiture. Although she acknowledged that the
    appellant had repaid a couple of the victims, those payments had been made from
    commingled property the appellant received from those and other victims. Consequently,
    the payments arising from the conclusion of civil proceedings were not taken
    into account. The appellant was given six years from the date of release from
    custody to repay the fine. </span></p>
  <h3><em>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></em><em> The Parties’ Positions on Appeal</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Crown maintains that the trial
    judge erred by applying sentencing principles to the fine in lieu of
    forfeiture. Having determined the value of the fraud, the Crown argues that the
    trial judge was duty bound to impose a fine in lieu of forfeiture in an equal amount.
     </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant argues that the trial
    judge imposed too heavy a fine in lieu of forfeiture. He points to a few errors
    in the chart used by the trial judge to calculate the total amount of the
    fraud. In light of those alleged errors, and in light of his argument that the
    fine should not include complainants’ money flowing to third parties, he maintains
    in this court that the most he should have been ordered to pay as a fine in
    lieu of forfeiture was $96,150, a slightly reduced amount from what he
    acknowledged at the sentencing hearing as his maximum exposure. He also
    contends that the fine in lieu of forfeiture should be decreased by the amount
    of $72,000 to reflect his payment of a complainant arising from a default judgment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Crown counsel on appeal fairly
    acknowledges the errors in the chart used at the sentencing proceeding. That
    position leaves the Crown on appeal suggesting that the defrauded funds total
    $403,750, and there should be a fine in lieu of forfeiture in that amount. Crown
    counsel does not agree that the $72,000 payment should be deducted from that
    amount. </span></p>

class=MsoPageNumber>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In light of the Crown concessions, the parties
    are apart on only two issues that this court must resolve: (a) should the fine
    in lieu of forfeiture have taken into account the funds that the complainants
    transferred to third parties; and (b) should the $72,000 be deducted from the
    fine in lieu of forfeiture. </span></p>

    that the trial judge erred in her approach to determining the amount of fine in
    lieu of forfeiture. I will then address why I conclude that in the context of this
    Ponzi-type scheme, the funds that went from the complainants to third parties
    should be included in the fine in lieu of forfeiture. I will conclude by
    addressing why I find that the payment of $72,000 should not be deducted from
    the total fine in lieu of forfeiture. </span></p>

    that cannot be divided without difficulty. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Although pursuant to s. 673, forfeiture
    and fine in lieu of forfeiture orders are technically part of a “sentence”,
    they are not to be considered in the context of the principle of totality. As
    this court held in <i>R. v. Saikaley, </i>2017 ONCA 374, at para. 181, leave to
    appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 284, a fine in lieu of forfeiture is not
    punishment or part of the global sentence to be imposed upon the offender and,
    accordingly, “it is not to be consolidated with sentencing on a totality
    approach”. Forfeiture and fine in lieu of forfeiture orders are not a means by
    which to punish offenders, but a means by which to replace the proceeds of
    crime: <i>Lavigne, </i>at para. 25. As noted in <i>Lavigne, </i>at para. 26,
    the “objective of Part XII.2 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>is to deal with the
    proceeds of crime separately from, and in addition to, the punishment for
    committing a crime.” While a term of imprisonment flows from a failure to pay
    without reasonable excuse, that term of imprisonment is a means by which to
    enforce the fine, not to punish the offender for the designated offence:  <i>Khatchatourov, </i>at paras. 55-56. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The error in this case arose from the
    trial judge having considered the fine in lieu of forfeiture as part of the
    sentence to be imposed. Attempting to align it with the mid-range sentence she
    had chosen was in error. Forfeiture does not fall within a “range”. It is not
    meant to be measured by the gravity of the offence or the moral blameworthiness
    of the offender. Property that is found to be the proceeds of crime must be
    forfeited. Having found that the value of property being the proceeds of crime
    was $413,500, if that money had been available for forfeiture, the trial judge would
    have been duty bound to order it forfeited. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Where the proceeds of crime are no
    longer available to be forfeited, the sentencing judge must determine whether a
    fine should be imposed in lieu of that forfeiture. Once that determination is
    made, the sentencing judge determines the value of the property that would have
    been forfeited had it still been available for that purpose. Once that value is
    determined, then the statute governs how to calculate the fine in lieu of
    forfeiture. As Deschamps J. held in </span><em>Lavigne, </em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>at para. 34, the statute is “crystal clear”, the fine is
    “equal to the value of the property”. Because the fine takes the place of the
    forfeiture, the fine must be of an equivalent value: <i>Lavigne, </i>at para.
    35.</span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Given that the property was not
    available to forfeit in this case, and having chosen to impose a fine in lieu
    of forfeiture, the trial judge was duty bound to impose a fine equal to the
    value of the property. Having determined that the value of the property was
    $413,500, an amount that the Crown now concedes is only $403,750, the trial
    judge should have imposed a fine in that amount.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant maintains, though, that the trial judge erred
    in her original calculation of what should be taken into account as
    constituting the proceeds of crime in this case. The appellant emphasizes that,
    in order to constitute the proceeds of crime, the property must have been in
    his possession or control at some point: <i>Dwyer, </i></span>at paras. 21, 24.
    He contends that the funds that went to third parties were never in his
    possession or control and, therefore, he cannot be held accountable for them
    from a forfeiture perspective. I disagree. </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:normal'><em>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></em><em> Should the money that
    went to third parties have been excluded from the fine in lieu of forfeiture?</em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>As previously reviewed, the appellant
    acknowledges that the money that he received from the complainants by way of
    cash, cheques made directly to him and cheques made to him in trust, should
    factor into the amount of fine in lieu of forfeiture. He disputes that the
    funds that went to third parties should form part of that calculus. Those funds
    travelled to third parties in two different ways. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>First, at the appellant’s request, some
    complainants gave him cheques with the payee left blank. Although the
    complainants testified about the oddity of those requests, the appellant would
    always give them a reason that it had to be done that way. The appellant would
    later fill in the names of third parties and provide the cheques to those
    parties to be cashed. In some cases, those third parties were other
    complainants. When the complainants who provided the money received their cancelled
    cheques back, they would sometimes ask the appellant about the identity of the
    third party who had cashed their cheques. He would give them different answers.
    For instance, he would sometimes tell the concerned complainants that they had
    bought that third parties’ shares in a company. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Second, at the appellant’s request, the
    complainants would sometimes write cheques made out to third parties. Inquiries
    about why they needed to pay someone whom they did not know would spawn answers
    similar to the last, that the third party was someone who was interested in
    selling shares to the complainant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In both cases, the benefit to the
    appellant was the same. The appellant had multiple balls in the air all at
    once. His initial fraudulent conduct led to the taking of money from
    unsuspecting friends, clients and acquaintances who thought that they were
    making investments. He deposited a lot of that money directly into his own
    personal bank account. To keep the scheme going for over eight years, he needed
    to keep the wolves at bay. When investors eventually became suspicious, he had
    to find money to pay them off. Through further fraudulent conduct, he would
    find new investors to do so. Those new unsuspecting investors would sometimes
    give the appellant blank cheques that would go to third parties and they would
    sometimes make those cheques out directly to the third parties. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>This had elements of a Ponzi scheme,
    described by <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i> (10th ed., 2014), and cited
    approvingly by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, in <i>LLS America LLC
    (Trustee of) v. Dill</i>, 2018 BCCA 86, 8 B.C.L.R. (6th) 1, at para. 11, as:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>A
    fraudulent investment scheme in which money contributed by later investors
    generates artificially high dividends for the original investors, whose example
    attract even larger investments. Money from the new investors is used directly
    to repay, or pay interest to old investors, usually without any operation or
    revenue-producing activity other than the continual raising of new funds. This
    scheme takes its name from Charles Ponzi, who in the late 1920's was convicted
    for fraudulent schemes he conducted in Boston.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant did not
    necessarily pay “dividends” but that distinction is not material here. The core
    of the fraud was that the appellant was not actually investing the money on
    behalf of his clients. He was misappropriating it, and when certain clients
    became suspicious and demanded a return of their money, he effected this not
    through liquidating an actual investment (none existed), but by
    misappropriating more funds from more clients. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant contends that he was
    never in possession or control of those third party monies and, therefore,
    should not be required to pay a fine in lieu of forfeiture when it comes to
    those funds. I disagree. The appellant was entirely in control. He was the
    directing mind of the fraud and of each individual payment. He controlled the writing
    of the blank cheques and redirecting them to pay his debt to third parties. He
    was also the one who was directing complainants to pay third parties. He took
    physical possession of the cheques and delivered them to the third parties. He
    did all of this under false pretences. He was in control of the transactions
    and the money was all the “proceeds of crime” as defined within s. 462.3. The
    appellant obtained an obvious benefit and advantage from that money that flowed
    to third parties, money that was “obtained or derived directly or indirectly”
    as a result of the Ponzi-type scheme. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant wanted to keep the fraud
    alive as long as possible. The longer it went, the more he could benefit from
    it. The whole scheme would come crashing down if the earlier investors who had developed
    suspicions had made a complaint to the regulator or the police. The appellant
    needed to make good on those debts in order to keep things quiet. Who did he
    get to pay his debt? New complainants. What was his benefit? The continuation
    of his fraud, avoiding detection, and the ability to continue to take as much
    money as he could. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Nor should any of the individual
    payments be deducted from the fine in lieu of forfeiture on the basis that the
    appellant was defrauding one investor while making another whole. How the
    appellant decided to benefit from the proceeds of crime he controlled need not
    be the subject of the inquiry by the sentencing judge: <i>R. v. A.S.</i>, 2010
    ONCA 441, 258 C.C.C. (3d) 13, at para. 14. The amount of the fine is required
    to be equal to the value of the property which was possessed or controlled by
    the appellant, not the value of the benefit received by the appellant: <i>Lavigne</i>,
    at para. 34; <i>R. v. Piccinini</i>, 2015 ONCA 446, at paras. 18-19; <i>R. v.
    Siddiqi, </i>2015 ONCA 374, at para. 6.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Accordingly, I conclude that the fine
    in lieu of forfeiture must include the money that went to third parties. I
    agree with Crown counsel’s concessions regarding the minor errors made in
    calculating that amount by the trial Crown below. I find that the amount that
    should have been subject to forfeiture is $403,750. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>This leaves the issue of whether the
    $72,000 paid to a complainant as a result of a civil judgment should be
    subtracted from the amount of the fine in lieu of forfeiture. </span></p>
  <h3><span class=MsoPageNumber>(v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber> Should
    the fine in lieu of forfeiture be discounted from the total?</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In this court, the appellant maintains
    that whatever the amount of fine in lieu of forfeiture, it should be decreased
    by $72,000. That is the amount that the appellant was ordered to pay to Mr.
    Dollenkamp after the appellant failed to defend against a civil action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber> Crown counsel does not dispute that
    the payment was made, or that it was appropriately deducted from the amount of
    restitution the appellant was required to pay. Rather, Crown counsel maintains
    that the appellant should not be credited that amount toward an otherwise
    appropriate fine in lieu of forfeiture because he paid that money from funds
    that had been commingled with other complainants’ money. Specifically, the
    Crown maintains that a great deal of the money arising from the fraudulent
    scheme went directly into the appellant’s personal bank account that was being
    used to pay his mortgage. After the charges had been laid, the home where the
    appellant lived with his wife was transferred into her name and was then
    refinanced. During the sale, $72,000 of the proceeds was used to discharge a
    lien that had been secured by Mr. Dollenkamp to satisfy the judgment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>For the reasons given above, I would
    not reduce the fine in lieu of forfeiture. I defer to the trial judge’s finding
    of fact that the payment to Mr. Dollenkamp came from commingled funds. It was
    not the appellant’s money that paid Mr. Dollenkamp, but the commingled funds of
    complainants and other victims not before the court that furnished that
    payment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>In the context of this Ponzi-type
    scheme, the use of complainants’ funds to pay complainants does not reduce the
    amount of property that constitutes the “proceeds of crime”. While paying the
    civil judgment properly reduced the amount of restitution owing to Mr.
    Dollenkamp, the sentencing judge was right to conclude that it should not
    reduce the fine in lieu of forfeiture. The value of the property that was in
    control of the appellant is the value to be attached to the fine. In this case,
    that is $403,750. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber> I would dismiss the conviction appeal.
    I would grant both parties leave to appeal sentence. I would dismiss the
    appellant’s sentence appeal, and grant the Crown’s sentence appeal. I would
    impose a restitution order in the amount of $17,000 to be paid toward Peter
    Edwards. I would impose a fine of $403,750 in lieu of forfeiture. All payments
    toward that fine shall first go toward paying the restitution orders, until
    those orders are fulfilled. Like the trial judge, I would grant the appellant
    six years following the expiration of any term of imprisonment to pay the fine.
    In default of payment of the fine, I would impose a further term of
    imprisonment of three years, to be served consecutively to any other term of
    imprisonment the appellant may then be serving. </span></p>
