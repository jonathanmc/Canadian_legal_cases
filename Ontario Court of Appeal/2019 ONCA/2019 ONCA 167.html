  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard: February 26, 2019</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on November 30,
    2016 and the sentence imposed on March 1, 2017 by Justice D. McLeod of the Ontario
    Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of luring a child for sexual purposes and
    sentenced to nine months in custody. He appeals the conviction, the trial
    judge’s dismissal of his 11(b) application and the sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that all three of the trial judge’s decisions are
    defective. He argues that – in addition to errors of law - they are tainted by
    a series of missteps by the trial judge followed by unsatisfactory explanations
    which in turn led to inordinate delays between the hearings and the decision. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he rendered his oral reasons for conviction, the trial judge explained
    that his reasons were “somewhat fragmented” because he had encountered computer
    issues and was essentially going from rough notes. The appellant says that the
    resulting reasons were fragmented and not capable of appellate review. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was one issue at trial: did the appellant send the impugned
    messages to the complainant. The complainant’s credibility was not in issue. It
    was acknowledged that the messages were received. The content fully supported
    the charges. The trial judge explained why he was satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant had sent the messages. That explanation included a
    detailed and reasoned rejection of the appellant’s denial. In these
    circumstances, the reasons are satisfactory. </p>
  <p class=Heading>11(b) Application</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 11(b) application was argued on October 20, 2017. The trial judge
    dismissed the application without reasons on January 5, 2018. In May 2018
    counsel were asked to provide replacement factums to the court as the originals
    had been inadvertently destroyed. The written reasons were sent to the parties
    on July 6, 2018. The appellant submits that the request for the factums coupled
    with eight month delay between argument and release of reasons compromise the
    integrity of the reasoning process. He argues that the reasons reflect a
    justification for his earlier decision, not a reasoned analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree. The trial judge meticulously charted the time from
    charge to conviction and we see no basis to infer that the reasons were
    compromised because of the delay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further submits that the trial judge erred by dismissing
    the application. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, we do not agree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    information was sworn on January 9, 2015. The verdict was rendered on November
    30, 2016. Six months before the verdict, <em>Jordan</em> was released. The
    trial judge determined that the 23 months from charge to verdict should be
    reduced by 10 months to 13 months as a result of defence delay caused by
    adjournments and unavailability. We see no error in his analysis, which
    resulted in a net delay to verdict of 13 months. This is 5 months under the <a
name="_Hlk2183755"><em>Jordan</em></a><em> </em>ceiling. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    post-verdict delay from November 30, 2016 to the sentencing decision on January
    15, 2018 is a period of 13 months. There were four months attributable to
    defence delay arising from the 11(b) application leaving a net delay of nine
    months. Even if the <em>Jordan </em>ceiling is applied to the entire time from
    charge to sentence, the case is only four months over the presumptive ceiling.
    However, the first 17 months of the pre-verdict time was when the parties were
    operating under the previous framework. Applying the transitional provisions in
    context, the time to sentence does not markedly exceed what was reasonably
    required. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Sentence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellant that the sentencing reasons are problematic. The trial
    judge orally imposed a nine months’ sentence; the reasons – six months later -
    imposed 10 months. The trial judge gave no consideration to the mitigating
    factor of strict house arrest which were bail conditions for a considerable
    time. Although he relied on <em>Morrisson </em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>which</span></em> sentenced the offender to 75 days, he did not
    distinguish it. That said, we agree with the trial judge’s comments that the
    appellant, in a position of trust with the complainant, was in a position to
    “fast track” his requests of a sexual nature. This was an aggravating factor.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown fairly concedes that this court could approach the sentence <em>de novo</em>.
    In all the circumstances and as a matter of fairness we reduce the sentence to six
    months. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Summary</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction appeal is dismissed. The sentence appeal is allowed and the sentence
    is reduced to six months. </p>
