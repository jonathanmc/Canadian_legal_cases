  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice

  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of repeatedly communicating by way of
    telecommunication with intent to harass contrary to s. 372(4) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, breach of recognizance, and breach of probation. He received a
    sentence of 20 months’ imprisonment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals the convictions. His principal submission is that
    the conviction for the communicating offence is unreasonable. Hence the appeal
    should be allowed, the conviction set aside, and an acquittal entered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Saturday, January 30, 2016, four Carleton University students,
    including the complainant, L.M., and her friend, S.C., went to a bar in
    Gatineau called Mardi Gras. While at Mardi Gras, L.M. spoke to S.C. about her
    interest in another student, Brandon, who was also at Mardi Gras. According to
    S.C., a man whom she identified at trial as the appellant overheard the
    conversation and offered to assist in hooking L.M. up with Brandon. The man
    introduced himself to S.C. as “Cody”. S.C. and “Cody” chatted briefly. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At some point, “Cody” chatted with L.M. During this conversation, “Cody”
    and L.M. discussed how they would work out at the Carleton University gym and
    how L.M. liked to do squats. They agreed to work out together at the gym at
    some point. They also exchanged cell phone numbers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>L.M. spent most of the time at Mardi Gras dancing with Brandon, while
    “Cody” danced with her friend Lindsay. After about an hour at Mardi Gras, L.M.,
    Brandon, “Cody”, Lindsay and S.C. went to another bar, Le Pub. S.C. stayed at
    Le Pub until closing time. At approximately midnight, L.M., Brandon, “Cody” and
    Lindsay decided to go to the Gatineau casino. Prior to leaving, “Cody” made a
    comment to L.M. that she could either go home with Brandon or with him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Cody” drove everyone to the casino. The couples (Brandon and L.M. and
    “Cody” and Lindsay) separated at the casino but met up less than an hour later
    to go home. “Cody” drove everyone back to his place. Brandon and L.M. stayed
    there for approximately ten minutes then went home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At some point the next day, Sunday, January 31, 2016, L.M. began
    receiving text messages from the cell phone number she had assigned to “Cody”
    in her cell phone. “Cody” referred to L.M. as “squat girl”, discussed working
    out with her in the future, mentioned that he was hungover, and asked her if
    she had fun with Brandon the other night. “Cody” also made suggestive remarks
    and attempted to arrange a meeting with L.M. Eventually the conversation took a
    negative turn and “Cody” started sending aggressive, insulting, and belittling
    messages to L.M. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upset, L.M. showed the messages to S.C. S.C. then began exchanging
    messages with “Cody”. The messages sent by “Cody” continued to be aggressive,
    insulting, and belittling. Later, L.M. and S.C. received insulting and
    belittling messages from an email address they did not recognize. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On Tuesday, February 2, 2016, L.M. and S.C. met with Carleton University
    security. They then contacted the police to report the messages. The appellant
    was arrested and charged with repeatedly communicating with L.M. by means of
    telecommunication, with intent to harass L.M., contrary to s. 372(4) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. He was also charged with breaching two probation orders and one
    recognizance applying to him at the time. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    key issue at trial was identification: was the appellant, Cody Boast, the
    “Cody” who met the complainant and then, a day later, sent her harassing
    messages?  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    landscape on this appeal is the same. The sole issue is identification. The
    appellant submits that the testimony of the complainant and her friend S.C. was
    insufficient to conclusively establish that the appellant was the person who
    sent the harassing messages to the complainant, either directly or through S.C.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission. In our view, the trial judge’s analysis of, and
    conclusion about, the identification evidence were error-free. The trial judge
    properly considered the complainant’s evidence to be recognition evidence.  Her
    identification of the appellant was unquestionably based on their prior
    acquaintance.  The evidence established that the complainant and the appellant
    were together for several hours on the night of January 30-31, 2016. Although
    they had never met before, by the end of the evening they had been in close
    proximity for several hours in two or three bars and casinos, outside when the
    appellant suggested to the complainant that she could go home with him or
    Brandon in the appellant’s car, and in his home. They had also exchanged cell
    phone numbers and agreed to meet again at a university gymnasium. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the trial judge’s approach to the complainant’s description to police contained
    no error. It was a detailed and accurate description. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the trial judge did not err in relying on the complainant’s out-of-court
    Internet identification. Both this identification and the complainant’s
    in-court identification of the appellant were, at bottom, anchored in the
    lengthy contact, in close quarters and across several locations, between the
    complainant and the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, the complainant’s identification of the appellant was not based on a
    fleeting glance at a person in a stressful situation (the context for many
    identifications in criminal trials). It was not an identification of a
    stranger. The trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am satisfied that, after the interactions with Cody on
    Saturday night and early Sunday morning, both [the appellant] and [S.C.] had a
    clear image of him. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Cody Boast is
    the Cody whom [S.C.] and [the appellant] met at Mardi Gras on January 30, 2016.
    I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 613-240-7551 was the cell
    phone number that Mr. Boast gave [the appellant] on January 30, 2016 so that
    she could contact him from her cell phone number. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    can see no basis for interfering with this analysis and conclusion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed. </p>
