  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of internet luring of a person he believed
    to be under the age of 16 years, contrary to s. 172.1(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, and transmitting sexually explicit material to
    a person he believed to be under the age of 16 years, contrary to s.
    171.1(1)(b). The latter count was conditionally stayed on the basis of <em>R.
    v. Kienapple</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The appellant was sentenced to 18
    months’ imprisonment, three years’ probation, and was made subject to other
    ancillary orders, discussed below. He appeals both his conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November of 2014, the appellant placed two ads on Craigslist, one
    entitled “Any Young girls??? – m4w (Chatham)” and the other “Daddy’s Dirty Slut
    – m4w – 55 (Chatham)”. In late November, an undercover police officer, posing
    as a 14-year-old girl named “Katie”, made contact with the appellant. They
    exchanged many messages. In his exchanges with “Katie”, the appellant often
    steered the direction of the conversation to sexually explicit matters.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After exchanging messages over the course of a couple of months, a
    meeting was arranged for March 10, 2015. The appellant suggested meeting at his
    house. They eventually settled on a public library as the meeting spot. As they
    were working out the details of their meeting, “Katie” said that she was hungry
    and asked the appellant to bring her some food. The appellant offered a bologna
    or peanut butter and jelly sandwich. “Katie” said that either was fine. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly afterwards, the appellant left his home and walked to the
    library to meet “Katie”. In the meantime, a young-looking female officer was
    recruited to play the role of “Katie”. She wore a black coat, with grey and
    pink shoes, as “Katie” said she would. As the appellant walked towards the
    officer, he was arrested. In his bag, the police found a peanut butter and
    jelly sandwich, a juice box, a marijuana cigarette, and other items. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his testimony, the appellant said that, by posting his ads on
    Craigslist, he was not actually seeking young girls the age of “Katie”.
    Moreover, when he was contacted by “Katie”, he knew that he was dealing with a
    middle-aged man. He said that he played along, indulging this man’s fantasy of
    pretending to be a young girl engaged in a sexualized chat with an older man.
    The appellant said that his exchanges with “Katie” were unimportant to him,
    forming a low percentage of the considerable time he spent online. He gave many
    reasons in support of his stated belief that he was dealing with a middle-aged
    man and offered explanations for the numerous pieces of incriminatory evidence
    against him. By way of example, he said he went to the library on March 10,
    2015 to meet “Katie” because he was going to return a library book in any
    event. The appellant said that the sandwich in his bag was for himself; he
    planned to eat it in a nearby park, after he had returned his book. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave extensive reasons for judgment, finding the
    appellant guilty on both counts. She rejected the appellant’s evidence as being
    unworthy of belief and provided detailed reasons for doing so. The trial judge
    instructed herself on the burden of proof and reasonable doubt, citing <em>R.
    v. W.(D.),</em> [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. At para. 6 of her reasons, she made the
    following finding:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I find that the accused’s testimony is neither worthy of
    belief, nor capable of raising a reasonable doubt. It appears to me that the
    accused set out to reconstruct history in an effort to escape criminal
    liability. His account was contrived and implausible. His explanations defy
    credulity. His testimony cannot be reconciled with what he did and said at the
    time of the offence.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><b>The Conviction Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in the manner in which
    she dealt with his evidence. The trial judge analyzed the appellant’s evidence
    concerning the sincerity of his belief in “Katie’s” age under 11 separate
    headings, each corresponding to an aspect of the appellant’s evidence. The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred by analyzing these items in a
    piecemeal fashion, and by not considering whether, as a whole, his evidence
    raised a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. The trial judge’s analysis was responsive to the evidence.
    It was probing of the appellant’s account. Her decision to reject the
    appellant’s evidence enveloped a consideration of his evidence as a whole. As
    the trial judge said, at para. 74:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For all of the above reasons, I find that the accused believed
    Katie to be under the age of 16 years. The inference is inescapable on the
    whole of the evidence, even absent operation of the statutory presumption.
    Nothing in the accused’s testimony, or any other evidence, raises a reasonable
    doubt on that issue. It has been proven by the crown on the criminal standard
    of proof.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The trial judge gave fair consideration
    to the appellant’s evidence. She was entitled to conclude that his evidence was
    unworthy of belief (especially given his willingness to attend the meeting on
    March 10, 2015) and could not raise a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant submits that the trial
    judge improperly took judicial notice of certain factors to rebut some of the
    assertions made by the appellant in his evidence. This included the workings of
    computer spellcheck software, the grammatical habits of young people, their
    preference for metric over imperial forms of measure, and the common usage of
    the term “girl”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>We are not persuaded that the trial
    judge erred in this manner. There was an evidentiary foundation for the
    conclusions that the trial judge reached on the important aspects of these
    items, rendering her references to personal experience superfluous. Moreover, her
    conclusions were otherwise based on common sense.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>Lastly, the appellant takes issue with
    the trial judge’s reference to the word “concocted” when considering the
    appellant’s evidence. This occurred once in a 38 page judgment. The trial judge
    used this term in sizing up the appellant’s credibility. By deploying this
    descriptor, she did not engage in any forbidden reasoning. She did not
    improperly transform her rejection of the appellant’s evidence into positive
    proof of guilt. There is no merit to this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appeal from conviction is
    dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span class=MsoPageNumber><b>The Sentence Appeal</b></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant has served the custodial
    portion of his sentence. He submits that his 3 year probation order should be
    shortened because his prison term was unfit. Without commenting on the fitness
    of the custodial portion of the appellant’s sentence, we have not been provided
    with any compelling reason for reducing the length of the probation order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant requests that, in light
    of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in </span><em>R. v. Boudreault</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2018 SCC 58, 50 C.R. (7th) 207, the mandatory $200 victim
    surcharge imposed by the trial judge should be set aside. The respondent does
    not oppose this request. Accordingly, we set aside the victim surcharge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    trial judge erred by holding that the imposition of a weapons prohibition under
    s. 109 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> was
    mandatory in this case. Section 109(1)(a) provides for such a prohibition
    where, among other things, “a person is convicted of an indictable offence in
    the commission of which violence against a person was used, threatened or
    attempted.” </span></p>

    counsel (not Ms. Ohler) did not oppose this order. Ms. Ohler contends that
    defence counsel was taken by surprise when the trial judge said, during
    submissions, that such an order is mandatory. It is not apparent from the
    transcript that defence counsel was surprised; he simply agreed with the trial
    judge.</span></p>

    was mandatory. The appellant was found guilty of two offences, both of which
    involved conduct “for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence
    under Sections 151, 152 or 271” of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>. In </span><em>R. v. Alicandro</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2009 ONCA 133, 95 O.R. (3d) 173, leave to appeal refused,
    [2009] S.C.C.A. No. 395, Doherty J.A. discussed the nature of s. 172.1 of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span class=MsoPageNumber> in the following way, at paras. 19-20:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>Before examining the specific
    language of s. 172.1(1)(c), it is helpful to consider s. 172.1 on a more
    general level. The crimes created by that section target a specific kind of
    conduct, the communication by means of a computer with a person who is, or is
    believed to be, below a certain age. That conduct is not in and of itself
    criminal, illegal, or necessarily inappropriate. <u>The section criminalizes that
    conduct only if it is accompanied by the intention to facilitate the commission
    of one of the crimes designated in s. 172.1. All those designated crimes are
    crimes against young persons and all potentially involve the sexual
    exploitation of young people.</u></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber><u>By criminalizing conduct that is
    preparatory to the commission of the designated offences, Parliament has sought
    to protect the potential child victims of those designated crimes by allowing
    the criminal law to intervene before the actual harm caused by the commission,
    or even the attempted commission, of one of the designated offences occurs</u>.
    Section 172.1 creates what Professor Ashworth refers to as essentially inchoate
    crimes, described in substantive offence terms: Andrew Ashworth, <i>Principles
    of Criminal Law</i>, 5th ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), at pp.
    468-470. [Emphasis added.] [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>

    committed the offence under s. 172.1 – by going to the library to meet with
    someone he believed to be under 16 – satisfies the requirement of attempted
    violence in s. 109(1)(a). Whether s. 109(1)(a) applies to all scenarios caught
    by s. 172.1 is an issue we leave for another day.</span></p>
