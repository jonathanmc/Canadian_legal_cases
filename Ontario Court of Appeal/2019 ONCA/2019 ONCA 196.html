  <p class=Judge><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, Dirk Plate, appeals from the
    motion judge’s order granting the respondent, Atlas Copco Canada Inc., summary
    judgment in the amount of $20 million on its civil claim against the appellant
    for breach of fiduciary duty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was employed as the General
    Manager of the respondent’s Construction and Mining Technique (“CMT”) division
    and then promoted to the position of Vice President Global Strategic Customers.
    The respondent terminated his employment in 2007, and sued him in 2008,
    claiming he was involved in a scheme that defrauded the company.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The appellant was subsequently charged
    criminally. Following a trial by jury, he was convicted of defrauding the
    respondent of more than $5,000, contrary to s. 380(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. In the course of imposing sentence, the sentencing judge
    found that the appellant’s participation in the fraudulent scheme amounted to a
    “gross breach of his fiduciary duty” to the respondent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Relying solely on the criminal verdict and the
    findings of the sentencing judge in his Decision on Sentencing, the respondent
    moved for summary judgment in its civil action. The motion judge determined
    that the sentencing judge’s findings – including the finding that the appellant
    had breached a fiduciary duty owed to the respondent – were entitled to “very
    considerable weight” in the civil proceeding. He concluded that the appellant
    was a fiduciary of the respondent during the currency of the scheme because the
    sentencing judge had found the appellant to be a fiduciary, and because that
    finding was supported by the appellant’s title, his duties and the respondent’s
    vulnerability to the appellant, as described in the Decision on Sentencing. The
    motion judge held that the appellant had breached his fiduciary duty through
    his participation in the fraudulent scheme. Accordingly, he granted the respondent
    judgment for $20 million. The appellant appeals that order to this court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The key issue on appeal is whether the motion
    judge erred in granting summary judgment in sole reliance on the findings of
    the sentencing judge relative to breach of fiduciary duty. This raises three questions:
    (1) were the sentencing judge’s findings relative to breach of fiduciary duty
    admissible? (2) if so, did the motion judge err in giving “very considerable
    weight” to those findings (in particular the finding that the appellant was a
    fiduciary)? and (3) did he err in granting summary judgment based on the
    sentencing judge’s findings? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would allow the appeal and remit the matter
    back to the Superior Court of Justice for trial. As I will explain, the motion
    judge properly admitted the sentencing findings into evidence. However, he erred
    in principle by failing to consider relevant factors in determining what weight
    he could give to the sentencing judge’s finding that the appellant was a
    fiduciary. That error infected his analysis as to whether there was a genuine
    issue requiring a trial on the breach of fiduciary duty claim. </span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> Legal Proceedings</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2008, the respondent commenced a civil action
    against the appellant and other individuals alleged to have been involved in
    defrauding the respondent through a scheme involving the submission of “fake”
    or inflated invoices for employee benefit payments. The respondent asserted
    claims for fraud, conspiracy, unjust enrichment and, against the appellant and
    other former employees, breach of fiduciary duty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2012, the appellant was arrested and charged
    with theft, fraud and two counts of conspiracy. The indictment covered the
    period of 2001- 2007. The Crown ultimately proceeded against the appellant only
    on the fraud charge; all other charges were withdrawn.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One participant in the scheme, Leo Caron (the
    Human Resources Manager for all of the respondent’s divisions), pled guilty.
    Another participant in the scheme, David Hillier (the financial comptroller for
    the CMT division), was granted immunity from criminal prosecution in return for
    his testimony in both the criminal and civil proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was tried, alongside his
    co-accused, Paul Caron<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> (the respondent’s third-party broker for its insurance needs), in April 2016.
    At trial, the Crown’s position was that a criminal enterprise to defraud the
    respondent through the submission of entirely fake or deliberately inflated
    invoices for employee benefit payments had been in place for a number of years,
    with the total amount “overbilled” exceeding $20 million. The Crown alleged
    that the appellant had participated in the scheme while he was the General
    Manager of the CMT division in Sudbury, and that he had received at least
    $1,440,000 in annuities through his participation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s position at trial was that he
    was unaware of the fraud. Although he admitted receiving $1,440,000 in
    annuities between 2003 and 2006, he argued that the annuities had been
    authorized by the respondent and that the Crown had not proven beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the annuities were purchased with the proceeds of the
    fraud.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial lasted approximately 10 weeks. The
    jury found both the appellant and Paul Caron guilty. Neither appealed from his
    conviction. </span></p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The Decision on
    Sentencing</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the motion judge granted summary
    judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim in sole reliance on the factual
    findings made by the sentencing judge. Before turning to the Decision on
    Sentencing, it is helpful to briefly set out the legal context in which the
    sentencing findings were made. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 724 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> governs fact-finding for the purpose of sentencing. It distinguishes between

lang=EN>&nbsp;the prosecutor must establish, by proof beyond a reasonable

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>R. v. Ferguson</em>, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1
    S.C.R. 96, at paras. 17-18, the Supreme Court summarized the applicable
    principles where a sentencing judge must make factual findings to facilitate
    sentencing following a jury trial:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Two principles govern the sentencing judge in this endeavour.
    First, the sentencing judge &quot;is bound by the express and implied factual
    implications of the jury's verdict&quot;. The sentencing judge &quot;shall
    accept as proven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the
    jury's verdict of guilty&quot; (<em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 724(2)(<i>a</i>)),
    and must not accept as fact any evidence consistent only with a verdict
    rejected by the jury.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Second, when the factual implications of the jury's verdict are
    ambiguous, the sentencing judge should not attempt to follow the logical process
    of the jury, but should come to his or her own independent determination of the
    relevant facts. In so doing, the sentencing judge &quot;may find any other
    relevant fact that was disclosed by evidence at the trial to be proven&quot;
    (s. 724(2)(<i>b</i>)). To rely upon an aggravating fact or previous conviction,
    the sentencing judge must be convinced of the existence of that fact or
    conviction beyond a reasonable doubt; to rely upon any other relevant fact, the
    sentencing judge must be persuaded on a balance of probabilities: ss. 724(3)(<i>d</i>)
    and 724(3)(<i>e</i>). It follows from the purpose of the exercise that the
    sentencing judge should find only those facts necessary to permit the proper
    sentence to be imposed in the case at hand. The judge should first ask what the
    issues on sentencing are, and then find such facts as are necessary to deal
    with those issues. [Citations omitted.]</p>

  <p class=CQuote>[The appellant] was <span class=Underline>highly trusted</span> by [the respondent]. He was in charge of its Canadian CMT operations, and,

    best position to stop the scheme had wished to do so. He took advantage of the
    fact that Leo Caron and the employee benefits program spanned six divisions,
    which made it easier to conceal the overbilling. He and Leo Caron enticed David
    Hillier, who reported to [the appellant] as his comptroller, to join the

  <p class=CQuote>The Decision on Sentencing made specific findings that Mr.

    title during the relevant time frame (General Manager of CMT and then
    vice-president) and by such description as the Decision on Sentencing contains
    regarding his duties and the vulnerability of Atlas Copco to him.&nbsp;Mr.
    Plate has provided me with no evidence to negative that finding. </p>

lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge went on, at paras. 64-65, to
    find that the appellant had breached his fiduciary duty through his
    participation in, and “passive acquiescence” to, the fraudulent scheme:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:7.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> </span>The
    Decision on Sentencing found that Mr. Plate had specific knowledge of the
    existence of the fraud scheme and of how it worked.&nbsp;It found that he was
    in the best position to put a stop to it.&nbsp;It found that his passive
    acquiescence allowed the fraud to continue.&nbsp;However attenuated Mr. Plate’s
    degree of involvement in the fraud scheme may have been, the Decision on
    Sentencing found that Mr. Plate <i>was </i>involved to some degree.&nbsp;I
    attach no weight to Mr. Plate’s denial of such knowledge and conclude that the
    interest of justice do not require him to be given an opportunity at trial to
    persuade a different judge to reach a conclusion inconsistent with the one
    already reached by the Sentencing Judge after an adversarial criminal hearing. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I therefore find that Mr. Plate breached his fiduciary duty to
    his employer Atlas Copco.&nbsp;A fiduciary does not have the option of
    remaining mute in the presence of an identified, known scheme that is actively
    harming his employer.&nbsp;Still less is he entitled to accept benefits and

    inferred that the appellant’s breach of fiduciary duty occurred no later than

    sentencing judge found the net overbilling for the period of 2004-2007 was
    $22,336,335.38. The motion judge was satisfied that this amount reflected the <em>minimum</em><i> </i>of the respondent’s damages arising from the appellant’s breach of fiduciary
    duty. Against this amount, he gave the appellant credit for the amount of all
    of the annuities seized from the appellant, Hillier and Leo Caron (which was

    pronouncement after the contending parties [have] been heard” having a
    “substantial effect on their legal rights”: <em>Malik</em>,<i> </i>at para. 52.

    the summary judgment proceedings. He explained his reasoning, at paras. 30-31:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The fraudulent scheme pleaded in the statement
    of claim is the same fraudulent scheme described by [the sentencing judge] in

    relationship as the fiduciary duty about which [the sentencing judge] made
    findings of fact. There is very clearly a large overlap of issues between the
    civil and criminal proceedings even if all the issues in the one were not
    present in the other and vice versa.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[The appellant] was of course a party to both

    “participants” in the prior criminal proceedings, which raised similar or
    related issues.<i> <em>Mali</em>k</i> directs that lack of identity of issue
    goes to weight, not admissibility: at para. 43. At the sentencing proceedings,
    the extent of the appellant’s breach of trust was a relevant consideration,
    pursuant to s. 718.2(a)(iii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. It is in relation
    to this factor that the sentencing judge found the appellant to have breached a
    fiduciary duty to the respondent. Thus, the fact that the issues in the
    criminal proceedings were not identical to those in the civil proceeding did
    not operate as a bar to admissibility of the sentencing judge’s findings

    dismissed [2005] 1 S.C.R. xvii (note). A fiduciary relationship arises where:
    (1) there is an undertaking by the fiduciary to act in the best interests of
    the beneficiary; (2) the beneficiary is vulnerable to the fiduciary’s exercise
    of discretion or control; and (3) an identifiable legal or practical interest
    of the beneficiary stands to be adversely affected by the fiduciary’s exercise
    of discretion or control:<i> <em>Elder Advocates of Alberta Society v. Alberta</em></i>,
    2011 SCC 24, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 261, at para. 36. With respect to certain
    traditional, or <em>per se</em>, fiduciary relationships, these elements are
    presumed to exist. In other circumstances, they will arise on case-by-case, or <i>ad
    hoc</i>, basis: <em>Hodgkinson v. Simms</em>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377, at pp.

    the extent of the appellant’s breach of trust, arguing that the appellant was
    highly trusted by the respondent and grossly betrayed that trust. As noted
    above, pursuant to s. 718.2(a)(iii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> “evidence
    that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or
    authority in relation to the victim” is an aggravating factor on sentencing. Although
    a fiduciary relationship involves an element of trust, it has a distinct
    meaning at law from the term “position of trust” in s. 718.2(a)(iii): see <em>R.

    made the finding – contained in a single sentence in his Decision on Sentencing
    – that the appellant breached a fiduciary duty to the respondent. While the
    characterization of an individual as a fiduciary is a question of mixed fact
    and law, the sentencing judge did not have the benefit of legal submissions
    from the parties on that issue, and did not advert to any legal authority in
    his Decision on Sentencing on the test for imposing a fiduciary obligation, in
    finding the appellant to be fiduciary. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, because the finding that the appellant
    was a fiduciary was not express or implied in the jury’s verdict, but was made
    by the sentencing judge in the exercise of his fact-finding power under s.
    724(2)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, the appellant’s ability to appeal that
    finding was constrained significantly. The appellant could not contest the
    finding that he was a fiduciary by appealing his conviction; rather, he would
    be required to seek leave to appeal sentence. Given that it was uncontroverted
    that the appellant occupied a position of trust (which is an aggravating factor
    on sentencing), and in light of the deferential standard of review applicable
    to sentencing decisions on appeal, it is unlikely that contesting the
    sentencing judge’s finding that the appellant was a fiduciary would have had
    any practical effect on the sentence imposed. As a result, the appellant did
    not realistically have the opportunity to contest the sentencing judge’s
    finding that he was a fiduciary by way of appeal. In this way, this finding
    under s. 724(2)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>is different from a
    finding express or implied in a jury’s verdict of guilt, which could be
    contested by appealing conviction as of right. </span></p>

    para. 48. Here, the fiduciary question was not in play before the sentencing
    judge and the appellant did not have a realistic opportunity to challenge the
    fiduciary finding. The motion judge failed to consider these factors – factors
    that diminished the weight to be accorded to the finding that the appellant was

    evidence to negative the finding that he was a fiduciary. Thus, the motion
    judge does not appear to have treated the sentencing judge’s finding that the
    appellant breached a fiduciary duty as having acquired conclusive effect. </span></p>

    that the appellant was a fiduciary. The abuse of process doctrine is sensitive
    to the circumstances in which prior judicial determinations are made and the
    opportunity afforded to the prejudiced party to contest the relevant finding in
    the earlier proceedings: see e.g. <em>Intact Insurance Co. v. Federated

    not point to specific findings. I would note that the sentencing judge’s

    responsibilities as the General Manager of CMT. The sentencing judge noted that
    the appellant was the General Manager of the CMT division, that he was in
    charge of its Canadian CMT operations and that he was promoted to a global
    vice-presidency. He also noted that the appellant was Leo Caron’s direct
    supervisor and that Hillier reported to him. There is no mention of the

    was “vulnerable” to the appellant’s decision not to stop the fraud. However,
    vulnerability alone is insufficient to ground a fiduciary duty: <em>Elder
    Advocates</em>, at paras. 28, 36. The focus of the fiduciary relationship is an
    undertaking by the fiduciary to exercise a discretionary power to affect the
    legal or practical interests of the purported beneficiary; it is from this
    exercise of discretion or control that the “vulnerability” must arise:<i> <em>Galambos

    for calculating the damages if the appellant was not a fiduciary while he was

    a fair and just determination on the merits could be made on this summary
    judgment motion. In this unusual case, the respondent’s summary judgment motion
    cannot be saved by the inadequacy of the appellant’s responding evidence. Given
    my concerns about the weight that could be afforded to the sentencing judge’s
    finding that the appellant breached a fiduciary duty, the limited nature of the
    other evidence relied upon by the motion judge and the overall approach that he
    adopted on the summary judgment motion, I am not satisfied that the record
    before the motion judge positioned him to make the necessary factual and legal
    findings to either grant judgment to the respondent for breach of fiduciary
    duty in the amount of $20 million or to dismiss its claim for breach of
    fiduciary duty. </span></p>

    to defend the summary judgment motion; (2) erred by finding that “passive

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> The doctrine of abuse of process provides the

    28. Re-litigation inevitably has a detrimental effect on the due administration
    of justice, as it can lead to inconsistent results, devalue finality, and
    contribute to the unnecessary expenditure of public and private resources, with
    no guarantee that the second result will be more accurate than the first: <em>C.U.P.E.</em>,

lang=EN-US>The appellant also argues that by ordering damages in excess of the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>I disagree. The quantum of restitution ordered under s. 738(1)(a) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>and the assessment of damages for breach of
    fiduciary duty are guided by different principles. Since the sentencing judge
    and the motion judge were engaged in different exercises that were guided by
    different principles, the quantum of restitution ordered by the sentencing
    judge does not represent the “upper limit” of the damages that the motion judge
    could order for breach of fiduciary duty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge rejected the Crown’s request for a $22 million
    restitution order made jointly and severally against the appellant and Paul
    Caron, and instead made a restitution and forfeiture order against the
    appellant in favour of the respondent in respect of the annuities and the sum
    of $77,930. In doing so, the sentencing judge was guided by s. 738(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which permits a sentencing judge to order restitution
    to a victim of a crime in an amount not exceeding the value of the loss less
    the value of any amount already returned, where the amount is readily
    ascertainable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Restitution
    orders are discretionary in nature, and are intended to give effect to several
    sentencing principles, including the principle of rehabilitation. As a result,
    the impact of the proposed restitution order on the offender’s prospects for
    rehabilitation is a relevant factor: <em>R. v. Castro</em>, 2010 ONCA 718, 102
    O.R. (3d) 609, at para. 26; <em>R. v. Yates</em>, 2002 BCCA 583, 169 C.C.C (3d)
    506, at paras. 7, 11.</span><span lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>The offender’s
    ability to pay is also a relevant factor, though not the predominant factor in
    cases involving breach of trust: <em>Castro</em>, at para. 28; <em>Yates</em>,
    at paras. 12, 17. Where a restitution order is imposed in conjunction with a
    sentence of imprisonment, the entirety of the sentence must be consistent with
    the totality principle: <em>Castro</em>, at para. 23. The order need not be
    made for the full amount of a victim’s loss.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In crafting a restitution order, it is also relevant to consider
    whether civil proceedings have been initiated: <em>Castro</em>, at para. 24. As
    the appellant himself stated in his written submissions on sentencing, “a
    restitution order should be made with restraint and caution. The existing civil
    proceeding involving [the respondent and the appellant] is best capable of
    determining the amount of loss suffered attributable to the actions of [the
    appellant]”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    sentencing principles do not guide the court in providing a civil remedy for
    breach of fiduciary duty. <span lang=EN-US>Equitable compensation – as a form
    of fiduciary relief – is discretionary in nature: <em>Mady Development Corp v.
    Rossetto</em>, 2012 ONCA 31, 287 O.A.C. 277, at para. 18. The </span><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>fundamental measure of equitable
    compensation for breach of fiduciary duty is restitutionary; the injured
    beneficiary is entitled to be reimbursed for the losses flowing from the
    fiduciary’s breach, and to be put in the position it would have been in but for
    the breach: </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Hodgkinson</span></em><span lang=EN-US>,
    at p. 440. The court can consider the principles of remoteness, causation and
    intervening acts when necessary to achieve a fair and just result, but those
    principles should only be applied if doing so does not raise any policy
    concerns: <em>Waxman</em><i>,</i> at para. 662; <em>Hodgkinson</em>, at p. 443. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Further, s. 741.2 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>provides that

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As a result, while the damages that flow from the appellant’s
