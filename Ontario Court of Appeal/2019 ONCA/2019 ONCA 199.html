lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown appeals the nine-year sentence imposed
    on the respondent following his guilty plea to eight counts of sexual assault,
    eight counts of making child pornography and one count of possession of child
    pornography. The sexual assault and making child pornography offences were
    committed against young children under the respondent’s care in a daycare
    centre. The Crown argues that the sentence the trial judge imposed failed to
    satisfy the principle of totality, ran afoul s. 718.3(7) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-US> because consecutive
    sentences were not imposed on some counts, overemphasized some mitigating
    factors, and was demonstrably unfit. The Crown asks us to impose a sentence of
    15 years.</span></p>

    pornography investigation, the Peel Regional Police obtained a warrant and
    conducted a search of the respondent’s residence. The respondent’s computer was
    found to contain a massive amount of graphic and highly disturbing child
    pornography involving young prepubescent children, some in the form of still
    images and some in the form of videos. The police also found a folder labeled
    “I Me Mine” containing close-up images and videos taken by the respondent of
    the genitals of eight female toddlers between the ages of two and three years.
    Some images revealed male fingers touching the genital area of the children. In
    an agreed statement of facts filed on the sentencing proceeding, the respondent
    admitted that during the toddler’s nap period when he was supervising them on
    his own, he pulled down their clothing and undergarments to expose their
    genitals and took close-up photographs with his phone while touching their
    genitals with one of his fingers. </span></p>

    years old, single and had no prior criminal record. He lived with his mother
    and had worked at several daycare centres as an early childhood educator for a
    number of years. He maintained that the children were asleep when he sexually
    assaulted them and he filed written apologies for his conduct. He admitted that
    he had an unhealthy affection for the children, that he was addicted to child
    pornography, and that he had become obsessed with acquiring more and more
    images. </span></p>

    real and palpable – emotional destruction of trust. The statements were riddled

    in oral argument before us, the Crown properly conceded that s. 718.3(7) is
    subject to the totality principle. Section 718.3(7) must be read together with
    s. 718.2(c) stating that “where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined
    sentences should not be unduly long or harsh.” In </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R.

    a sentence other than one of life imprisonment, imposed on a person for a
    terrorism offence, must be served consecutively to any other punishment imposed
    on the person “for an offence arising out of the same event or series of
    events”. This court, following the Supreme Court of Canada in </span><em>R. v.
    Khawaja</em>, 2012 SCC 69, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 555, <span lang=EN>stated, at para.
    79:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The totality principle is a particular
    application of the general principle of proportionality. It requires a
    sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for
    multiple offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not
    exceed the overall culpability of the offender. Following <i>M.(C.A.)</i>, the
    sentencing provisions in the <em>Criminal Code</em> were amended.
    Proportionality was included as the fundamental principle of sentencing (s.
    718.1) and sentencing courts were instructed to take into consideration the
    totality principle when imposing consecutive sentences to ensure that the
    combined sentence is not unduly long or harsh (s. 718.2(c)). The totality
    principle applies in sentencing persons convicted of terrorism offences.

    The trial judge was certainly alive to the possible application of 718.3(7) as
    the provision was the subject of detailed consideration in the sentencing

    the trial judge erred by placing reliance on <i>R. v. D.(D.). </i>In that case,
    this court upheld a sentence of nine years and one month for the sexual abuse
    of four young boys over a seven-year period. The offender had abused a position
    of trust with families, groomed the boys over a lengthy period, and regularly
    engaged in all manner of sexual activity including anal intercourse. He used
    violence and threats of violence to compel compliance and keep the boys quiet. Despite
    the differences in these crimes, the passage the trial judge quoted from </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>R. v D.(D.)</span></em><span lang=EN-US> was nevertheless pertinent
    to sentencing on sexual offences involving children. Further, given the gravity
    of the crimes committed in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R. v. D.(D</span></em><em>.</em><em><span

    this case calls for a longer sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the Crown that sentences for sexual
    offences involving young children and child pornography have been increasing:
    see </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R. v. J.S.</span></em><span lang=EN-US>; </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>R. v. L.M.</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> 2008 SCC 31, [2008] S.C.R. 163. However, I am satisfied that the
    nine-year sentence imposed by the trial judge is consistent with that pattern.
    The 18-year sentence upheld by this court in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>J.S.</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-US> </span></i><span lang=EN-US>post-dated the sentencing proceedings
    in this case and there are several distinguishing factors. First, that case
    involved an offender who recorded acts against his three infant nieces of
    attempted anal and vaginal penetration with an erect penis, digital
    penetration, penetration with a marker, digital masturbation and cunniligus.
    That conduct is even more disturbing than the conduct at issue here. Second,
    that case did not involve this court overturning a sentence imposed at trial
    and it is clear from the court’s reasons that deference to the sentencing
    discretion of the trial judge was a primary factor. Third, the court observed,
    at para. 123, that the 18-year sentence was “at the high end of the range for
    such offences, and possibly in excess of the range” but that it was not the
    product of an error in principle. The refusal of this court to set aside the 18-year
    sentence does not establish 18 years as a benchmark for future cases. </span></p>

    determining that certain factors were mitigating, citing the following
    paragraph from his reasons: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[S.C.] is a first-time offender. He has [</span><em>sic</em><span
lang=EN-US>] the court time, and resources have been saved. He appears to be a
    good candidate for rehabilitation and none of the victims suffered physical
    injury or required mental treatment. No physical violence was used by [S.C.]
    during the course of the sexual assaults of the eight victims. There was no
    evidence that the downloads were unusually brutal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown submits that the lack of need for
    medical treatment is not a mitigating factor, that sexual assaults are
    inherently violent, and that while brutality can be an aggravating factor, the
    lack of brutality is not mitigating.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the passage quoted by the Crown must
    be read together with the immediately preceding paragraph where he refers to
    the aggravating factors.  In that paragraph he recites the massive amount of
    pornography found on the respondent’s computer, the fact that the assaults took
    place while the children were sleeping, that the respondent was in a position
    of trust, the number of victims and their young age and the potential for
    latent psychological damage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I have already referred to the passages from the
    trial judge’s reasons that indicate his awareness of the gravity of the
    offences. The Crown may be correct in pointing out that some of the points
    listed under the heading “mitigating factors” were not strictly speaking
    mitigating. However, they were relevant to the assessment of the gravity of the
    respondent’s conduct and, when read in the context of the reasons as a whole,
    do not reveal any legal error. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I add that there were significant mitigating
    factors. The respondent pleaded guilty thereby saving the victims, their
    families and the system the cost and trauma of a trial. The respondent was a
    first offender and he expressed remorse. He has faced the fact that he has a
    serious problem that needs to be addressed and he has expressed a willingness
    to undergo treatment. The institutional records filed as fresh evidence, which
    I would admit, indicate that he is ready and willing to follow programs that
    will assist in rehabilitation.</span></p>

    well established that sentencing decisions attract a high level of deference.
    Absent an error in principle or a failure to consider a factor relevant to an
    aggravating or mitigating factor, this court is not entitled to intervene</span>: <i>R. v. Lacasse</i>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at paras. 43-44<span
lang=EN-US>. The trial judge recognized that deterrence and denunciation were
    the primary sentencing objectives in this case. As a consequence, he imposed a
    very substantial penitentiary sentence of nine years. He did so to denounce the
    respondent’s conduct and to deter the respondent and others from committing
    offences against children in the future. That sentence took into account the
    gravity of the respondent’s conduct and moral culpability. The message the
    nine-year sentence sent is loud and clear. I am not persuaded that the longer </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>sentence
    sought by the Crown at trial and on appeal would appreciably add to the
    deterrent effect of the sentence that was imposed. A longer sentence could
    discourage guilty pleas and undermine the interest of rehabilitation. In my view,
    the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the sentence sought by the Crown
    would not be consistent with the principles of proportionality and totality. </span></p>
