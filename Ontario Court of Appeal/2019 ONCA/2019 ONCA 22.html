  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Megan Petrie, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Heard: January 9, 2019</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel style='text-align:justify'>On appeal from the convictions
    entered by Justice Gisele M. Miller of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting
    with a jury, on March 18, 2015, and from the sentence entered on June 24, 2015,
    with reasons reported at 2015 ONSC 4079.</p>
  <p class=Judge align=center style='text-align:center'><span style='font-size:
14.0pt;text-transform:uppercase;font-weight:normal'>Reasons for Decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his convictions for internet luring, sexual
    assault, sexual interference, and invitation to sexual touching involving A.C.,
    when she was 15 years old. He seeks leave to appeal his global sentence of five
    and one half years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was the second trial of the appellant on these charges. At the
    first trial before a judge alone, the appellant pleaded guilty to possession of
    child pornography and was convicted of offences arising from sexual activity with
    another complainant, H.M., for which he received a global sentence of four and
    one half years. He was acquitted of the offences involving A.C. The appellant’s
    appeal from his convictions involving H.M. was dismissed. The Crown appeal from
    the appellant’s acquittal was allowed, and a new trial was ordered on the
    charges respecting A.C.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant admittedly engaged in sexual activity first with H.M. and then
    with A.C. following the end of his relationship with H.M. He met them both on
    MocoSpace, an 18+ chat site. The complainants’ profiles listed their respective
    ages as 18. However, at the time of their relations with the appellant, H.M.
    was 14 and A.C. was 15 years old. The appellant was 38 years old. He testified
    at both trials that he honestly believed them to be between 16 and 18 years
    old. On retrial, the jury convicted him of all offences involving A.C.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits several grounds of appeal in relation to his
    convictions and sentence for the offences involving A.C. For the following reasons,
    we dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conviction appeal</h1>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;
line-height:normal'><span class=Heading2Char>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span class=Heading2Char>The trial judge did not err at the
    second trial involving A.C. in permitting the Crown to lead evidence relating
    to H.M. by way of an agreed statement of fact, nor was a limiting instruction
    required</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown brought a similar fact application for leave to lead detailed
    evidence concerning the appellant’s sexual relationship with H.M. The trial
    judge was concerned about the possibility of propensity prejudice and that the
    evidence would distract the jury from the essential issues that it was required
    to consider. As a result, she curtailed the permissible evidence to a short,
    agreed statement of fact relevant to the appellant’s knowledge, before he met
    A.C., that H.M. had lied about her age and he made no inquiries about her age
    on meeting her. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in including
    in the agreed statement of fact the appellant’s failure to make inquiries about
    H.M.’s age. The appellant submits that, particularly without a limiting instruction,
    there was a risk that the jury would misuse this evidence to conclude that the
    appellant had a specific propensity not to make these inquiries in these
    circumstances and did not do so in relation to A.C. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are not persuaded by these submissions. As this court noted in the
    appeal from the first trial, this evidence was relevant to the reasonable steps
    necessary for the appellant to take to confirm A.C.’s age, given his knowledge
    that H.M. had lied to him about her age in her MocoSpace profile before he had
    met A.C.: see <i>R. v. Saliba</i>, 2013 ONCA 661, 311 O.A.C. 196, at paras. 34
    to 36. The trial judge neutralized the risk of prejudice arising from the
    agreed statement of fact by omitting reference to H.M.’s age of 14 years, and
    to the appellant’s sexual activity with H.M. She also directed the jury to
    decide the case on the evidence and not to speculate. We would not interfere
    with the trial judge’s discretion to control and admit the evidence as she did.
    Her decision was appropriate and considered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did the trial judge err by not giving a limiting instruction. At the
    pre-charge conference, the trial judge expressly raised with counsel whether a
    limiting instruction should be given. Defence counsel was content with the
    charge without a limiting instruction and did not request that one be given. In
    the circumstances, the lack of a request by defence counsel to ask for the limiting
    instruction at trial reflects that its absence was not prejudicial. We see no
    error in the trial judge’s decision to admit the agreed statement of fact nor
    any trial unfairness or prejudice to the appellant that resulted from its
    admission.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><span
class=Heading2Char>The trial judge did not err in deciding to leave A.C.’s new
    allegations concerning non-consensual acts to the jury</span>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the first time at the second trial, A.C. testified that the
    appellant required her to engage, without her consent, in acts of oral sex and
    the insertion of a dildo into her vagina. No objection to the admission of this
    evidence was made by the appellant’s trial counsel who had elicited the
    evidence about the non-consensual oral sex during A.C.’s cross-examination.
    Rather, defence counsel used these new allegations to attack A.C.’s
    credibility. Defence counsel did not ask for a mistrial or an adjournment of
    the trial to consider these new allegations and did not indicate they would prejudice
    the calling of defence evidence. The appellant was examined and cross-examined
    on these allegations; he admitted the oral sex but said it was consensual and
    denied the dildo allegation. It was not until the pre-charge conference that
    defence counsel asked the trial judge to remove the new allegations from the
    jury’s consideration, which she refused to do. The trial judge held that the
    allegations fell squarely within the count of sexual assault and there was no
    prejudice to the appellant. We do not see any error in the trial judge’s
    exercise of her discretion to leave these allegations to the jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is there any basis for the appellant to argue that his fair trial rights were
    in any way affected by this. The appellant had the opportunity to respond to
    the allegations by way of cross-examination of A.C. and through his own evidence.
    Moreover, the sexual assault count was not particularized and fairly captured
    the allegations.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><span
class=Heading2Char>The trial judge did not err by entering convictions for the
    same offence</span>  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the two sexual interference counts should have been
    stayed pursuant to <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 because they
    involved the same acts as, and are subsumed under, the sexual assault count. In
    support of this submission, he points to the trial judge’s jury charge that
    referenced the same particularized acts for the two sexual interference counts and
    the sexual assault count.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept these submissions.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application of the well-established governing principles from <i>Kienapple</i> guards against multiple convictions for the same offence, where there is both a
    factual and a legal nexus connecting the offences. However, the decision in <i>Kienapple</i> does not prohibit a multiplicity of convictions, each in respect of a different
    factual incident: <i>R. v. Adjei</i>, 2013 ONCA 512, 309 O.A.C. 328 at para.
    70, leave to appeal refused, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 74, citing to <i>R. v. Prince</i>,
    [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, at p. 491.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there was a factual overlap in the nature of some of the uncontroverted sexual
    activities in which the appellant engaged with A.C., in our view, the evidence
    established clear and distinct factual and temporal instances of unconnected sexual
    activities occurring discretely over different periods of time. This evidence firmly
    and separately grounded the two sexual interference counts as well as the
    sexual assault count.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sexual assault and two sexual interference counts were particularized as
    occurring between February 1 and March 21, 2010. The sexual interference counts
    were further particularized: count 3 alleged that the appellant “touched A.C.
    directly with an object, a vibrator on her vagina” and count 4 alleged that “he
    touched A.C.’s vagina” with a part of his body.</p>

    and the appellant testified with respect to the various sexual activities they
    engaged in over the different and separate occasions on which they met: on
    March 6, 2010, the appellant kissed A.C. on the lips in his truck; on March 11,
    2010, they engaged in kissing and touching, and A.C. testified at the retrial
    that the appellant performed oral sex on her; on March 13, 2010, they engaged
    in kissing, oral sex, and A.C. testified that the appellant touched her vagina
    with a vibrator, which the appellant denied; and, during the March break, starting
    March 16, 2010, they engaged in all manner of sexual acts, including sexual
    intercourse and oral sex.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge declined to stay the sexual interference counts because she found,
    at para. 39 in her Reasons for Sentence, a factual distinction between them and
    the sexual assault count:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there were acts
    of sexual touching – licking and touching of A.C.’s body in places other than
    her vagina, the act of fellatio – that occurred which provide a factual
    distinction between the particularized counts of Sexual Interference and the
    all-encompassing count of Sexual Assault. I find there is a sufficient factual
    distinction that a conviction may be entered on all counts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion not to stay the
    sexual interference counts.  </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span

    appellant urges that the trial judge’s finding that some of the sexual acts
    were non-consensual is unreasonable, given the state of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. There was ample support in the record for the trial judge’s
    conclusion, which is entitled to deference. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also reiterates his complaint that the trial judge should have
    excluded A.C.’s evidence about the new non-consensual acts and not considered
    them for the purpose of sentencing. For the reasons already stated, we are of
    the view that the trial judge properly admitted evidence of the new
    non-consensual allegations. As a result, she was entitled to consider them, and
    it was open to her to find that the non-consensual nature of those acts was an
    aggravating factor on sentencing.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='text-align:justify;line-height:
normal'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><span
class=Heading2Char>The trial judge did not consider aggravating factors not
    proven beyond a reasonable doubt</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by holding the appellant’s
    “calculated grooming of A.C. is a seriously aggravating factor” without finding
    grooming beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The trial judge clearly found that the appellant groomed A.C. and her
    finding was firmly rooted in the ample evidence of the weeks of communications,
    gifts, and expressions of love and devotion in which the appellant engaged to
    obtain A.C.’s trust and prepare her for sexual activity with him. This included
    the dozens of communications which Crown counsel highlighted during her
    submissions that demonstrated how the appellant instigated all sexualized
    communications with A.C. and expressly and explicitly urged A.C. to prepare
    herself to receive and instigate sexual contact with the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that grooming cannot be an aggravating factor in this
    case because it is possible the jury accepted that the appellant honestly
    believed A.C. to be of legal age, but convicted him because he had not taken
    reasonable steps to confirm that belief. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. Even assuming that the appellant honestly believed that A.C. was
    between 16 and 18 years of age, the uncontroverted evidence establishes that
    she was a vulnerable, abused child whom he deliberately exploited, both emotionally
    and sexually. Moreover, if the basis of the appellant’s convictions was that he
    failed to take reasonable steps, it is nevertheless aggravating that he would fail
    to do so after exploiting a complainant’s vulnerability for sexual purposes. The
    trial judge was entitled to treat these circumstances as an aggravating factor
    on sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues further that the trial judge erred in treating A.C.’s willing
    participation in most of the sexual activity with the appellant as a breach of
    trust and an aggravating factor. We do not read the trial judge’s reasons in
    this way. Her point was not that A.C.’s willing participation was aggravating
    but it was aggravating for the appellant to cause A.C. to believe that they
    were in a loving relationship when she was being sexually exploited. As
    demonstrated by the sentencing submissions made by the appellant’s trial
    counsel, it was understood that the aggravating factor advanced by the Crown
    was the grooming behaviour through which the appellant attempted to gain A.C.’s
    trust in order to engage in sexual activity with her.  </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8 style='text-align:justify;'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><span class=Heading2Char>The trial
    judge did not treat weak mitigating factors as aggravating</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in considering his late expression
    of remorse and weak rehabilitative prospects as aggravating factors. We
    disagree. Reading the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, she properly considered
    these factors as indicating a lack of insight into the crimes that the
    appellant had committed and their effect on A.C., which was highly relevant to the
    appellant’s potential for future dangerousness: see <i>R. v. Shah</i>, 2017
    ONCA 872, at paras. 6-10.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><span class=Heading2Char>The sentence was fit</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no basis to interfere with the five-and-one-half-year global sentence
    imposed by the trial judge. The trial judge properly considered the principles
    of parity and totality. The appellant was convicted of multiple offences,
    including internet luring, which justified a consecutive sentence: see <i>R. v.
    Rayo</i>, 2018 QCCA 824, at paras. 130-156. The aggravating features of these
    offences are considerable and more serious than those involving H.M.: the
    appellant spent several weeks in deliberately grooming a particularly
    vulnerable 15-year-old child, who stated she had already been sexually abused
    and on whom the impact of the appellant’s calculated offences was significant
    and life-altering. As already noted, the appellant’s expression of remorse was
    late-breaking and his rehabilitative efforts and prospects weak.</p>
