  <p class=Judge><strong>Benotto J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The distinguishing feature of solitary
    confinement is the elimination of meaningful social interaction or stimulus. It
    has the potential to cause serious harm which could be permanent. Federal
    legislation permits its use in penitentiaries across Canada. It is called
    “administrative segregation” and is permitted to maintain safety and security
    or to conduct investigations. The appellant, the Canadian Civil Liberties
    Association (“CCLA”), submits that ss. 31-37 of the <em>Corrections and
    Conditional Release Act</em>, S.C. 1992, c. 20 (the “Act”), the legislative provisions
    authorizing administrative segregation, are unconstitutional. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The CCLA was partially successful in the
    Superior Court. The application judge found that the legislation authorizing administrative
    segregation violates s. 7 of the <em>Canadian Charter</em> <em>of Rights and
    Freedoms </em>because it does not provide for an independent review of the
    decision to place an inmate in administrative segregation. The respondent, the Attorney
    General of Canada (“AGC”), does not challenge this finding on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the CCLA argues that ss. 31-37 of the
    Act violate s. 12 and s. 11(h) of the <em>Charter</em>. The CCLA also raises a
    new s. 7 argument. The CCLA seeks a broader declaration from this court banning
    the practice entirely for certain inmates (those aged 18-21, those with mental
    illness, and those placed in segregation for their own protection) and
    otherwise placing a cap of 15 consecutive days on administrative segregation
    for all inmates.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As I will explain, I accept the conclusions of
    the application judge with respect to inmates aged 18-21, those with mental
    illness, and those placed in segregation for their own protection. However,
    prolonged administrative segregation of any inmate, which is segregation for more
    than 15 consecutive days, does not survive constitutional scrutiny under s. 12.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I reach this conclusion because prolonged administrative
    segregation causes foreseeable and expected harm which may be permanent and
    which cannot be detected through monitoring until it has already occurred. Legislative
    safeguards are inadequate to avoid the risk of harm. In my view, this outrages
    standards of decency and amounts to cruel and unusual treatment. I conclude
    that the provisions in the Act authorizing prolonged administrative segregation
    infringe s. 12 and the infringement cannot be justified under s. 1. It follows
    that a remedy under s. 52(1) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982 </em>is
    appropriate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To demonstrate my conclusions, I describe administrative
    segregation, outline the evidence concerning the harm caused and the inability
    of monitoring or other legislative safeguards to prevent the risk of harm. I explain
    why ss. 31-37 of the Act infringe s. 12 of the <em>Charter, </em>and why the
    infringement cannot be justified under s. 1. I also briefly address the CCLA’s
    s. 11(h) and s. 7 arguments.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND</p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>The legislative scheme</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The </span><span class=MsoHyperlink><i><span

style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Corrections and Conditional
    Release Act</span></a></span></i></span><span lang=EN-US> permits the
    Correctional Service of Canada (“CSC”) to place an inmate in administrative
    segregation. The provisions at issue are ss. 31-37. An inmate who is held in administrative
    segregation is permitted out of his or her cell for a minimum of two hours per
    day plus time for a daily shower.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The structure of the Act is as follows.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Purpose and principles</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Act includes a general “purpose and
    principles” section. Section 3 states that the purpose of the federal
    correctional system is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and
    safe society by (a) carrying out sentences imposed by courts through the safe
    and humane custody and supervision of offenders; and (b) assisting the
    rehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into the community as
    law-abiding citizens through the provision of programs in penitentiaries and in
    the community. Section 3.1 states that “[t]he protection of society is the
    paramount consideration for the Service in the corrections process.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 4 sets out nine principles that guide
    the CSC in achieving the purpose set out in s. 3. These include that “the
    Service uses measures that are consistent with the protection of society, staff
    members and offenders and that are limited to only what is necessary and
    proportionate to attain the purposes of this Act” and that “offenders retain
    the rights of all members of society except those that are, as a consequence of
    the sentence, lawfully and necessarily removed or restricted”: ss. 4(c)-4(d).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The discretion to order administrative
    segregation rests with the institutional head, usually the prison warden or his
    or her delegate. Once that discretion is exercised, the inmate is placed in a
    segregated prison cell and remains there indefinitely until the institutional
    head decides to order release. The inmate is to be allowed out of his or her
    cell for a minimum of two hours daily, including one hour for exercise outdoors,
    and must also be given an opportunity to take a daily shower. At all other
    times the inmate remains locked in his or her cell, except if there is a
    lockdown when they do not leave their cells at all.</span></p>

    segregation is the elimination of meaningful social interaction or stimulus. The
    photographic evidence adduced by the CCLA in this case depicts a small cell where
    the inmate is held. It contains a narrow platform with a thin mattress overtop,
    a toilet, a sink, maybe or maybe not a small table, maybe or maybe not a small
    window. The heavy steel door has a small food slot a few feet off the ground.
    It is often through this food slot that interactions with staff and health

    Doc A/Res/70/175 (17 December 2015) (the “Mandela Rules”). The Mandela Rules

    meaningful human contact.” </span><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>They
    prohibit the use of prolonged solitary confinement, which is confinement for a

    Istanbul Statement on the Use and Effects of Solitary Confinement </em>adopted
    by a panel of experts at the International Psychological Trauma Symposium (9
    December 2007), which indicates that solitary confinement should only be used
    in very exceptional cases, for as short a time as possible, only as a last
    resort and should be absolutely prohibited for certain populations including
    mentally ill prisoners and children under the age of 18. In 2013, the
    Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stressed that prolonged or indefinite
    isolation through solitary confinement may never be a legitimate instrument in
    the hands of the state.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the court below, the AGC submitted that the
    CSC does not practice what the Mandela Rules referred to as solitary
    confinement. It pointed to the fact that federal inmates in Canada are allowed
    out of their cell for more than two hours per day because, in addition to the
    two hours, they are also allowed a daily shower. The application judge sensibly
    rejected this submission and concluded that the CSC is using administrative
    segregation in a way captured by the term “solitary confinement” as defined in
    the Mandela Rules. The application judge also found that the evidence of
    perfunctory contact between inmates in segregation and CSC staff did not
    constitute “meaningful” human contact. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In making those findings, the application judge
    relied on the expert evidence of Juan E. M<a name="_Hlk13831">é</a>ndez, a
    professor of human rights law at the Washington College of Law. Professor Méndez
    previously taught at Georgetown Law School and the Johns Hopkins School of
    Advanced International Studies and teaches regularly at the University of Oxford.
    He was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture </span><span

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Professor Méndez explained that the essence of
    solitary confinement is a lack of meaningful social contact with the result
    that social stimulus is insufficient to allow the individual to remain in a
    reasonable state of mental health. When individuals are deprived of social
    stimulation, they become incapable of maintaining an adequate state of
    alertness and attention to their environment. If this occurs for even a few
    days, brain activity shifts toward an abnormal pattern.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Professor Méndez also explained that the Mandela
    Rules represent an international consensus of proper principles and practices
    in the management of prisons and the treatment of those confined. The
    application judge accepted this evidence. At para. 59, he stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Professor [M</span>é<span
lang=EN>ndez’s] position concerning more than 15 days in segregation evolved
    from a contextual analysis to a hard and fast rule because the international
    community came to a consensus view about this in December 2015 when the United
    Nations approved the Mandela Rules revision. Professor [M</span>é<span lang=EN>ndez’s]
    view of the 15-day limit has been informed by the international consensus
    achieved in 2015. His current view in this regard is largely like limitations
    suggested domestically by the Arbour Commission and the </span><em>Ashley Smith
    Inquest</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While not binding on Canada, Canadian
    representatives had a role in drafting the Mandela Rules. The rules reflect a general
    shift in social views regarding acceptable treatment or punishment. Public
    perceptions of the appropriate way to treat inmates have evolved, thanks in
    large part to the efforts of inmates and their advocates. What was once
    considered acceptable – the death penalty for example – is no longer. Today, as
    society has become informed about the harm caused by solitary confinement, the public’s
    views have changed. In <em>R. v. Prystay</em>, 2019 ABQB 8, Pentelechuk J. (as
    she then was) said, at para. 128:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Societal views on what is
    acceptable treatment or punishment evolve over time. Forced sterilization,
    residential schools, lobotomies to treat mental disorders, corporal punishment
    in schools and the death penalty are all examples of treatment once considered
    acceptable. Segregation ravages the body and the mind. There is growing
    discomfort over its continued use as a quick solution to complex problems.</p>
  <h1>Proceedings below</h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>Application to the Superior Court</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-US>The CCLA applied to the Superior Court
    alleging that ss. 31-37 of the Act violate ss. 12, 11(h) and 7 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Charter</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>.</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the CCLA argued that administrative
    segregation of young adults aged 18-21 and inmates suffering from mental
    illness, as well as prolonged administrative segregation of any inmate beyond
    15 days, constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment contrary to s.
    12. The CCLA put forth evidence that administrative segregation would be detrimental
    for young persons because their brains are still maturing; those with mental
    illness are particularly vulnerable to harm from administrative segregation;
    and prolonged segregation poses a serious risk of negative psychological
    effects, such that a legislative scheme that permits it amounts to cruel and
    unusual treatment or punishment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the CCLA argued that the practice of segregating
    inmates for their own protection amounts to an additional form of punishment,
    contrary to the prohibition against double jeopardy enshrined in s. 11(h) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Charter</span></em><span lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the CCLA alleged that the Act infringes
    s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> in a manner that is grossly disproportionate,
    arbitrary and lacking in procedural fairness, contrary to the principles of
    fundamental justice. Though the record before this court is not entirely clear,
    it appears the CCLA made two distinct s. 7 arguments. First, the CCLA argued
    that the legislative scheme authorizing administrative segregation is not in
    accordance with the principles of fundamental justice because it is grossly
    disproportionate. Second, the CCLA argued that the legislative scheme for
    reviewing segregation decisions is arbitrary and procedurally unfair because the
    scheme does not provide for independent oversight of the institutional head.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>Decision of the application judge</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the outset, the application judge found that
    the CCLA, which has public interest standing, could not seek a remedy under s.
    24(1) of the <em>Charter </em>because its own constitutional rights were not at
    issue. Instead, he held that the CCLA could only seek relief under s. 52(1) of
    the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, and that such relief would only be
    available if the CCLA could show that the Act itself was unconstitutional. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On this basis, the application judge concluded
    that the administration of the statutory scheme was not the material issue. While
    flawless administration was not a reason to refuse a declaration of invalidity
    pursuant to s. 52(1), individual cases of maladministration did not prove that
    the statute was incapable of constitutional administration. Citing <em>Little
    Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice)</em>, 2000 SCC
    69, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1120, at para. 71, the application judge held that, as a
    matter of law, Parliament was entitled to assume that its enactments will be
    applied constitutionally by the public service.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge rejected the CCLA’s
    submissions with respect to s. 12 of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He was not satisfied that the evidence proved
    that because the brain of a person aged 18 to 21 continues to develop, that
    person is vulnerable to severe termination of development if exposed to administrative
    segregation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to inmates with mental illness, the
    application judge found that the existing legislative scheme and relevant
    Commissioner’s Directives provide adequate protection because there are limits
    on placing inmates with mental illness in administrative segregation. Specifically,
    s. 87(a) of the Act requires the institutional head and the independent
    reviewer to consider the inmate’s health, including the inmate’s mental health,
    when making the decision to place or maintain the inmate in administrative
    segregation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-US>With respect to prolonged administrative
    segregation, the application judge found that there were serious risks of
    negative psychological harm that could occur as early as 48 hours after segregation
    and were exacerbated by prolonged segregation. The application judge also noted
    that negative psychological effects may not be observable and that the current
    regime waits for negative psychological effects to manifest in a recognizable
    observable form before supporting or removing the inmate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite these findings, the application judge
    concluded that prolonged administrative segregation did not amount to cruel and
    unusual punishment or treatment in part because monitoring can identify when an
    inmate’s condition is deteriorating. At para. 269, the application judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>If effective
    monitoring is possible and I believe it is and if section 87(a) is applied as
    the </span><em>Corrections and Conditional Release Act</em><span lang=EN-US> requires, then I do not believe the current legislative scheme which permits
    prolonged administrative segregation must inevitably result in the treatment of
    an inmate which is grossly disproportionate to the safety risk the inmate
    presents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the CCLA’s s. 11(h) claim, the
    application judge rejected the argument that placing an inmate in
    administrative segregation changes the nature of the inmate’s incarceration and
    imposes a harsher sanction than that contemplated at sentencing. The CCLA’s s.
    11(h) claim was dismissed on this basis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the application judge dismissed the
    CCLA’s s. 7 gross disproportionality argument because, in his view, s. 7 “cannot
    find a treatment or punishment disproportionate where it passes the test under
    section 12”: at para. 267, relying on <em>R. v. Malmo-Levine; R. v. Caine</em>,
    2003 SCC 74, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at para. 160. However, the application judge concluded
    there was a breach of s. 7 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> because there was no independent review of the decision to segregate
    an inmate and the breach was not saved by s. 1. He declared ss. 31-37 of the
    Act of no force and effect to the extent of this breach, but suspended the
    declaration of invalidity for one year, until December 18, 2018, to provide
    Parliament time to enact an appropriate legislative response. As noted above, the
    AGC does not challenge the application judge’s s. 7 decision. </span></p>

    the safety of any person or the security of a penitentiary is in jeopardy or
    during the investigation of a possible criminal or serious disciplinary charge.
    It can only be used if there is no reasonable alternative. The inmate must be
    released from segregation at the earliest appropriate time. The legislation
    expressly prohibits the use of cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. Properly

    that merely excessive treatment or disproportionate treatment is not enough to

    the application judge was not satisfied on the evidence presented that because their
    brains were still developing, they were “vulnerable to severe termination of
    development if exposed to administrative segregation”: at para. 211. The CCLA
    has not challenged this finding on appeal but states that the application judge
    erred by requiring that the termination of development be “severe”. There was
    no evidence of termination of development before 15 days. In my view, this is

  <p class=Heading>Persons with mental illness</p>

    legislative scheme, as properly interpreted and applied, did not offend s. 12
    insofar as it permits subjecting inmates with mental illness to administrative
    segregation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In reaching that conclusion, he examined
    Commissioner’s Directive 709 and s. 87(a) of the Act<em>.</em> He found there
    was an inconsistency between the directive and s. 87(a). On the one hand, para.
    19 of CD-709 precludes administrative segregation for those who meet certain
    criteria, including those with “serious mental illness with significant
    impairment”. On the other hand, s. 87(a) states that the offender’s state of
    health “shall” be taken into account with respect to administrative segregation.
    The application judge found that CD-709 creates a risk that the institutional
    head will exercise his or her discretion in a way that contravenes s. 87(a),
    because the directive implies that a mentally ill inmate not falling within the
    class described in the directive can be placed in administrative segregation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He also found there was ambiguity in the
    legislation. Section 31(3) (which specifies the basis on which the
    institutional head may order that an inmate be placed in administrative
    segregation) and s. 32 (which specifies the factors the institutional head
    shall consider in the decision whether to release an inmate) do not reference
    mental health as a consideration for the admission to or release from administrative
    segregation. However, s. 87(a) stipulates that an inmate’s mental health must
    be taken into consideration in decisions relating to administrative
    segregation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge resolved the ambiguity and
    inconsistency through an exercise in statutory interpretation. I agree with the
    application judge’s interpretation of the statute. The institutional head has a
    discretion to place an inmate in administrative segregation, which seems clear
    from the use of the word “may” in s. 31(3), and must when exercising that
    discretion take into account s. 87(a) of the Act. Similarly, as found by the
    application judge, the independent reviewer, necessitated under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>,
    is also making a discretionary decision concerning whether to continue administrative
    segregation and must also consider s. 87(a). Neither is to inhibit the exercise
    of their individual discretion by assuming that inmates not captured in para. 19
    of CD-709 are eligible for placement in administrative segregation regardless
    of the state of their mental health. Neither can ignore an inmate’s mental
    health and decide to segregate solely based on the criteria in s. 31(3) of the
    Act. </span></p>

    resolution of the apparent conflict between CD-709 and the Act, I do not share his
    confidence about the efficacy of s. 87(a) in preventing serious harm to inmates
    with a mental illness. In principle, I agree with the CCLA that those with
    mental illness should not be placed in administrative segregation. However, the
    evidence does not provide the court with a meaningful way to identify those
    inmates whose particular mental illnesses are of such a kind as to render administrative
    segregation for any length of time cruel and unusual. I take some comfort in my
    view that a cap of 15 days would reduce the risk of harm to inmates who suffer
    from mental illness – at least until the court has the benefit of medical and
    institutional expert evidence to address meaningful guidelines. This issue
    therefore remains to be determined another day.</span></p>

    or treatment.</span></p>

    observable negative mental health effects consequent upon prolonged
    administrative segregation [were] grossly disproportionate” (para. 263), the
    application judge considered a hypothetical situation. He concluded that the
    current legislative scheme, which permits prolonged segregation, would not “inevitably
    result in the treatment of an inmate which is grossly disproportionate to the
    safety risk the inmate presents”: at para. 269. He reached this conclusion on
    the basis that effective monitoring is possible and that s. 87(a) requires an
    inmate’s health, including an inmate’s mental health, to be taken into
    consideration in deciding whether to place or maintain an inmate in
    segregation.</span></p>

    detects harm <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>once it
    has already occurred</span></span> – it does not predict or prevent it. As I
    will also explain, the application judge engaged in the wrong comparative
    exercise in assessing whether there was a s. 12 breach. Finally, I will explain
    why the safeguards in the legislation are inadequate, such that the legislation
    itself infringes s. 12. First, however, I will review the application judge’s factual

    little assistance in determining the issues raised on this appeal. I say this

    before it on the effects of administrative segregation on either the inmate
    himself or on other inmates. By contrast, the volume of direct and expert
    evidence adduced in the present appeal is considerable. Second, this appeal is
    being heard more than 30 years after <em>Olson </em>was decided, in a markedly
    different social and legal landscape as demonstrated by developments in scholarly
    research and international law: see <em>Carter v. Canada</em> <em>(Attorney

    maintain an inmate in administrative segregation. He was of the view that in
    applying s. 87(a), the institutional head engages in a balancing exercise,

lang=EN-US>Under s. 87(a), the institutional head need only “consider” the

    from, administrative segregation. The word “consider” is significant. It
    implies that the inmate’s health is merely one consideration among others. It
    is not the paramount consideration. By structuring the institutional head’s discretion
    in this way, s. 87(a) authorizes prioritizing other considerations over the
    inmate’s health, so long as the inmate’s health forms part of the
    decision-making process. Thus, even when properly applied, s. 87(a) does not protect
    against the risk of an inmate suffering cruel and unusual treatment.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>On appeal, the AGC points to additional legislative safeguards besides
    s. 87(a) that it says are sufficient to render the Act constitutional. For
    instance, s. 31(2) requires the institutional head to release an inmate from
    segregation at the “earliest appropriate time”. Section 31(3) states that
    administrative segregation can only be used if there is “no reasonable
    alternative”. Section 69 of the Act expressly prohibits the use of “cruel,
    inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment”. These provisions, the AGC
    submits, guard against the risk of grossly disproportionate treatment if
    properly applied by the institutional head. The Act is therefore capable of
    constitutional compliance. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>Is there then a principle of
