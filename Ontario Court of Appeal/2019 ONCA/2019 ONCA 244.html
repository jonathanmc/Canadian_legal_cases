    opposite ends of the “Twitterverse.” The motion judge described the respondent
    as “the principle of an online media outlet, Rebel News, which is known as an
    online media site that comments on political and social issues, espousing
    right-wing or right-leaning views”: </span><em>Levant v. Day</em><span

    regular participant on social media for over a decade” who maintained a blog
    named “Canadian Cynic”: </span><em>Levant</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 7. He
    expressed his views almost exclusively on Twitter. The appellant describes his
    views as liberal, progressive and left-wing.</span></p>

    posted tweets highly critical of the respondent and of Rebel News relating to
    their campaign to raise money for the victims of the Fort McMurray forest fires. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In those tweets the appellant alleged matters
    such as the following:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was engaged in a scam of
    “unadulterated sleaziness” so that he could improperly take advantage of other
    donors’ charitable tax receipts. By leading the fundraising campaign, the respondent
    was enriching himself at the expense of forest fire victims.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent would use charitable donations
    intended for those victims to pay his personal legal expenses.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent falsely promised that donors to
    his campaign would get tax receipts.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fort McMurray residents would lose promised
    matching donations from the federal and provincial governments, which would
    have been available had donations been made directly to the Red Cross.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The payment of a 5% administration fee meant
    less money went to victims.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even though the Red Cross confirmed on May 13
    that they would provide a charitable tax receipt to donors using the Rebel News
    website, the appellant continued to assert that the respondent had treated the
    donors badly, and said he could not have invented a scheme as “sleazy or
    grandstanding or narcissistic as what Ezra came up with”.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 1, 2016 the appellant tweeted that he
    was advised by authoritative sources that the donations made as a result of the
    respondent’s campaign would not qualify for matching donations, and the donors
    would not get tax receipts.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 3 and 4, 2016, the appellant suggested
    that the respondent had a reputation as a “liar, con artist and scumbag”, with
    little reputation to damage, and that he had siphoned his money away from the
    Red Cross.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-US>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, on June 4, the appellant suggested that
    the respondent was “fucking donors out of their tax receipts”, implied that he was
    a “sleazy opportunist, hack, con artist and grafter” and that he was raising
    money for himself. </span></p>

    of Justice Act</em><span lang=EN-US> provide as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Dismissal of proceeding that limits debate</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Purposes</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>137.1 (1) The purposes of this section and sections 137.2 to
    137.5 are,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) to encourage individuals to express themselves on matters
    of public interest;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) to promote broad participation in debates on matters of
    public interest;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) to discourage the use of litigation as a means of unduly
    limiting expression on matters of public interest; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(d) to reduce the risk that participation by the public in
    debates on matters of public interest will be hampered by fear of legal action. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>Definition, “expression”</b></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) In this section,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>“expression” means any communication, regardless of whether it
    is made verbally or non-verbally, whether it is made publicly or privately, and
    whether or not it is directed at a person or entity.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Order to dismiss</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) On motion by a person against whom a proceeding is brought,
    a judge shall, subject to subsection (4), dismiss the proceeding against the
    person if the person satisfies the judge that the proceeding arises from an
    expression made by the person that relates to a matter of public interest. </p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>No dismissal</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) A judge shall not dismiss a proceeding under subsection (3)
    if the responding party satisfies the judge that,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) there are grounds to believe that,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>          (i) the proceeding has substantial merit, and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(ii) the moving party has no valid
    defence in the proceeding; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) the harm likely to be or have been suffered by the
    responding party as a result of the moving party’s expression is sufficiently
    serious that the public interest in permitting the proceeding to continue
    outweighs the public interest in protecting that expression. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ANALYSIS </h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the appellant’s tweets relate to a matter of public interest?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge held that the appellant had failed to satisfy his onus
    of showing that the expressions related to a matter of public interest: <em>Levant,</em> at paras. 24-25. She recognized that the Fort McMurray fires were matters of
    public interest, but found that the Day tweets were, “in pith and substance,
    direct personal attacks on Ezra Levant”: <em>Levant</em>, at para. 24. Citing <em>Able
    Translations Ltd. v. Express International Translations Inc.</em>, 2016 ONSC
    6785, 410 D.L.R. (4th) 380, aff’d 2018 ONCA 690, 428 D.L.R. (4th) 568, the
    motion judge noted that “[w]here the pith and substance of the matter is a
    defamatory personal attack thinly veiled as a discussion on matters of public
    interest, the court has all the tools it requires to determine the true nature
    of the expression and rule accordingly”:<em> Levant</em>, at para.&nbsp; 23.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did not have the benefit of this court’s decision in <em>1704604 Ontario
    Ltd. v.</em> <em>Pointes Protection Association</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>, 2018 ONCA 685, 142 O.R. (3d) 161, </span></em>in which the concept of
    “public interest” was summarized at para. 65: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In summary, the concept of “public
    interest” as it is used in s. 137.1(3) is a broad one <u>that does not take
    into account the merits or manner of the expression, nor the motive of the
    author</u>. The determination of whether an expression relates to a matter of
    public interest must be made objectively, having regard to the context in which
    the expression was made and the entirety of the relevant communication. An expression
    may relate to more than one matter. If one of those matters is a “matter of
    public interest”, the defendant will have met its onus under s. 137.1(3).
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    focusing on the merits of the allegation of defamation, the manner of expression
    and the motives of the author, the motion judge committed an extricable error
    of law displacing the deference otherwise due to her conclusion. While the
    motion judge found that the appellant had launched a defamatory personal
    attack, his motive for the tweets is a matter distinct from the subject matter
    of the tweets. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s tweets, when taken as a whole and in context, are about the
    legitimacy of the respondent’s fundraising campaign, the benefits which should
    properly flow to victims of the Fort McMurray forest fires from charitable
    contributions and the treatment of donor contributions. These indisputably
    relate to a matter of public interest.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were there grounds to believe that the appellant had no valid defence in
    the proceedings?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent satisfied the motion judge that there were grounds to believe that
    the appellant had no valid defences. The appellant had advanced the defences of
    fair comment and failure to provide notice pursuant to s. 5(1) of the <em>Libel
    and Slander Act </em>(the “Act”). The motion judge characterized the impugned Twitter
    posts as statements of fact, not comment based on facts:<em> Levant</em>, at
    para. 38. She observed that the statements were repeated, even after the
    appellant knew the statements were untrue: <em>Levant</em>, at para. 40. She
    concluded that the statements were motivated by malice and that there were
    reasonable grounds to believe that no defence of fair comment was made out: <em>Levant,</em> at paras. 41-42. With respect to the notice defence, the motion judge was of
    the view that s. 5(1) of the Act did not apply to Twitter posts: <em>Levant,</em> at paras. 45-47. In particular, the motion judge found that s. 5(1) of the Act
    refers to libel in a newspaper and broadcast, and noted that the appellant
    failed to provide any evidence regarding the functioning of Twitter or provide
    policy reasons to justify extending the meaning of “broadcast” to include
    content disseminated via Twitter: <em>Levant</em>, at paras. 45-47. The motion
    judge also declined to take judicial notice of such facts: <em>Levant</em>, at
    para.&nbsp;46.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Pointes</em> instructs that “[s]ection 137.1 does not provide an alternate means by which
    the merits of a claim can be tried, and it is not a form of summary judgment
    intended to allow defendants to obtain a quick and favourable resolution of the
    merits of allegations involving expressions on matters of public interest”: at
    para. 73. Rather, the motion judge must decide whether a conclusion that the
    defendant has no valid defence falls within “the range of conclusions
    reasonably available on the motion record”: <em>Pointes</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 75. Here, a trier could
    reasonably conclude that some of the defamatory statements made amounted to
    factual assertions, were not recognisable as comment and could reasonably
    conclude that the statements were made with malice. A trier might also
    reasonably conclude that s. 5(1) of the Act does not apply to the Twitter
    posts. Thus, the respondent has demonstrated that a conclusion that the
    appellant has no defence to the action is amongst the range of reasonable
    conclusions which might be reached by a trier and as such has met the test in
    s. 137.1 (4)(a)(ii), as explained in <em>Pointes</em>. Since the respondent has
    surmounted this hurdle, an analysis of the balancing test in s. 137.1(4)(b) is
    required. </p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the harm suffered or likely to be suffered serious enough to outweigh
    the public interest in protecting the expression embodied in the tweets?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge indicated that she was satisfied “that the interest in permitting
    the within proceeding to continue to trial outweighs the public interest in
    protecting the impugned expression contained in the Day [tweets]. In the
    circumstances of this case, there is no public interest in protecting said
    [tweets]”: <em>Levant</em>, at para. 54.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
    claims of defamation may exact too great a cost to the public interest in
    promoting and protecting freedom of expression in relation to matters of public
    interest: <em>Pointes</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at
    para. 86.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    pointed out in the Anti-SLAPP Advisory Panel<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a>, <em>Report to the Attorney General </em>(Ontario: Ministry of the Attorney General,
    2010), at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If an action against expression on
    a matter of public interest is based on a technically valid cause of action but
    seeks a remedy for only insignificant harm to reputation, business or personal
    interests, the action’s negative impact on freedom of expression may be clearly
    disproportionate to any valid purpose the litigation might serve.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the alleged defamatory statements accused the respondent of defrauding victims
    of the Fort McMurray forest fires. While the harm suffered or likely to be
    suffered may often be measured primarily by the monetary damages suffered or
    likely to be suffered, the “preservation of one’s good reputation” has inherent
    value beyond the monetary value of the claim: <em>Pointes,</em> at para. 88.
    Here, we are told the appellant had around 11,000 followers on Twitter. There
    is no indication the statements were made to a private, or closed group. These
    were not statements made to a small group and quickly retracted. The statements
    attribute serious criminality to the respondent. On his discovery, the
    appellant accepted that donors were receiving tax receipts for their donations.
    He admitted that he had not made any inquiries of the government about matching
    donations. He also admitted that he had no information that the respondent received
    any personal benefit from the fundraising campaign. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the respondent is a “noisy troublemaker” who does not
    shy away from controversy, and has participated in other defamation cases, as
    both plaintiff and defendant. The appellant submits that the respondent’s platform,
    Rebel Media, has relentlessly attacked and denigrated individuals and groups. The
    appellant further submits that the respondent’s reputation is so bad that the
    impugned tweets cannot have caused him any damages, especially since others
    made similar comments. Even if the appellant’s characterization of the respondent’s
    reputation were correct, and I make no finding on that issue, this is different
    from a reputation tainted with criminal conduct depriving innocent victims of
    charitable donations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    there is an ephemeral quality to individual tweets, which may have some bearing
    on the damages ultimately awarded, here the appellant engaged in a sustained attack
    upon the respondent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    cannot say that any damages awarded would necessarily be nominal, or that the respondent
    has suffered only insignificant harm. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other side of the balance, the quality of the expression and the motivation
    of the appellant are relevant to the measure of the public interest in
    protecting his expression: <em>Pointes,</em> at para. 94. This court in <em>Pointes</em>,
    at para. 94, held that “deliberate falsehoods, gratuitous personal attacks or vulgar
    and offensive language”, all part of the expression here, may reduce the public
    interest in protecting that speech, compared to cases where the message is
    delivered “without the lies, vitriol, and obscenities.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not to say that resort to some vulgar language will necessarily deprive
    expression of value worth protecting. However here the tweets posted are imbued
    with hyperbole and vulgar vitriol, and admittedly false in many respects such that
    there is little value in protecting their expression. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    balance, the respondent has established that the harm likely to be suffered, or
    which has been suffered, is sufficiently serious that the public interest in
    allowing the proceeding to continue outweighs the public interest in protecting
    the appellant’s expression. </p>

    order because of the procedural unfairness of counsel making further
    unsolicited submissions to the motion judge without the consent of the
    appellant, and without invitation from the court. While leave to appeal costs
    is rarely granted, in this case, this court should look at costs afresh because
    of the uncertainty as to the effect if any, those additional submissions had on
    the motion judge. Rule 1.09 of the </span><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><span
lang=EN-US>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 provides:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>When a proceeding is pending before the court, no party to the proceeding

    each of their positions before the motion judge, and her assessment of the
    merits as having an impact upon the issue of costs of the motion. The most
    significant factor here, however, is that the anti-SLAPP motion was brought
    after the action was set down for trial. As indicated in </span><em>Pointes</em><span
lang=EN-US> at para. 73, s. 137.1 establishes a “judicial screening or triage
    device designed to eliminate certain claims at an early stage of the litigation
    process.” Section 137.1 contains various provisions intended to expedite the
    hearing of these motions, including a prohibition against taking other steps
    until the motion is heard: </span><em>Pointes</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para.
    43. Given the serious cost consequences which can result from a successful
    anti-SLAPP motion, such as full indemnity costs as per s. 137.1(7), these
    motions should be brought early in the proceedings. Here, the delay in bringing
    the anti-SLAPP motion justified an award of costs in favour of the successful
    plaintiff, the respondent, despite s. 137.1(8).</span></p>

    level.” The respondent submits that appellant’s counsel were made aware of the
    date change by email dated June 19, 2017, the date he says the hearing of the
    motion was scheduled to continue. The parties do not agree as to whether the
    motion was to be continued on June 19 or June 20, 2017. The record is not of
    much help establishing precisely what happened, nor exactly how the additional
    costs claimed were incurred. The motion judge did not address this issue.</span></p>
