lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defendants appeal from the decision of the motion
    judge refusing to dismiss this defamation action pursuant to s. 137.1 of the <em>Courts
    of Justice Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43,
    the “Anti-SLAPP provisions”</span></em>. For the reasons that follow, I would
    dismiss the appeal. </span></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Factual overview: the publication </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant Beacon Publishing Inc. published
    an article written by the appellant Edward. R. Myers in a magazine entitled
    “FrontLine Security”. The appellant Christina MacLean is the owner, general
    manager and editor of the magazine. The other appellants appeared on the
    masthead of the publication as members of the editorial board, but appear to
    have had no knowledge of or involvement in the publication. The respondent, Grand
    River Enterprises Six Nations Ltd. (“GRE”) is a large manufacturer of
    cigarettes, and Jerry Montour is its CEO.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The publication is in a glossy magazine style
    format, and has the appearance of a professionally produced publication. There
    is a banner across the top of the front cover reading “Public Safety, Security,
    Enforcement, Emergency Management.” Below that is the title “FrontLine Safety
    &amp; Security”, followed by a large print heading meant to indicate the
    contents of the publication, “Illicit Tobacco Why is it a Big Deal?” followed
    by “The World Stage”, “Canada’s Tobacco Roads” and “Courses of Action”: <em>FrontLine
    Security </em>11: Special Edition (2016). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The overall thrust of the publication is that
    contraband tobacco is associated with organized crime, smuggling and terrorism.
    This is made clear in the opening page of the magazine, at p. 3: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Last year in Canada, “organized crime”
    syphoned off nearly $3 billion from the Canadian tax base, according to
    experts. Without this fraud, taxpayers would be able to use that money for
    their own benefit rather than bolstering the crime kingpins who support
    ancillary activities such as weapons trafficking and human sex slavery. Some of
    the proceeds of illicit tobacco have been tracked to international terrorists
    and mass murderers like Mokhtar Belmokhtar (aka “</span><em>Mr. Marlboro</em><span
lang=EN-US>”). January 2016 saw him take the lives of six humanitarian workers
    from Quebec during the Burkina Faso massacre of more than 20 innocent tourists.
    In 2008, he famously kidnapped and held Canadian diplomat, Robert Fowler, for 130
    days.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>From a simple economic perspective, the threat
    of contraband tobacco may be counted in terms of a lost tax stream. However,
    even more dire economic consequences are at risk in our trading relationships
    around the world. Heads of State in several Latin American countries have seen
    their local economies jeopardized by illicit tobacco from Canada. These foreign
    jurisdictions deal with the drug cartels of infamy. Their partnership with
    Canadian smugglers allows the cartels to fuel their operations through cheap,
    tax-free cigarette revenue from Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The law enforcement community acknowledges
    that more – not less – needs to be done to monitor the movement of all tobacco
    in Canada. The sources of raw tobacco used for contraband cigarette production
    are largely from either Southwest Ontario or the Eastern U.S. (North Carolina
    and Virginia).</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>While partisan
    politics saw the death of this initiative, the proposed study is important.
    Recent law enforcement activities have unearthed a dangerous network of
    organized criminal groups that handle different parts of an international
    smuggling ring that starts in the tobacco growing fields in Canada and the
    U.S., then moves to the manufacturing operations on aboriginal reserves, and
    finally makes its way into the international smuggling networks.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This theme is reinforced by multiple, prominent
    references connecting terrorism and tobacco smuggling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Part 2 of the publication focuses on Canada, and
    links criminal activity to contraband tobacco, at p. 9:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In the past five
    years, some progress has been made but much of the </span><em>status quo</em><span
lang=EN-US> continues. Moreover, some disturbing new trends are emerging that
    suggest our internal challenges have leaked across our borders and are causing
    problems to governments and communities abroad. To make matters worse, last
    year some provinces increased the tax on tobacco products and the federal
    government recently announced plans to introduce plain packaging. While these
    and other measures go far in regulating lawful products, they are, in fact, </span><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>welcomed by the criminal element</span></strong><span
lang=EN-US> as an opportunity to gain further competitive advantages in the
    marketplace. In this section, as we look at how the illicit trade of tobacco is
    currently positioned within our borders, our focus is almost exclusively on
    illicit cigarettes manufactured in Ontario and Quebec and the factors driving
    this criminal and lucrative trade.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Specific references to the respondent corporation
    follow. Immediately beside the above passage, linking crime to cigarettes
    manufactured in Ontario, is a photograph of “Putter’s” cigarettes, a brand
    manufactured by the respondent corporation with the caption “Do you smoke
    contraband cigarettes?” and showing the results of an online poll conducted by
    a newspaper.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The publication goes on to connect the
    respondent corporation to smuggled goods in Costa Rica and in Mexico, at pp. 18-19:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><i>Costa Rica</i></strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>A team of journalists from Costa Rican
    newspaper, </span><em>Diario Extra</em><span lang=EN-US>, travelled to Canada
    to investigate the growing trend of cigarettes being smuggled into their
    country. Specifically, the team visited Grand River Enterprises, a tobacco
    manufacturer on Six Nations in Ohsweken, Ontario. The report by </span><em>Diario
    Extra</em><span lang=EN-US> suggested that Grand River Enterprises is known by
    Costa Rican authorities in connection with smuggled products and organized
    crime. An official quoted by the newspaper says there have been an increasing
    number of investigations involving the Seneca brand of cigarettes, which is
    manufactured by Grand River Enterprises, and that it “was becoming one of the
    biggest smuggled goods in our country.”</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><i>Mexico</i></strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Another media outlet in Mexico, </span><em>El
    Financiero</em><span lang=EN-US>, picked up on the same theme and published a
    7-minute exposé for television on the problem of contraband tobacco in Mexico.
    The report indicates that 17% of cigarettes sold in Mexico are contraband, and
    contends that the main supplier is Grand River Enterprises, a manufacturing
    plant in Six Nations.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The </span><em>El
    Financiero</em><span lang=EN-US> report estimates that 1.87 million of Mexico’s
    population is supplied by contraband cigarettes. This is a dedicated market and
    a lucrative base that is being exploited by criminal enterprise for illicit
    gain. For many in Canada’s political system, it is important that they become
    informed and understand the direct links of this criminal activity to Canada’s
    legislation, regulation and other government polices.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, at p. 23, the publication went on to
    connect both respondents to black market cannabis cultivation:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Fanning the Flames</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><i>Diversifying the Black
    Market</i></strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote>… </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In July last year, <em>Vice News</em> reported that federal law enforcement officers in the United States seized more
    than 12,000 cannabis plants from two farming operations on tribal land in
    California. The connection to Canada is that the operation was allegedly
    financed by Jerry Montour, CEO Grand River Enterprises, a cigarette
    manufacturer based in Six Nations, Ontario. The article suggests that Montour’s
    alleged connection is one of the first seemingly concrete examples of the
    tobacco industry diversifying its portfolio. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>FrontLine Security normally publishes four times
    a year, and has a circulation of about 16,000. This was a special edition of
    the magazine that was produced in addition to its normal publication schedule. It
    is published both in hard copy and online. According to the appellants, it is
    distributed to members of Parliament and Cabinet, provincial legislatures, and
    industry executives in the fields of national and border security, policing,
    infrastructure security, IT security, emergency preparedness and tax and trade
    policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents plead that the magazine included
    multiple defamatory meanings, including that GRE “smuggles illegal tobacco
    products”, “is helping finance terrorists through the sale of contraband
    tobacco products”, “is a criminal organization”, “smuggles its brands into
    Costa Rica”, “supplies contraband cigarettes to nearly 1.87 million individuals
    in Mexico”, “does business with Latin American drug cartels” and “foments
    corruption”. </span></p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Decision of the motion judge</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion by the appellants, to summarily
    dismiss the action pursuant to s. 137.1 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act </em>was
    dismissed. In coming to this decision, the motion judge concluded that the vast
    majority of the issues dealt with in the publication are matters of public
    interest, particularly the issues surrounding contraband tobacco: <em>Montour
    et al v. Beacon Publishing Inc. et al,</em> 2017 ONSC 4735, at paras. 16-22. He
    also found that there was no doubt that the words complained of were published
    and named the respondents. He indicated that “[t]he words state that the plaintiffs
    smuggle contraband tobacco and that they are involved with organized crime. Such
    words are clearly defamatory. I therefore conclude that the claim has
    substantial merit”: <em>Montour</em>, at para. 24. Those findings are not in
    issue on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge dealt with four defences raised
    by the appellants: (1) justification, (2) responsible communication, (3) qualified
    privilege and (4) fair comment. He concluded that none of the defences were
    made out on the evidence before him. I will now turn to those defences
    individually and briefly summarize the motion judge’s holding on each. </span></p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justification</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge rejected justification because
    the appellants pleaded only a broad generalization that “these statements were
    true in substance and in fact as of the date of publication” and because the appellants
    relied on other publications which had expressed what they say were similar
    views: <em>Montour</em>, at paras. 27-28. The motion judge cited the “repetition
    rule” from <em>Grant v. Torstar Corp.</em>, 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640,
    at para. 119, which holds “that repeating a libel has the same legal
    consequences as originating it. This rule reflects the law’s concern that one
    should not be able to freely publish a scurrilous libel simply by purporting to
    attribute the allegation to someone else.”</span></p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Responsible communication</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge rejected the responsible
    communication defence at paras. 31- 32 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[31] Alleging that
    someone is a smuggler of tobacco and associated with organized crime is clearly
    a serious allegation of criminal activity. On the record before me the due
    diligence to verify these allegations was non-existent other than relying on
    the comments of others. Contraband tobacco as an issue is of public importance
    but there was no urgency in producing the article that would justify failing to
    verify the facts as reported. The sources for the comments about the Plaintiffs
    were other articles that had been published. Those articles were not fact
    checked in any manner that has been shown in the record before me.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[32] <i>Grant</i> states at para. 116 “in most cases, it is inherently unfair to publish
    defamatory allegations of fact without giving the target an opportunity to
    respond.” I conclude, based on the record before me, that the Plaintiffs side
    of the story was not sought. I also conclude that it was not reported in the
    Defendants article, when referring to another publication <i>El </i><i>Dario, </i>that
    it had been reported in that article that the Plaintiffs had denied any
    involvement in contraband tobacco. Likewise the article of the Defendants did
    not report the fact that the cultivation of marijuana was legal on tribal lands
    in California as reported in the <i>Vice</i> <i>News</i> which was used as a

  <p class=CQuote>[88] The harm suffered or likely to

    will be measured primarily by the monetary damages suffered or likely to be
    suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the impugned expression. <u>However,
    harm to the plaintiff can refer to non-monetary harm as well. The preservation
    of one’s good reputation or one’s personal privacy have inherent value beyond
    the monetary value of a claim. Both are tied to an individual’s liberty and
    security interests and can, in the appropriate circumstances, be taken into
    account in assessing the harm caused to the plaintiff by the defendant’s
    expression:</u> <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto</i>, [1995] 2
    S.C.R. 1130, at paras. 117-21; <i>Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights

  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[90] On the s. 137.1 motion, the plaintiff must provide a basis
    upon which the motion judge can make some assessment of the harm done or likely
    to be done to it by the impugned expression. This will almost inevitably
    include material providing some quantification of the monetary damages. The
    plaintiff is not, however, expected to present a fully-developed damages brief.
    Assuming the plaintiff has cleared the merits hurdle in s. 137.1(4)(a), a
    common sense reading of the claim, supported by sufficient evidence to draw a
    causal connection between the challenged expression and damages that are more
    than nominal will often suffice. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[91] The plaintiff cannot,
    however, rely on bald assertions in the statement of claim relating to damages,
    or on unsourced, unexplained damage claims contained in the pleadings or
    affidavits filed on the s. 137.1 motion. The motion judge must be able to make
    an informed assessment, at least at a general or “ballpark” level, about the
    nature and quantum of the damages suffered or likely to be suffered by the
    plaintiff: see <i>Able Translations Ltd. v. Express International Translations

    evidence linking any financial loss to the defamatory remarks. It is often

    cases of slander) there is a presumption of damage: which presumption has in my
    view, as will be gathered, not of itself been displaced by the 2013 Act. But
    there is no presumption, at law, of </span><em>serious</em><span lang=EN-US> damage in a libel case. Accordingly that, under s. 1(1), has to be proved. The

    allow the action to proceed. If an action against expression on a matter of
    public interest is based on a technically valid cause of action but seeks a

    did not mention was that American federal authorities permitted cultivation and
    sale of medical marijuana on tribal lands, as was reported by <em>Vice News</em>.
    The implication of the reference in the publication was that the respondents were
    involved in criminal activity. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The test for evaluating whether there is a valid
    defence within the meaning of s. 137.1 was outlined in paras. 83 - 84 of <em>Pointes
    Protection</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[83] I would add two further observations with respect to the
    “no valid defence” requirement in s. 137.1(4)(a)(ii). That provision requires
    the plaintiff to satisfy the motion judge that there are reasonable grounds to
    believe that the defendant has “no valid defence” to the plaintiff’s claim. The
    section would be unworkable if the plaintiff were required to address all
    potential defences and demonstrate that none had any validity. I think the
    section contemplates an evidentiary burden on the defendant to advance any
    proposed “valid defence” in the pleadings, and/or in the material filed on the
    s. 137.1 motion. That material should be sufficiently detailed to allow the
    motion judge to clearly identify the legal and factual components of the
    defences advanced. Once the defendant has put a defence in play, the persuasive
    burden moves to the plaintiff to satisfy the motion judge that there are
    reasonable grounds to believe that none of the defences put in play are valid.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[84] My second observation relates
    to the word “valid”. I would interpret “valid” as meaning successful. The onus
    rests on the plaintiff to convince the motion judge that, looking at the motion
    record through the reasonableness lens, a trier could conclude that none of the
    defences advanced would succeed. If that assessment is among those reasonably
    available on the record, the plaintiff has met its onus.</p>

lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, the appellants’ statements linking the respondents
    to criminal activity are based on statements attributed to others, which are of
    unknown value, which do not obviously support the conclusions expressed by the appellants.
    For example, the translation of the Mexican newspaper article relied upon by
    the appellants, to connect the respondents to contraband tobacco, is of unknown
    quality, and the article could be read as suggesting that the respondent
    corporation was not associated with contraband at the time. The appellants also
    suggest that a study by a major accounting firm supports the allegation that the
    respondent corporation smuggled tobacco and was involved with organized crime. This
    study does not on its face support the allegation that the respondent
    corporation was smuggling contraband tobacco or was involved in organized
    crime. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, this study was commissioned by another
    tobacco company, a competitor to the respondent corporation. The study cautions
    that the accounting firm has not sought to establish the reliability of the
    information sources by references to other evidence, and that the report was
    only designed to benefit the company who commissioned the study.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As was discussed earlier, the appellants’

    justification. </span></p>
