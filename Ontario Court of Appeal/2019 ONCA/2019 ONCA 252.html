    aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault (x2), assault with a weapon,
    threatening death, assault causing bodily harm, and assault. He was given a
    global sentence of nine years, and was registered as a sex offender. The

lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant testified at trial that he did not
    commit the offences as charged. His evidence, if believed, would have rendered
    him not guilty on all counts. However, the trial judge found that the appellant
    was not a forthright witness; his evidence had many internal inconsistencies; it
    was not consistent with the evidence of most of the other witnesses, nor with
    the objective evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>With respect to the attempted aggravated assault
    and sexual assault charges, the appellant knew he was HIV positive around June
    2003. The trial judge reviewed the elements of the <em>mens rea</em> and <em>actus
    reus</em><i> </i>set out in <em>R. v. Williams</em>, 2003 SCC 41, [2003] 2
    S.C.R. 134. He rejected the appellant’s testimony that he disclosed his HIV
    positive status to the complainant in June 2003 and did not have sex with her
    thereafter. The trial judge found instead that the Crown had proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the complainant first learned that the appellant was HIV
    positive almost two years later in late March 2005. She would not have
    consented to sex had she known he was HIV positive. There was evidence they had
    unprotected sex after the appellant learned he was HIV positive although he
    denied it.</span></p>

    assault endangering life relating to the March 3, 2005 incident, the trial
    judge accepted the complainant’s evidence that the appellant knocked her to the
    ground and assaulted her, and then put a drill to her head and threatened to kill
    her. He relied on physical evidence such as the drill, the damage done to the
    wicker chair into which the appellant tossed the drill, and the complainant’s
    physical injuries. However, with respect to the aggravated assault charge,
    there was insufficient evidence that the sex was unprotected. The trial judge
    found the appellant guilty of the lesser and included offence of sexual
    assault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>With respect to the assault and sexual assault
    endangering life relating to the March 13, 2005 incident, the trial judge
    accepted the complainant’s evidence that the accused attended at her apartment,
    assaulted her, choked her, and then raped her. This was corroborated by
    material evidence, in particular, a pair of panties laden with his semen that was
    recovered from her laundry hamper a few days later. The trial judge found none
    of the appellant’s alternative explanations for the presence of his semen to be
    plausible. However, the trial judge found there was no evidence that this act
    of unprotected sex had endangered the complainant’s life, because she might
    already have been infected. He found the appellant guilty of the lesser and
    included offence of sexual assault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant submits that the trial judge’s
    credibility findings, which preferred the complainant’s evidence, were
    unreasonable. He argues that the significant inconsistencies in her evidence,
    some of which defied common sense, rendered her evidence incredible and
    unreliable. In oral argument, the appellant argued that he and the complainant
    had friendly relations after the alleged March 2005 assaults, showing that she
    was not credible.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I would reject the appellant’s arguments. The
    trial judge carefully detailed his findings and his reasons for them. The trial
    judge said: “[b]ecause of all of these factors that I have outlined that
    negatively impact on both the reliability and credibility of [the complainant],
    it is necessary to look at whether there is any objective evidence that
    confirms her evidence.” Knowing of the infirmities in the complainant’s evidence,
    the trial judge only accepted her evidence if it was corroborated by other
    objective evidence.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Crown proposed eight to ten years in Federal
    penitentiary less pre-trial custody at a credit rate of one to one. The defence
    proposed a sentence of four to six years less pre-trial custody with a two to
    one credit for pre-trial custody and a three to one credit for time spent in
    segregation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge sentenced the accused to a
    global sentence of nine years and gave him credit for five years and fifteen
    days of time served, which was calculated at the rate of 1.5 to one credit on
    three years and 133 days of actual incarceration. This left the accused with
    about four years left to serve on this sentence. The trial judge stayed the March
    13, 2005 sexual assault count on the <em>Kienapple</em> principle. The Crown
    pointed out that this sentence is being served concurrently with the
    appellant’s separate sentence on a murder conviction, which will be completed
    in 2031, thus rendering this sentence appeal somewhat moot. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge identified several mitigating
    factors in his sentencing reasons: the appellant had no previous criminal
    record; he was gainfully employed in his home country before immigrating to
    Canada; and he had served three years and 133 days of pre-trial custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge identified several aggravating
    factors: the appellant, after learning he was HIV positive, did not advise the
    complainant; given the nature of their relationship, his actions were a breach
    of trust. The trial judge also noted the appellant’s use of gratuitous violence
    and a weapon. He raped the complainant without a condom and terrorized her,
    with traumatizing effects. However, since it was possible that the complainant had
    contracted HIV before the appellant knew he was HIV positive, the fact that she
    was later found to be HIV positive was not taken to be an aggravating factor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge also observed that while the
    appellant was out on bail, he breached bail and was re-arrested. He was
    sentenced to a short period of jail on that breach, and then he was released on
    bail again. He was later charged with first degree murder. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge identified the range of
    sentences in cases involving non-disclosure of HIV positive status as from 1 to

    of sentencing. The trial judge identified denunciation and deterrence as the
    primary objectives in such cases. He found that a lengthy penitentiary sentence
    was necessary to reflect the accused’s conduct because he had attacked a
    vulnerable victim twice in a brutal fashion for his own sexual gratification.
    This led him to impose a sentence of 9 years’ imprisonment on the appellant.</span></p>

    focused on the core principle of trial fairness: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>While recognizing that <i>Amicus</i> is not
    counsel to the accused, the role of <i>Amicus</i>, I find, can be expanded to
    ensure trial fairness. See <em>R. v. Cairenius</em> (2008), 232 C.C.C, (3d) at
    page 13, Ontario Superior Court, and <em>R. v. Lee</em>, (1988), 125 C.C.C,
    (3d), 363, Northwest Territories. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>In this case, because of the nature of the
    sexual offences, with the consent of Mr. Imona-Russel and the Crown, I have
    already expanded the role of <i>Amicus</i> to allow <i>Amicus</i> to
    cross-examine the complainant. Obviously, to prepare the cross-examination, <i>Amicus</i>,
    Mr. Javed, must have discussions with the accused. Such discussions must remain
    confidential and will be treated by the Court as such. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Crown counsel, quite fairly, has also
    undertaken not to challenge the confidentiality of any such discussions in
    preparation for the cross-examination. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>In order to ensure trial fairness, I am
    prepared to allow <i>Amicus</i> to cross-examine Crown witnesses, provided Mr.
    Imona-Russel indicates he wishes such assistance with any or all of the
    witnesses. We will address each witness separately to determine whether Mr.
    Imona-Russel wishes the assistance of the <i>Amicus</i>, Mr. Javed, in
    cross-examining any of the witnesses. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>So it is clear, Mr. Javed, in his role of <i>Amicus</i>,
    will not be counsel for Mr. Imona-Russel. Should Mr. Imona-Russel wish
    assistance with the cross-examination, and Mr. Javed feels he is able to do so,
    Mr. Javed may conduct that cross-examination on behalf of Mr. Imona-Russel. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Since Mr. Javed is not counsel for Mr.
    Imona-Russel, Mr. Imona-Russel may ask any further questions, if he wishes to
    do so, after Mr. Javed has conducted the cross-examination. That will be with
    the exception, of course, of the evidence of the complainant, where there will
    be no such right for an accused to cross-examine the complainant directly.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>To ensure that this expanded role of <i>Amicus</i> does not become blurred, we will approach each witness separately. With each
    Crown witness Mr. Imona-Russel will have to decide whether he wishes to
    cross-examine himself or he wishes the assistance of Mr. Javed, the <i>Amicus</i> to the Court. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>I am satisfied
    that if we deal with <i>Amicus</i> in a fluid fashion such as this, submissions
    can be made on each witness to ensure that Mr. Imona-Russel receives a fair
    trial and receives the benefit of assistance where necessary with any of the
    witnesses. </span></p>

    appointing counsel under a <em>Rowbotham</em> order is necessary for a fair
    trial on a case-specific basis, having regard to relevant factors, including the
    seriousness of the charges, the likelihood of imprisonment, the length and
    complexity of the proceedings in terms of the factual evidence, and the
    procedural, evidentiary and substantive law that would apply. The judge must
    also attend to the possibility of specialized procedures such as <em>voir dires</em>,
    and the accused’s personal ability to participate effectively in defending the
    case: <em>Rushlow</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, at</span></em> paras. 19-20. The trial judge has an obligation to assist unrepresented counsel,

    that if </span></em><em>amicus</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> were

    out, in my view fairly, that: “</span></em>Justice McMahon … was actually at
    first quite leery of an expanded <i>amicus</i> role, and was very careful to do
    it on an as-needed basis … [he] was very careful to explain that for each
    witness we were going to have this discussion, and to … emphasize for Mr.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the parties first discussed the possibility of creating an
    expanded role for <em>amicus</em>, the trial judge observed that the case law
    directs that “<em>amicus </em>isn’t counsel for the accused” and opined that he
    could not “indirectly” make <em>amicus </em>into defence counsel. Later, he
    explained to the appellant that communications with <em>amicus </em>would be
    privileged “just as if he was your lawyer, although he’s not”. It would have
    been preferable for the trial judge to have used the word “confidential”
    instead of “privileged.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the course of the proceedings, it became clear that the
    appellant did not simply want an expanded role for <em>amicus</em>, but wanted <em>amicus </em>to be converted to defence counsel. In his ruling on the role of <em>amicus</em>,
    the trial judge said that he was “not satisfied that it is appropriate to
    appoint Mr. Javed as trial counsel and relinquish his role as <i>Amicus</i>”,
    and went on to expand the role of <em>amicus </em>“[w]hile recognizing that <i>Amicus</i> is not counsel to the accused”. He concluded: “So it is clear, Mr. Javed, in
    his role of <i>Amicus</i>, will not be counsel for Mr. Imona-Russel.”</p>

    disagreed with <em>amicus</em><span lang=EN-GB>’s draft submissions, he was
    allowed to do so and </span><em>amicus</em><span lang=EN-GB> made additional legal

    to remove Mr. Javed as <em>amicus </em>for an alleged conflict. Once again, the
    trial judge reiterated that Mr. Javed “is not counsel to Mr. Imona. He is
    counsel to the Court, albeit I have given him an expanded role to assist Mr.
    Imona”. Both <i>amicus </i>and the appellant made sentencing submissions.</p>

    stage that he wanted to make the argument himself because he disagreed with </span><em>amicus</em><span

    made legal submissions. He returned for the sentencing stage. </span><em>Amicus</em><span

    counsel on an unwilling accused; here the appellant asked that </span><em>amicus</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-GB>be appointed as his counsel. The role played by </span><em>amicus</em><span
lang=EN-GB> was clearly defined, and was explained to and understood by the
    appellant. </span><em>Amicus’</em><span lang=EN-GB>s duties were owed to the
    court alone and he remained after the falling out with the appellant. Here the
    Attorney General consented to the terms of the order appointing </span><em>amicus</em><span
