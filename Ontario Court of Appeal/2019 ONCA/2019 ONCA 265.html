  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The explosion in the volume and variety of
    online consumer transactions over the past decade has included the emergence of
    an online market for the purchase and sale of prescription eye glasses and
    contact lenses (“prescription eyewear”). In some jurisdictions, friction has
    emerged between the online vendors of such products and the professional health
    care bodies that historically have regulated the sale of eye glasses and
    contact lenses. This case involves one instance of that friction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant, Essilor Group Canada Inc.
    (“Essilor”), a federally incorporated company, is a subsidiary of Essilor
    International Compagnie Générale d’Optique S.A., one of the largest
    manufacturers of ophthalmic lenses in the world. Essilor operates at both the
    wholesale and retail levels. As a wholesaler, Essilor supplies lenses to
    Ontario optometrists and opticians. Since 2014, Essilor has carried on business
    as an online retailer of contact lenses and eye glasses, a result of its
    acquisition of Clearly Contacts Ltd. and Coastal Contacts Inc. Those two
    companies now operate as divisions of Essilor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Essilor’s head office is located in Quebec.
    However, the online business of Essilor’s Clearly and Coastal divisions is
    conducted in British Columbia through their websites clearly.ca and coastal.com
    (the “Websites”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The respondents, the College of Optometrists of
    Ontario and the College of Opticians of Ontario, are self-governing
    professional regulatory bodies pursuant to the <em>Regulated Health Professions
    Act</em>, <i>1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 18 (“<em>RHPA</em>”). The regulatory
    scheme in which they operate will be described in detail later in these
    reasons. Briefly, under their respective statutes – the <em>Optometry Act, 1991</em>,
    S.O. 1991, c. 35 and the <em>Opticianry Act, 1991</em>, S.O. 1991, c. 34 – the
    Colleges regulate the practices of optometry and opticianry. The scope of each
    regulated practice includes the dispensing of subnormal vision devices, contact
    lenses, and eye glasses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Prior to its acquisition in April 2014 by
    Essilor, Clearly had sold contact lenses online to Ontario customers since 2000
    and eye glasses since 2008.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On September 3, 2014, the Registrars of both
    Colleges wrote a joint letter to Essilor alleging that the company was engaged
    in unlawful behaviour “by dispensing prescription eyewear through the Internet
    to Ontario consumers without involving an Ontario-licensed health care
    provider.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Discussions then ensued amongst Essilor, the
    Colleges, and the Ontario associations of optometrists and opticians. No
    agreement was reached.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On December 13, 2016, the Colleges commenced
    this application against Essilor. The Colleges allege that Essilor is in breach
    of the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27 by accepting orders for prescription eyewear through
    the Websites and shipping the eyewear to patients in Ontario. In the application,
    the Colleges seek: (i) a declaration that the company had breached s. 27 of the <em>RHPA</em> “by dispensing, for vision or eye problems, subnormal vision
    devices, contact lenses and/or eye glasses, in Ontario”; and (ii) an injunction
    prohibiting Essilor from engaging in such dispensing “except where the
    dispensing is performed by a Member [of the Colleges] or a Member’s delegate”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>By order dated January 11, 2018, the application
    judge granted the requested declaration and injunction. He made two key
    findings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>First, he held that “[i]n substance Coastal and
    Clearly are dispensing eyewear to those who require corrective lenses to assist
    with less than perfect vision”: at para. 73. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Second, the application judge considered the
    constitutional principles set out in <i>Unifund Assurance Co. v. Insurance
    Corp. of British Columbia</i>, 2003 SCC 40, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 63, regarding the
    applicability of provincial legislation to an out-of-province defendant, such
    as Essilor. He concluded, at para. 90, that a sufficient connection exists
    between Ontario and Essilor’s conduct to fall within the prohibition contained
    in s. 27 of the <i>RHPA</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>In this case prescription eyewear is ordered
    by people in Ontario. It is delivered to them in Ontario. Presumably it is to
    be used by them while resident in Ontario. This represents a sufficient
    connection to Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Essilor appeals. For the reasons set out below,
    I would allow the appeal. I conclude that the application judge incorrectly
    held that ss. 27(1) and (2) of the <i>RHPA</i> are constitutionally applicable
    to Essilor’s online sales of prescription eyewear to customers in Ontario. The
    mere delivery in Ontario of an order for prescription eyewear that has been
    processed in compliance with the British Columbia regulatory regime, without
    more, does not establish a sufficient connection between Essilor’s online sales
    and the controlled acts proscribed by the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(1).</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-GB><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>THE BUSINESS OF ESSILOR</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Canadian market for prescription eyewear is
    large. Estimates in 2016 pegged contact lens sales at $324 million and the sale
    of spectacles – frames, lenses, sunglasses and ready-made reading glasses – at
    $4.2 billion. In 2014, it was estimated that 4% of retail spectacle and contact
    lens sales occur online in Canada. According to Essilor’s evidence, other vendors
    sell eyewear online in Ontario: eleven sell contact lenses online; four sell
    eye glasses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Essilor describes online sales as “only a small
    fraction of the retail market for corrective lenses, but a growing one”;
    opticians and optometrists “operating out of traditional physical offices and
    stores still dominate the market for corrective lenses in Canada.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Essilor, through Clearly, operates a few
    bricks-and-mortar stores: two in Vancouver and one in Toronto. An optician and
    a contract optometrist work at the Toronto store; both are members of their
    respective Colleges.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Clearly’s online retail business is based in
    British Columbia and operates in accordance with British Columbia laws and
    regulations. Located in British Columbia are: Clearly’s head office and
    management team, its lab, distribution centre, and warehouse. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Clearly accepts and fills online orders in the
    following fashion:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(i)</span><span lang=EN-GB>       A customer makes an online
    purchase of eye glasses or contact lenses from Clearly through the Websites,
    which are hosted by a service in Texas. Once a customer places an order, all
    order information, apart from credit card information and customer data is
    stored on servers at Clearly’s Vancouver office;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(ii)</span><span lang=EN-GB>      To order eye glasses or contact
    lenses online through Clearly’s Websites, customers must enter their
    prescription information and, in the case of eye glasses, their pupillary
    distance. Clearly does not conduct eye exams or issue prescriptions. Although
    customers are not required to provide copies of their prescriptions when ordering
    online, they must accept Clearly’s Terms and Conditions of Use, which require
    customers to certify that they have valid prescriptions for the lenses they are
    ordering;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(iii)</span><span lang=EN-GB>     Sometimes optometrists do not
    include pupillary distance as part of a prescription. Clearly does not measure
    customers’ pupillary distances, but its Websites contain information about how
    customers can measure the distance themselves; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(iv)</span><span lang=EN-GB>     Clearly’s Vancouver office issues
    an electronic invoice to the customer; online payments are processed through a
    third party in Montreal;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(v)</span><span lang=EN-GB>      When an online order is received
    and accepted in British Columbia, it is sent by Clearly’s Vancouver
    administrative office to its Vancouver lab and distribution centre for
    processing. In the case of eye glasses, Clearly orders the components for
    frames and lenses from outside Canada. The eye glasses are assembled either in
    Clearly’s Vancouver lab or at an Essilor partner lab outside of Canada. In the
    case of contact lenses, Clearly sources them from manufacturers in the United
    States and maintains an inventory of lenses at its Vancouver warehouse. About
    80% of contact lens customers are supplied from product in inventory;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(vi)</span><span lang=EN-GB>     Clearly ships finished eye glasses
    and contact lenses to customers from its British Columbia distribution centre;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(vii)</span><span lang=EN-GB>    Clearly operates a call centre in
    Vancouver to address customer questions. An optician who is a member of the
    British Columbia College of Opticians is on staff;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>(viii)</span><span lang=EN-GB>    The Vancouver office processes all
    returns.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Where a customer in Ontario buys prescription
    eyewear online from Clearly, only two steps in the transaction touch upon
    Ontario: (i) the customer enters the order online from a device in Ontario; and
    (ii) Clearly arranges for the delivery of the eyewear to the customer at a
    location in Ontario.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As the description of Essilor’s mode of online
    business discloses, British Columbia is the company’s principal place of
    business. As well, the terms and conditions posted on Clearly’s Websites state
    that services provided through the sites are governed by the laws of British
    Columbia and applicable federal laws. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>There is no dispute that Essilor’s method for
    selling prescription eyewear is authorized by the law of British Columbia. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>The situation prior to 2010</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>That was not always the case. In 2008, the
    College of Opticians of British Columbia sought a court order to prohibit
    Clearly from selling or dispensing contact lenses online to individuals in
    British Columbia. Clearly successfully resisted the application in the court of
    first instance: <em>College of Opticians of British Columbia v. Coastal
    Contacts Inc.</em>, 2008 BCSC 617. However, in 2009 the British Columbia Court

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    clinician identified, not just the information contained in the prescription.
    Second, the associations wanted Clearly to deliver orders to an optometrist’s
    or optician’s office or retail store, not directly to the consumers’ homes. An

  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>Later formulations of the

    increase the potential amongst the provinces for conflict. Nevertheless, the
    collective interests of the federation as a whole required the adoption of
    principles of order and fairness that ensure the security of transactions with
    justice: at paras. 68 and 74. In a federal system, that includes avoiding
    competing exercises of regulatory regimes, the cost of which undermines
    economic efficiency: at para. 71. Those considerations led the court to

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Consideration of constitutional <i>applicability</i> can conveniently be organized around the following propositions:</span></p>

    the leading case on what the “dispensing” of prescription eyewear means. But, <em>Wadden</em> was decided in 2001, before the emergence of a robust market in online
    commerce. The decision’s language indicates that the movement from in-person to
    online purchases of prescription eyewear was not foreseen at that time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    dispensing prescription eyewear, including providing prescription eyewear by
    means of online transactions. While the Standards are not determinative of the

    of Practice </em>published by the College of Optometrists address in some
    detail the process of dispensing prescription eyewear online. Standard 6.4,
    concerning “Spectacle Therapy”, contains the College’s Internet Therapy
    Standard, reproduced as Appendix B to these reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Internet Therapy Standard defines dispensing
    as “the preparation, adaptation and delivery” of vision correction. It
    identifies eight steps or stages in the process of providing prescription
    eyewear online. The standard provides that an optometrist should: (i) review
    with the patient factors affecting spectacle wear; (ii) review the details of
    the prescription; (iii) advise the patient regarding appropriate ophthalmic
    materials; (iv) take appropriate measurements; (v) arrange for the fabrication
    of the spectacles; (vi) verify the accuracy of the completed spectacles; (vii)
    fit or adjust the spectacles to the patient; and (viii) counsel the patient
    regarding spectacle wear. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Of the eight steps described, two concern
    dealings with the manufacturer of the eyewear. The other six involve
    communications with the patient. Of those six, the Internet Therapy Standard
    states that five can be performed without requiring the personal attendance of
    the patient. For those stages of the process, the optometrist may use various
    forms of electronic or online communication. For example, an optometrist may
    take appropriate measurements in-person or by in-office or remote computer
    applications. The specifics of other online means of communication can be found
    in the Internet Therapy Standard at Appendix B to these reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The only step for which the Internet Therapy
    Standard requires a personal attendance by the patient is the penultimate one:
    the “fitting or adjusting the spectacles to the patient”. The standard offers
    the following rationale for this requirement:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>In-person fitting and adjusting of spectacles
    provides a final verification and mitigates risk of harm by confirming that
    patients leave the clinic with spectacles that have been properly verified, fit
    and adjusted. In-person delivery of spectacles establishes a
    patient/practitioner relationship in circumstances where patients are new to
    the clinic and spectacle therapy was initiated through the optometrist’s
    website. </span></p>

    Opticians in the Province of Ontario</em> contain a definition of “dispensing”
    similar to that used by the Optometrists Standard. The Opticians Standards
    contain separate sections for the dispensing of eye glasses and contact lenses.
    While expressed in somewhat different terms than in the Optometrists Standards,
    the “continuum of activities” is functionally similar.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    guidelines for the online dispensing of prescription eyewear similar to those
    used by the optometrists. The College of Opticians’ <em>Practice Guidelines</em> only briefly address the use of technology. Nonetheless, they share common
    ground with the Optometrists Standards in that the final step on the continuum
    of activities – the delivery of the prescription eyewear – must be done in
    person. And therein lies the point of conflict between the parties in this
    proceeding.</span></p>

    Instead, it relies on the information contained in the prescription and
    provided by the customer. It should be noted that the British Columbia
    regulatory regime sets a higher health care standard for the content of
    prescriptions for eye glasses than does Ontario. In British Columbia, an
    optometrist must include in a prescription the person’s interpupillary
    distance: <em>Optometrists Regulation</em>, s. 6(4)(e). No similar standard

lang=EN-GB>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The application judge explained the basis for
    his finding at two places in his reasons. First, at paras. 65 and 66 he stated,
    in part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Obviously, the respondent is making
    eyeglasses. It is filling prescriptions and delivering eyewear. This is enough
    to show that the respondent is dispensing eyewear. If it is necessary to go
    further, it is reasonable to infer, as I do, that the respondent “dispensed”
    the eyeglasses delivered to the three [investigatory] “customers”. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, I find that the respondent has
    acted contrary to the requirements of s. 27 of the <i>Regulated Health
    Professions Act</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Yet, the evidence clearly shows that Essilor
    makes eye glasses – in the sense of assembling or preparing them for shipment –
    at its British Columbia facilities. As well, Essilor fills the prescriptions at
    and ships the finished eyewear from its British Columbia facilities. None of
    that activity constitutes the performance of a controlled act in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>However, the application judge returned to the
    issue of the violation of the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(1) later in his reasons where,
    at para. 90, he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-GB>In this case prescription eyewear is ordered by people in Ontario.
    It is delivered to them in Ontario. Presumably it is to be used by them while
    resident in Ontario.</span></span><span lang=EN-GB> This represents a
    sufficient connection to Ontario. To find otherwise would mean the eyeglasses
    are provided without obligation to adhere to Ontario regulation. <u>Ordering
    eyeglasses is the catalyst for, and delivery is part of, dispensing the
    eyewear; indicating that it is at least part of a “controlled act” as defined
    in s. 27(2) of the&nbsp;<em>Regulated Health Professions Act</em></u><em>.</em> [emphasis added]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In the application judge’s view, the online
    ordering of prescription eyewear from a device located in Ontario and its
    delivery to a person in Ontario amount to the performance by Essilor of
    controlled acts contrary to s. 27(1) of the <em>RHPA</em>: at para. 66. I shall
    examine each finding in turn.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-GB>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>There is no dispute that in most cases a
    customer in Ontario uses a device located in Ontario to access Essilor’s Websites
    and place an online order. However, the customer’s inputting of information
    into the Websites and transmission of that order information to Essilor is not
    part of a “controlled act” within the meaning of the <em>RHPA</em> ss. 27 for
    the simple reason that the act is performed by the customer, not by the person
    – Essilor – who provides the health care service to the individual. I accept
    Essilor’s submission that the proscription contained in the <em>RHPA</em> s.
    27(1) is directed at the supplier of a health care service or product, not at
    the consumer patient. Section 27(1) of the <em>RHPA</em> and the <i>RHPA</i> <em>Code</em> do not vest the Colleges with the authority to seek to restrain acts taken by
    the consumer of health care services: see also <em>Ordre des optométrists du
    Québec c. Coastal Contacts Inc.</em>, 2016 QCCA 837, leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused, 2017 CanLII 442 (SCC), at para. 25. Accordingly, the fact that a
    customer places an order from an Ontario-located device cannot support a
    finding that Essilor performs the controlled act of dispensing in Ontario. </span></p>

    the application judge – delivery – at this point it would be appropriate to
    consider a related submission forcefully advanced by Essilor, both below and on
    appeal: by “selling” prescription eyewear to individuals in Ontario, Essilor is
    not engaged in the act of “dispensing”. Considering the submission at this
    stage will shed some light on the nature of prescription eyewear transactions
    which, in turn, will assist in assessing whether “delivery” falls on the “continuum
    of activities” making up “dispensing” within the meaning of the <em>RHPA </em>s.

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>The decision of the application judge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At para. 54 of his reasons, the application
    judge distinguished dispensing from selling:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>“Dispensing” is
    qualitatively different from “selling”, the term that was central to the
    rationale in <em>Ordres des optometristes du Quebec v. Coastal Contacts Inc</em>.
    “Selling” is commerce. “Dispensing”, however, refers to acts that respond to
    problem eye sight (“prescribing”, “preparing”, “fitting”, “adjusting”,
    “adapting”): that is, health care. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Nonetheless, in the result the application judge
    appeared to favour the Colleges’ argument that the act of “selling” was
    subsumed within “dispensing”, although he did not definitively decide that
    issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Essilor stresses that “selling” is not
    “dispensing” within the meaning of the <em>RHPA</em> s. 27(2)9. It bases its
    argument on the maxim of statutory interpretation that the express mention of
    one thing means the implied exclusion of another: specifically, that because s.
    27(2)8 of the <em>RHPA</em> refers to both “dispensing” and “selling” in
    describing the controlled act for drugs, while s. 27(2)9 only speaks of
    “dispensing” in the case of prescription eyewear, it must follow that the term
    “dispensing” when used in respect of eyewear does not include the “selling” of
    eyewear. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The application judge rejected that argument,
    noting that there was a need for the inclusion of the additional term “selling”
    in respect of the drugs covered by 27(2)8 because some drugs do not require a
    prescription yet still are subject to professional supervision when sold. But,
    that is not the case for prescription eyewear: at para. 63. The application
    judge appropriately explained how the implied exclusion maxim was rebutted in
    those circumstances: <em>Schnarr v. Blue Mountain Resorts Limited</em>, 2018
    ONCA 313, 140 O.R. (3d) 82, at para. 57, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Essilor’s submission misses the mark for a more
    fundamental reason. Optometrists and opticians do not provide prescription
    eyewear for free. A patient must pay a price for the eyewear before walking out
    of the office with the product. As a matter of common experience, the
    dispensing of prescription eyewear involves the commercial sale of a product,
    albeit a health care product. Indeed, the core dispute in this case revolves
    around the comparative prices at which Essilor and members of the Colleges
    provide prescription eyewear to the public.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>While that disposes of Essilor’s “selling is not
    dispensing” argument, its submission does highlight that the provision of
    prescription eyewear is a transaction with both health care and commercial
    aspects. This has been recognized by prescription eyewear professionals
    themselves, as well as by the Quebec courts in litigation brought against
    Essilor’s Coastal division in that province by the Quebec professional
    regulator.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The 2014 discussion paper prepared by an expert
    panel struck by the Canadian Association of Optometrists – <em>Pathways to the
    Future</em> – recognized the commercial dimension of providing prescription
    eyewear, and the attendant market pressures that dimension exerts on the
    traditional channels of selling eyewear through regulated health care
    professionals. At p. 12, the paper states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>In reality, many of the services provided
    today are loss leaders that support the retail business. Thus, the product
    aspect of the business – which historically has helped shape the profession –
    should be retained as part of the business model, even in the light of ongoing
    competition from big box retailers and mass merchandisers offering discounted
    eyewear and a limited eye exam.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The opportunity in retail for [optometrists]
    is to differentiate by offering the aging population a more sophisticated array
    of tools and supports (for example, eSight). In addition, [optometrists] will
    retain their current patient-centred approach, offering a range of retail
    products to suit the priorities and interests of their patient base and target
    audience, with varying price ranges and strategic marketing messages. However,
    the expected increased competition in prescription eyewear and contact lens
    sales highlights the need for [optometrists] to adopt more proficient business
    practices. </span></p>

    the College’s application: 2014 QCCS 5886. He concluded that the online
    contract for the “sale” of ophthalmic lenses to a Quebec resident was made in
    British Columbia and governed by the law of that province. While the motion
    judge acknowledged, at para. 52, that the contract between an optometrist and
    his customer contains a professional health services aspect, he continued, at
    paras. 53 and 54, by writing:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>[Translation] The law also reserves “<i>an act

    economic monopoly on professionals.</span></p>

    College’s appeal, rejecting its primary argument that the word “sale” in the
    relevant provision of the <em>LSO</em> also covered the “distribution” of
    ophthalmic lenses in Quebec. In the course of its reasons, the Quebec Court of
    Appeal stated, at paras. 70 and 71:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>[Translation] Finally, I would note that the
    Supreme Court teaches us that statutes that create professional monopolies

    defended may be performed with impunity by those who are not part of these

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>As a result, it
    is my opinion that the appellant has not demonstrated that protection of the

    prescription eyewear is more than the simple delivery of a thing; it is an

lang=EN-GB>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I am persuaded by the Colleges’ submission that
    the delivery of prescription eyewear falls within the continuum of activities
    that make up the “dispensing” of such eyewear. It is difficult to see how a
    person can dispense prescription eyewear without delivering it. The transaction
    would remain incomplete until delivery was made, and the customer/patient would
    not obtain the benefit of the prescription eyewear until received.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>However, that, in itself, would not lead me to
    conclude, as did the application judge at para. 66 of his reasons, that by
    delivering prescription eyewear to an Ontario customer in fulfilment of an
    online order Essilor acts contrary to the requirements of s. 27 of the <em>RHPA</em>.
    If all the acts along the “continuum of activities”, including delivery, were
    performed by a person situated in Ontario, whether the order was placed
    in-person or online, then a violation of s. 27(1) of the <i>RHPA</i> would be
    made out. But here, all the acts performed to fill an online order but one –
    delivery – are performed out-of-province. To find a violation of the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(1), a sufficient connection with Ontario must be demonstrated. I turn now
    to that key issue.</span></p>

    connection required to establish a “sufficient connection” with Ontario under
    the <em>Unifund</em> test. Essilor submits that for a sufficient connection to
    exist, all aspects of the controlled act must take place in Ontario, whereas
    the Colleges contend that as long as some part of a controlled act occurs in
    Ontario, a sufficient connection exists.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I am not persuaded by either submission.
    Ascertaining whether a sufficient connection exists does not involve a numeric
    comparison of the acts Essilor performs in British Columbia with those in
    Ontario to provide prescription eyewear to an Ontario customer. A single act,
    such as delivery, may establish a sufficient connection, or it may not. The <em>Unifund</em> test requires a more qualitative inquiry into the relationship among the
    enacting jurisdiction, the subject matter of the legislation, and the
    individual or entity sought to be regulated.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>First, in finding the existence of a sufficient
    connection, the application judge erred in concluding that the placement of an
    online order by a customer in Ontario constitutes part of a controlled act
    performed by Essilor. It does not; it is an act of the customer, not an act of
    Essilor. As a result, it cannot form part of the controlled act of dispensing
    by Essilor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Further, while the application judge correctly
    identified the purpose of the <i>RHPA</i> as regulating the nature and quality
    of health care services in order to protect the public, he did not acknowledge
    that some aspects of the “continuum of activities” constituting “dispensing”
    possess a commercial aspect involving no application of professional health
    care skills. The simple act of delivery of finished prescription eyewear,
    without more, is one such commercial aspect. And that is Essilor’s sole
    connection with Ontario in the case of its online sales.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>As well, the application judge erred in his
    characterization of the purpose of the British Columbia regulatory regime,
    leading him to discount the fact that Essilor operates in compliance with the
    health care standards set by another Canadian province. The application judge
    concluded that the 2010 amendments to the British Columbia regulatory scheme
    changed its purpose from protecting health care to enhancing competition and consumer
    choice stating, at para. 92.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>It is not clear to me how this change
    maintained “public safety” but it does not matter. What is clear is that the
    purpose behind the regulatory scheme in British Columbia changed. As noted by
    the respondent in its factum, British Columbia encourages online selling to
    enhance competition and consumer choice. That is different from the regulatory
    approach in Ontario. Here, the central purpose is health care. There is no
    justification for imposing the purpose of health professions legislation from
    British Columbia on those who reside in Ontario. To my mind, that would be a
    questionable breach of the territorial jurisdiction defined by Canada’s federal
    system of government.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The evidentiary record did not disclose any shift
    in legislative purpose resulting from the 2010 amendments. Those amendments did
    not alter the statutory duties set out in s. 16(1) of the British Columbia <em>Health
    Professions Act.</em> It remains the duty of a college, such as the College of
    Optometrists and the College of Opticians, “at all times (a) to serve and
    protect the public, and (b) to exercise its powers and discharge its
    responsibilities under all enactments in the public interest.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The distinctive feature of this case is that
    Essilor, as the online provider of prescription eyewear, operates out of a
    Canadian province that maintains a regulated health professions regime which
    closely resembles that in Ontario, save for the manner of selling prescription
    eyewear online. Essilor complies with the health care standards set by the
    British Columbia regulatory regime for the provision of prescription eyewear.
    The steps Essilor performs to meet those regulatory health care standards take
    place in British Columbia prior to the delivery of the product out-of-province.
    Given those circumstances, I would not regard the commercial act of the
    physical delivery of product ordered online to the customer in Ontario, without
    more, as establishing a “sufficient connection” with Ontario upon which to
    apply the controlled health care act proscriptions of the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(1)
    to Essilor’s online transactions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>However, two other arguments must be addressed.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Essilor’s Toronto bricks-and-mortar store</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>First, the Colleges point to the presence of Essilor’s
    bricks-and-mortar store in Toronto as an indicia of a sufficient connection
    with Ontario. In their application, the Colleges do not allege that the store
    operates in contravention of the <i>RHPA</i>. However, they submit that the
    store “funnels customers into the online store to complete purchases via
    in-store computers,” thereby using staff on the ground in Ontario to solicit
    business for Essilor’s Websites. That activity, the Colleges argue,
    demonstrates a sufficient connection with Ontario to apply the <i>RHPA</i> s.
    27(1) to Essilor’s online prescription eyewear business.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>On the record before the court, I am not persuaded by that argument.
    I acknowledge that in <i>Unifund</i> the absence of certain factors played a
    large role in leading the Supreme Court to conclude that no sufficient
    connection existed between Ontario and the Insurance Corporation of British
    Columbia (“ICBC”). At paras. 82 and 84, the court stated, in part: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The respondent, Unifund, points to the fact that the payments
    for which reimbursement is claimed were paid in Ontario by an Ontario insurer
    to an Ontario resident. This is true, but it leaves out of consideration the
    relationship between Ontario and the party sought to be made to pay, the
    out-of-province [ICBC]. <u>Not only is the [ICBC] not authorized to sell
    insurance in Ontario, it does not in fact do so</u>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>Here, unlike [<i>R. v. Thomas Equipment Ltd.</i>, [1979] 2
    S.C.R. 529], the [ICBC] had not hired anyone in Ontario to promote its
    products. It was not in the Ontario marketplace</u> and, in my view, it was not
    required to “comply with the rules of the [Ontario] game”.&nbsp;The decision of
    the Ontario legislature to impose no-fault benefits on Unifund could not be
    bootstrapped into legislative jurisdiction to impose a corresponding debt on
    the [ICBC], which (leaving aside the PAU argument) was beyond the territorial
    jurisdiction of the province. [emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>In one respect, Essilor stands in a different relationship with
    Ontario than did the ICBC in the <i>Unifund</i> case because it operates a
    bricks-and-mortar store in Toronto. However, the only evidence adduced by the
    Colleges of an online purchase of prescription eyewear through Essilor’s
    bricks-and-mortar Toronto store came from one of the investigators retained by
    the Colleges, Ms. Tiffany O’Hearn Davies. She deposed that: she attended the
    store where a clerk assisted her in placing an online order; the clerk asked to
    see a copy of her prescription; the clerk referred her to a registered
    optician, who measured her pupillary distance; she asked to pick up the glasses
    at the store; and, when she did, a clerk directed her to the registered
    optician for a fitting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The Colleges do not allege that the evidence of the investigator’s
    in-store placement of an online order discloses a contravention of the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(1). A registered optician was involved in the in-store transaction
    described by the investigator. Essilor’s in-store regulatory-compliant
    transactions cannot establish the sufficient connection required to apply the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(1) to Essilor’s general online prescription eyewear business through its
    Websites, which is the focus of the Colleges’ allegations in this application.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The “sufficient connection by omission” argument</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB style='background:white'>The second argument is what I would
    describe as an attempt to apply the constitutional principle of sufficient
    connection to omissions, or acts not performed, by the out-of-province entity –
    what I would term a “sufficient connection by omission” argument.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB style='background:white'>The context for this argument is the fact
    that when Essilor delivers prescription eyewear into Ontario in fulfilment of
    an online order placed through its Websites, it does not conduct any fitting or
    adjustment of the delivered product. That is a result of the British Columbia
    health professions regulatory regime that </span><span lang=EN-GB>authorizes
    the online supply of prescription eyewear without the need for an in-person
    fitting or adjustment upon delivery provided two conditions are met. The first
    condition is a positive one: in the case of eyeglasses, the supplier must have the
    individual’s authorizing document – either a prescription from an optometrist
    or qualified medical practitioner or an assessment record produced by an
    independent automated refraction conducted by an authorized person; or, in the
    case of a contact lens, the contact lens record prepared by a person authorized
    to fit a contact lens. The second condition is a negative one: the supplier
    cannot dispense if an assessment record indicates refractive errors or changes
    in refractive errors of a prescribed magnitude. Provided it meets those
    conditions, Essilor complies with the British Columbia regulatory regime by
    shipping prescription eyewear to a customer in fulfilment of an online order
    without providing the service of fitting or adjusting the delivered product. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB style='background:white'>However, the application judge observed
    that under the Ontario regulatory regime, dispensing includes the fitting and
    adjustment of prescription eyewear to ensure the products carry out their
    corrective function.<a name="_Hlk4686256"> Because Essilor does not fit or
    adjust the delivered product, </a>the application judge queried, at paras. 70
    and 71 of his reasons, how the law dealt with Essilor’s submission that it is
    not obliged to fulfil the responsibilities of fitting and adjusting. At para.
    90 of his reasons, the application judge offered a partial answer to his
    question by holding that the delivery of prescription eyewear to a person in
    Ontario represented a sufficient connection to Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The Colleges also hint at a “sufficient connection by omission”
    argument. They contend that by delivering prescription eyewear in Ontario
    without providing an in-person fitting or adjustment to the customer, Essilor
    somehow establishes a sufficient connection with Ontario for purposes of the <i>RHPA</i>.
    In their factum, the Colleges submit that a wide view must be taken of the
    concept of sufficient connection. Such a view goes beyond simply asking whether
    there is a connection between Ontario and the steps Essilor actually performs.
    The Colleges argue that the sufficient connection analysis must take into
    account the broader health protection purposes of the <i>RHPA</i> in assessing
    whether it applies to Essilor’s provision of health care devices to Ontario
    residents. This would include the need for a registered optometrist or optician
    to fit or adjust ordered prescription eyewear before a customer could leave
    with the product. Essilor’s failure to do so, the Colleges contend, is one
    factor that supports the existence of a sufficient connection to apply the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27 to Essilor’s online provision of prescription eyewear through its
    Websites.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>I am not persuaded by the “sufficient connection by omission”
    argument. In the circumstances of this case, acceding to such an argument would
    effectively prohibit Ontario consumers from purchasing prescription eyewear
    online from a supplier in another province, where the supplier has complied
    with that province’s health professions regulatory regime, unless delivery of
    the product is channelled through the office of an Ontario optometrist or
    optician. Applying the constitutional principle of territorial limits on the
    scope of provincial legislative authority in that way would in effect sanction
    the creation of a monopoly over the importation of prescription eyewear into
    Ontario from other provinces. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Indeed, that is how the College of Optometrists has drafted its
    Internet Therapy Standard. Under that Standard, all steps in the purchase of
    prescription eyewear, but one, can be done online. The one step that requires
    an in-person attendance by the customer is the delivery of the prescription eyewear.
    The Standard effectively funnels the delivery of all prescription eyewear
    through the businesses of Ontario optometrists and opticians.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>I am not prepared to apply the sufficient connection principle to
    work such a result in the absence of clear language in Ontario legislation
    requiring it.  Put another way, if the Ontario Legislature wishes to compel
    Ontario consumers to attend the office of an Ontario optometrist or optician in
    order to pick up prescription eyewear that the consumer has ordered online from
    a regulatory-compliant supplier in another Canadian province, then the Ontario
    Legislature must use clear statutory language imposing such a restriction on
    Ontario consumers.<u>  </u></span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-GB>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The other jurisprudence relied upon by the Colleges and the
    application judge</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>In my view, that conclusion is not altered by the other cases upon
    which the  application judge drew to support his conclusion that a sufficient
    connection to Ontario existed to support the application of the <em>RHPA</em> s. 27 to Essilor’s online sales through its Websites: <em>Celgene</em>; <em>Global
    Pharmacy</em>; <em>Torudag v. British Columbia (Securities Commission)</em>,
    2011 BCCA 458, 343 D.L.R. (4th) 743, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2012]

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The Colleges agree with the application judge’s use of these cases;
    Essilor either distinguishes them or draws from them other principles in
    support of its position. While each case illustrates, in a different way, the
    challenges posed by online transactions to various kinds of regulatory or
    judicial activity, they provide little in the way of concrete guidance for the
    present case. Nevertheless, since the parties and the application judge rely on
    them, let me consider each briefly.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Celgene</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-GB>Celgene</span></em><span lang=EN-GB> considered the supportability
    of a decision of the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board under the <em>Patent
    Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4. Under the Act, a “patentee” was required to
    provide the Board with prescribed information respecting “the price at which
    the medicine is being or has been sold in any market in Canada and elsewhere”.
    Celgene distributed the drug Thalomid. The company was located in New Jersey.
    However, it obtained a Canadian patent for the drug, thereby becoming a
    “patentee”. At that point, the Board requested pricing information about
    Celgene’s sale of the drug from New Jersey into Canada. Celgene refused, taking
    the position that under commercial law principles its sales to Canadian
    customers were made in New Jersey. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The Board held that because its mandate included protecting
    Canadians from excessive drug prices, sales “in any market in Canada” included
    sales of medicine regulated by Canadian law that would be delivered and used in
    Canada. The Supreme Court acknowledged that while the language of selling “in
    any market in Canada” could lend itself to different interpretations, it
    accepted the Board’s interpretation of the phrase. Critical to the court’s
    conclusion was its view that the Board was justified in taking into account
    “its responsibility for ensuring that the monopoly that accompanies the
    granting of a [Canadian] patent is not abused to the financial detriment of
    Canadian patients and their insurers”: at paras. 29 and 30.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>The Quebec Court of Appeal, at para. 33 of <em>Ordre des
    optométrists du Québec</em>, noted the significance of the fact that Celgene

    jurisdiction over it.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Global Pharmacy</p>

lang=EN-GB>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-GB>Global Pharmacy</span></em><span lang=EN-GB> involved a complaint by
    the Ontario College of Pharmacists that certain companies were operating a
    pharmacy in Ontario without accreditation and committing related regulatory
    breaches. In general terms, the companies: accepted online orders for
    prescription drugs from customers in the United States; processed the orders,
    including payments, at an Ontario office; sub-contracted the filling of the
    orders to companies in India; and directed the Indian companies to ship the
    filled orders to the customers in the United States. At the time of the
    complaint, the companies did not sell drugs to consumers in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>This court applied the <em>Unifund</em> principles; its reasons
    disclose that the case turned on the clear findings of fact made by the
    application judge. Those findings showed that the substance of the sale
    transactions took place through an Ontario corporation that was located and
    operated in Ontario: at para. 62. A sufficient connection with Ontario existed
    because the companies’ Ontario office was “home to the only staff that deal
    with Global Pharamacy Canada customers”: at para. 71. In those circumstances,
    the Ontario College of Pharmacists had jurisdiction to regulate the sale of
    drugs by the companies to American customers. Those are quite different facts
    from those found in the present case.</span></p>

    issue was the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Securities Commission to
    conduct an administrative hearing into a series of stock purchases made by
    Torudag, which were alleged to violate provincial insider trading prohibitions.
    Torudag did not reside in British Columbia. He bought his shares through an
    online account with a brokerage based outside of British Columbia. Torudag
    argued that the Commission had no jurisdiction to proceed against him. The
    Commission held that it did, a decision upheld by the British Columbia Court of
    Appeal. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>While that court engaged in a discussion about how, in the world of
    electronic commerce, physical location can become almost incidental, with other
    factors assuming greater importance in a jurisdictional analysis, its decision
    did not turn on the nuances of online commerce: at paras. 20-22. The court
    identified two key factors that established a sufficient connection between the
    regulator and the transactions: (i) Torudag purchased shares of a company that
    was a reporting issuer in British Columbia; and (ii) his purchases were
    performed through the facilities of the TSX Venture Exchange which, under an
    agreement amongst Canadian securities administrators, was regulated by the
    British Columbia Securities Commission in order to protect the investing
    public: at para. 26. The case stands for the proposition that a securities
    commission has the jurisdiction to initiate administrative insider trader
    proceedings in respect of trades in the securities of a reporting issuer in its
    home jurisdiction, facilitated through its “home” exchange. Again, this case
    involves significantly different facts from those in the present case.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>Finally, the issue in the <em>Google</em> case was whether a British
    Columbia court had the jurisdiction to issue an interlocutory injunction
    enjoining Google from displaying any part of a defendant’s websites on any of
    its search results worldwide in order to give effect to an earlier court order
    directing the defendant to cease carrying on business through any website.
    Google contested the jurisdiction of the court to make such an order on two
    grounds: (i) the order affected a non-party to the litigation; and (ii) the
    court could not issue an injunction that had extraterritorial effect. The
    Supreme Court upheld the injunction. Although its decision commented on the new
    reality of online commerce and advertising, the court upheld the injunction
    based on the existing jurisprudence that interlocutory injunctions could bind
    non-parties and have extraterritorial effect where the issuing court had <em>in
    personam</em> jurisdiction over the defendant: at paras. 28 and 36-38.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>While all these cases discuss aspects of the challenges to
    regulating various kinds of online commercial transactions, none address
    circumstances analogous to those of the present case: i.e., whether a supplier
    of prescription eyewear that complies with the regulated health care regime of
    its “home” province performs a “controlled act” under Ontario legislation by
    delivering online-ordered eyewear to the residents of Ontario. Consequently,
    the cases provide little guidance to the specific circumstances of this case.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-GB>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Conclusion</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The key issue on this appeal concerns the territorial restrictions
    on the legislative competence of Ontario regarding the dispensing of
    prescription eyewear, specifically the constitutional application of the
    controlled act provisions of the <i>RHPA</i> to Essilor’s online sales of
    prescription eyewear through its Websites: <i>Unifund</i>, at paras. 50-56. For
    the reasons set out above, I conclude that the application judge incorrectly
    held that ss. 27(1) and (2) of the <i>RHPA</i> are constitutionally applicable
    to Essilor’s online sales of prescription eyewear to customers in Ontario: a
    customer’s placement of an order from an Ontario-located device does not amount
    to the performance by Essilor of part of the controlled act of dispensing; and,
    the mere delivery in Ontario of an order for prescription eyewear that has been
    processed in compliance with the British Columbia regulatory regime, without
    more, does not establish a sufficient connection between Essilor’s online sales
    and the controlled acts proscribed by the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In other words, the “dispensing” of prescription eyewear, as that
    term is used in the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(2), includes the “delivery” of the
    product to the patient or customer. However, the discrete act of delivering
    eyewear to a person primarily has a commercial aspect, not a health care one:
    delivery completes the order placed by the customer. Where the supplier of the
    prescription eyewear operates in another province and complies with that
    province’s health professions regulatory regime when filling an online order
    placed by an Ontario customer, the final act of delivering that product to the
    Ontario purchaser does not amount to the performance of a “controlled act” by
    the supplier within the meaning of the <i>RHPA</i> s. 27(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>That is because a sufficient connection, within the meaning of the <i>Unifund</i> analysis, does not exist between the acts of the supplier – Essilor – and the
    Ontario health professions regulatory regime to support the application of the <i>RHPA</i> to the supplier’s online sales. As explained, a finding that a sufficient
    connection exists between Essilor’s online sales through its Websites and the <i>RHPA</i>,
    on the record before this court, would amount to using Ontario’s health
    professions regulatory legislation to grant Ontario optometrists and opticians
    a monopoly over the commercial importation of prescription eyewear into
    Ontario. If the Ontario Legislature wishes to grant a commercial monopoly to
    Ontario’s optometrists and opticians over the distribution of orders for
    prescription eyewear placed online with regulatory-compliant suppliers in other
    provinces, then the Legislature must adopt language that clearly allows such a
    monopoly in order to comply with the constitutional principle of territorial
    legislative restriction. The present language of the <i>RHPA</i> ss. 27(1) and
    (2) is insufficient to do so.</span></p>
