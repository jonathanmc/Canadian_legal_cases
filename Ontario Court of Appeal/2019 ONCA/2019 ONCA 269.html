  <p class=Judge><strong>Zarnett J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A receiver is appointed under both Canada’s <em>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (“<em>BIA</em>”), and Ontario’s <em>Courts
    of Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (“<em>CJA</em>”). The receivership
    order contains a “leave to sue provision” under which the receiver cannot be
    sued without consent or leave of the court. What appeal route is available to a
    party who has been denied permission to sue? Is the appeal governed by the <em>BIA</em>,
    which provides for appeals as of right only in some cases, requires leave to
    appeal in other cases, and sets a short time limit for an appeal or a request
    for leave to appeal? Or is the appeal governed by the <i>CJA</i>, under which
    final orders may be appealed as of right to this court within a longer time
    limit than that in the<i> BIA</i>? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The moving party SusGlobal Energy Belleville
    Ltd. (“SusGlobal”) wishes to appeal orders of the Superior Court that:</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-US>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>denied SusGlobal leave to sue the responding party BDO Canada Ltd. (“BDO”)
    in its capacity as court-appointed receiver of Astoria </span>Organic Matters
    Ltd. and Astoria Organic Matters Canada LP<span lang=EN-US>; and, </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-US>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>denied SusGlobal’s request to re-open its original application for leave
    so that it could file fresh evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On a motion before a single judge of this court
    (the “chambers judge”), SusGlobal’s attempt to appeal was effectively
    terminated. The basis of the chambers judge’s decision was that the <em>BIA</em>,
    not the <em>CJA</em>, governed SusGlobal’s appeal; the provisions of the <i>BIA</i> providing for appeals as of right were not applicable to the appeal; and no grounds
    for granting leave to appeal existed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On this motion, SusGlobal challenges the
    decision of the chambers judge, raising only the issue of the correctness of
    the conclusion that the applicable appeal route is under the <i>BIA</i>, not
    the <i>CJA</i>. It argues that solely the <i>CJA</i> is applicable to its
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would dismiss SusGlobal’s motion. The proper appeal route is
    the<i> BIA</i> when the order sought to be appealed was made in reliance on
    jurisdiction under the <i>BIA</i>. That is the case here. The Superior Court
    dismissed SusGlobal’s request to sue the receiver—the dismissal SusGlobal
    wishes to appeal—in reliance on the leave to sue provision in the receivership
    order. The court’s authority to include that provision in the receivership
    order flowed by necessary implication from the statutory power to appoint a
    receiver under s.&nbsp;243(1) of the <i>BIA</i>. I recognize that the <i>CJA</i> also provided such authority as part of the statutory power in s. 101 to
    appoint a receiver. But since authority for the leave to sue provision is found
    both in the <i>BIA</i> and the <i>CJA</i>, and since the receiver was appointed
    under both statutes, the appeal is governed by the <i>BIA</i> as a matter of
    paramountcy. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Business Development Bank of Canada was a
    secured creditor of Astoria Organic Matters Ltd. and Astoria Organic Matters
    Canada LP (“Astoria”). Upon Astoria’s insolvency, the Bank applied for an order
    under s. 243(1) of the <i>BIA</i> and s. 101 of the <i>CJA</i> appointing BDO
    as receiver of Astoria. On April 13, 2017, Hainey&nbsp;J. granted that request.
    The order appointing BDO as receiver (“the receivership order”) provided in
    relevant part as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>2. THIS COURT ORDERS that pursuant to section
    243(1) of the </span>BIA<span lang=EN-US> and section 101 of the </span>CJA<span
lang=EN-US>, BDO Canada Limited is hereby appointed Receiver, without security,
    of all of the assets, undertakings and properties of the Debtors acquired for,
    or used in relation to a business carried on by the Debtors, including all
    proceeds thereof (the “Property”)…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>3. THIS COURT ORDERS that the Receiver is
    hereby empowered…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>(l) to sell, convey,
    transfer, lease or assign the Property or any part or parts thereof out of the
    ordinary course of business…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>8. THIS COURT ORDERS that no proceeding or enforcement process
    in any court or tribunal (each, a “Proceeding”), shall be commenced or
    continued against the Receiver except with the written consent of the Receiver
    or with leave of this Court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Paragraph 8, which is at the heart of this
    appeal, is identical to the paragraph of the same number included in the
    Commercial List of the Superior Court of Justice’s Model Receivership Order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>BDO, as court-appointed receiver, sold assets to
    SusGlobal under an Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 27, 2017. Shortly after
    closing SusGlobal complained about the amount of raw organic waste accumulated inside
    one of the facilities it had purchased, and the expenses of about $750,000 it
    had to incur as a consequence. SusGlobal claimed BDO had breached obligations owed
    to it and was responsible to compensate SusGlobal for its expenses. BDO denied
    responsibility on multiple bases, including the “As is Where is” clause in the
    Asset Purchase Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>SusGlobal brought an application for permission
    to sue BDO under the leave to sue provision in para. 8 of the receivership
    order. On May 17, 2018, McEwen J. dismissed the application, finding that SusGlobal’s
    allegations were not supported by evidence disclosing a <em>prima facie</em> case. On November 8, 2018, McEwen J. refused SusGlobal’s request to reopen the application
    to allow SusGlobal to file fresh evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>SusGlobal filed appeals from both decisions. Its
    notices of appeal were timely if the<i> CJA</i>, under which there is a 30-day
    time limit for commencing an appeal, governed the appeal route. They were late
    if the <i>BIA</i>, which imposes a 10-day time limit, governed. The notices of
    appeal alleged various errors in McEwen J.’s decisions. They also asserted that
    SusGlobal could appeal the decisions as of right to this court under s. 6(1)(b)
    of the <i>CJA</i>, because they were final orders of a judge of the Superior
    Court. In the alternative, if the <i>BIA</i> governed the appeal route, SusGlobal
    asked for an extension of time to comply with the time limits in the<i> BIA</i> and to appeal, or be granted leave to appeal, under it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The narrow issue before us does not require a
    review of whether the grounds of appeal SusGlobal wants to raise have merit.
    All that is in issue on this review motion is the proper appeal route. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>declaring that the appeal from the application judge’s decision
    denying SusGlobal leave to introduce fresh evidence is governed by s. 193(c) of

    leave to appeal is not required; or</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The chambers judge dismissed the motions. He
    held that the <i>BIA</i> was the governing authority for the appeal, not the <i>CJA</i>;
    the root authority under which BDO was appointed was s. 243(1) of the <i>BIA</i>;
    appeals from decisions or orders made in proceedings instituted under the <i>BIA</i> are governed by the <i>BIA</i>, not the <i>CJA</i>; and the reference in the
    receivership order to the <i>CJA</i> did not have the effect of ousting the <i>BIA</i> as the source of appellate authority, nor could it as a matter of federal
    paramountcy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The chambers judge went on to hold that SusGlobal’s
    appeals did not fit within any of the grounds in the <em>BIA</em> that permit
    appeals to this court as of right, including s. 193(c) of the <em>BIA</em>, cited
    by SusGlobal. Nor was the chambers judge prepared to exercise his discretion to
    grant leave to appeal under s. 193(e) of the <em>BIA</em>. Accordingly, he held
    that in a case where there was no right to appeal under the <em>BIA</em> and
    where granting leave to appeal under the <em>BIA</em> was not warranted, no
    extension of time to appeal or seek leave was warranted. He also held that
    there was no reviewable error in the application judge’s discretionary decision
    not to admit SusGlobal’s proposed fresh evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>SusGlobal does not challenge the conclusions of
    the chambers judge referred to in para. 15 above. Instead, it argues that those
    conclusions are derivative of his conclusion about which statute governs the
    appeal route. SusGlobal argues that the <em>CJA</em> governs the appeal route.
    It follows, according to SusGlobal, that it did not require leave to appeal or
    an extension of time, because its appeal was as of right under the <i>CJA </i>and
    was filed in time<i>.</i></span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>SusGlobal does not contest that the receivership
    order was properly made and the receiver properly appointed, including under
    the <i>BIA</i>. It argues that power exists under both the <em>BIA</em> and the <em>CJA</em> to appoint a receiver, and both were explicitly referred to in,
    and formed the basis for, the receivership order. What is in issue, it argues,
    is the source of the authority for the leave to sue provision in the
    receivership order. SusGlobal argues that, since the Supreme Court of Canada
    held in <em>Saskatchewan (Attorney General) v. Lemare Lake Logging Ltd.</em>,
    2015 SCC 53, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 419, at paras. 68 and 73, that provincial laws
    governing receivers were not rendered inoperative by s. 243 of the <em>BIA</em>,
    a receivership order may properly contain provisions authorized only by provincial
    law, in addition to provisions authorized by the <em>BIA</em>. As long as there
    is no operational conflict between the provincial and federal law and the
    provincial law does not frustrate the federal law’s purpose, the provincial law
    will continue to apply alongside the federal law (here, s. 243): <em>Lemare
    Lake</em>, at paras. 15-17. The source of authority for a provision in the receivership
    order determines the proper appeal route from a disposition made under that

    to include the leave to sue provision in the receivership order is not found in
    the <em>BIA</em>. The <em>BIA</em> extends that kind of protection in s.&nbsp;215,
    but the scope of the protection does not include the type of receiver appointed
    here. Rather it refers to, among other persons, interim receivers who may be
    appointed under other provisions of the <em>BIA</em>, such as ss. 46(1) and
    (2). The <em>BIA</em> extends other protections to receivers in s. 251, which
    are not applicable here. SusGlobal’s position is that the sole source of the
    authority for including the leave provision in the receivership order must
    therefore be provincial law flowing from s. 101 of the <em>CJA</em><em><span

lang=EN-US> of the receivership order that was made under the <em>CJA</em>,
    even if other aspects of the receivership order were authorized by the <em>BIA</em>.

    and arising out of the receivership order are <em>BIA</em> proceedings; the
    reference in the receivership order to the<i> <em>CJA</em></i> was unnecessary.
    The <em>BIA</em> and not the <em>CJA</em> appeal provisions should apply to any
    appeal in such proceedings: <em>Canada (Superintendent of Bankruptcy) v. 407

    of the order to determine its source. The appeal provisions of the <em>BIA</em> and <em>CJA</em> are in operational conflict and therefore the <em>BIA</em> provisions prevail under the doctrine of paramountcy. If the appeal provisions
    do not conflict, it is because it is possible to comply with both schemes. The
    only way to comply with both schemes is to follow the more restrictive

    a receiver to “take any other action that the court considers advisable.” Alternatively,
    it is found in s. 215, which includes receivers within the category of

    aspect of the modern approach: <em>Belwood Lake</em>, at para. 42. The court
    must read statutory provisions in their entire context. This involves

    the fact that s. 243(1) of the<i> BIA</i> lacks express words to the effect that
    a court may include a leave to sue provision when appointing a receiver is the
    beginning, not the end of the analysis. A proper understanding of the section’s

    to appoint a receiver and at the same time excluded the power to do so with
    provisions considered to be essential to the court’s role in a receivership. Further,
    Parliament legislated that a receiver should be appointed when just or convenient,
    using language also found, for example, in the <i>CJA</i>. The terms essential
    to a receiver’s appointment and to the court’s role in a receivership inevitably
    inform a court’s assessment of whether it may be just or convenient to appoint a
    receiver. It is therefore also unlikely that Parliament intended the court to
    appoint a receiver when just or convenient while depriving the court of the
    power to include an essential term in the appointment. A leave to sue provision

    provision was to eliminate the need for a patchwork of receivers appointed
    under provincial legislation, it follows that the court’s power to appoint a
    national receiver under s. 243(1) of the <em>BIA</em> comprehends the power to
    include essential receivership terms. At the time that the two bills
    establishing and amending s. 243 received royal assent (Bill C-55 in 2005 and
    Bill C-12 in 2007), the court’s power to include a leave to sue provision in a
    receivership order was firmly entrenched – leave to sue provisions were
    ubiquitous and were considered essential.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

    run counter to the purpose of s. 243(1). On SusGlobal’s argument, since a leave
    to sue provision can only be grounded in provincial authority, and since each
    province’s authority does not normally extend beyond that province, a national
    receiver appointed under the <i>BIA </i>would have to seek a leave to sue
    provision from a court in each province. This is exactly the patchwork scenario
    that s. 243(1) was enacted to avoid.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In my view, the power to include a leave to sue provision in a

    appoint a receiver in s.&nbsp;243(1). In <em>ATCO Gas &amp; Pipelines Ltd. v.
    Alberta (Energy &amp; Utilities Board)</em>, 2006 SCC 4, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 140, at
    para. 51, Bastarache J. set out the rationale for the doctrine of “jurisdiction
    by necessary implication”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The mandate of this Court is to determine and apply the&nbsp;intention
    of the legislature without crossing the line between judicial interpretation
    and legislative drafting. That being said,&nbsp;this rule allows for the
    application of the “doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication”; <span
class=Underline>the powers conferred by an enabling statute are construed to
    include not only those expressly granted but also, by implication, all powers
    which are practically necessary for the accomplishment of the object intended
    to be secured by the statutory regime created by the legislature</span>.

    the <em>BIA</em><i>, </i>to appoint a receiver as a court officer authorized to
    take a broad range of actions when just or convenient to do so, Parliament must
    be taken to have clothed the court with the power to make orders that are essential

    empowered to do. The breadth of that is informed, in part, by what courts
    considered an interim receiver could be empowered to do under the former s.
    47(2) of the <em>BIA</em>. As Moir J. noted in <em>Railside Developments Ltd. (Re)</em>,
    2010 NSSC 13, 62 C.B.R. (5th) 193, at para. 66, Parliament used, in s. 243(1),
    the general words of the former s. 47(2) that had applied to interim receivers.
    Prior to its amendment, s. 47(2) read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(2)&nbsp;The court may direct an interim receiver
    appointed under subsection (1) to do any or all of the following:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a)&nbsp;take possession&nbsp;of all or part of the

    that the section was not open-ended, at para. 45:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>These statutory parameters, though sufficiently
    flexible to authorize a wide range of conduct dealing with the taking,
    management, and eventual disposition of the debtor's property, are not
    open-ended. The powers given to the bankruptcy court under s. 47(2) are powers
    to direct the interim receiver’s conduct. That section does not, explicitly or
    implicitly, confer authority on the bankruptcy court to make unilateral
    declarations about the rights of third parties affected by other statutory
    schemes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    as sufficiently flexible to authorize a wide range of conduct dealing with the
    taking, management, and eventual disposition of the debtor’s property is
    consistent with the court having the power to include a leave to sue provision in
    a receivership order. A receiver directed by the court to take possession and
    control of property and to sell it, for example, may be subject to claims by
    those with whom the court has directed or authorized the receiver to deal. This
    is a central reason for the leave to sue provision’s necessity. </span></p>

    unilateral declarations about the rights of third parties affected by other

    as the Superintendent or an official receiver, are not appointed by court order
    (although some, such as official receivers, are deemed to be officers of the
    court): see ss. 5(1), 12(2). Trustees in bankruptcy can be empowered without a
    court order: see s.14. Even interim receivers, who are court-appointed, fill a
    role that is a creature of the <em>BIA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> with specific statutory limits on their activities and powers: see for example

    is those types of receivers who, when appointed under other statutes, were
    historically clothed with customary and common terms essential to their
    appointment, such as that found in the receivership order’s leave to sue
    provision. The <em>BIA</em> power of appointment carries with it the power to
    impose that type of term. It would be anomalous to read s. 215 as providing for
    the protection of the officials specified in it, while also <u>prohibiting</u> the court from including, in a s. 243(1) <em>BIA</em> appointment, a term
    essential to the very receivership s. 243(1) contemplates.</span></p>

    Both <em>Crate Marine</em> and <em>Romspen</em>, however, did not deal with any
    argument that s. 215, due to its wording, should be taken not to apply to
    receivers appointed under s. 243(1). They did not address the arguments
    SusGlobal or BDO make here about that wording and therefore did not decide the
    issue. Given my conclusion that s. 243(1) authorizes the inclusion of leave to
    sue provisions in receivership orders, it is unnecessary to further deal with the
    s. 215 point here. The leave to sue provision can stand as authorized by the <i>BIA </i>without resort to s. 215. It is certainly not prohibited by s. 215.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote>The courts have recognized that, given the broad and loosely
