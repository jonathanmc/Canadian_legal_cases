  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was convicted of various offences arising out of
    the alleged sexual assault of S., his nine-year old daughter. S. testified and
    described various forms of sexual abuse that occurred over about a 10-month
    period. Her younger stepsister, A., also testified. She confirmed parts of S.’s
    evidence about the sexual abuse, but in some ways her evidence was quite
    different than S.’s evidence. The appellant testified and denied any sexual
    misconduct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the course of the defence, it put forward the position that S.
    had a motive to fabricate the allegations against the appellant and that A. <span
lang=EN-US>had gone along with S.’s fabrication as a way of offering some
    explanation for how she came to be in possession of the vibrator that was found
    in her computer bag. The trial judge ultimately rejected the defence position
    and gave reasons for doing so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge clearly appreciated the
    substance of the evidence and the respective positions of the parties. She
    articulated those positions in her reasons. The trial judge also instructed
    herself on key legal principles, including the burden of proof and the manner
    in which the evidence of children should be assessed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge considered and rejected the
    appellant’s evidence. She gave two reasons for doing so. We need not go into
    any details with respect to those reasons as the appellant’s arguments focus on
    the trial judge’s acceptance of S.’s evidence and not her rejection of the
    appellant’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was alive to the contradictions
    and inconsistencies in S.’s evidence. She not only summarized those inconsistencies
    and contradictions, but referred to some of them in the context of her
    assessment of S.’s credibility. The trial judge also referred to various
    factors in S.’s demeanour and in the presentation of her evidence, which in the
    trial judge’s view enhanced her credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Next, the trial judge contrasted S.’s evidence
    with A.’s testimony. She found S. credible and A. much less credible. This part
    of the trial judge’s reasons is significant for the purposes of appeal, in that
    it demonstrates that the trial judge appreciated the individualized nature of
    the credibility assessments she was obligated to make. The trial judge clearly
    made no inappropriate assumptions about the evidence of children or how
    children should behave when testifying. Rather, the trial judge made
    credibility findings after a critical analysis of the evidence of each witness. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the end, the trial judge was clearly aware of
    the features in S.’s testimony that could undermine her credibility and
    reliability. The trial judge also identified factors which, in her view,
    supported the credibility and reliability of the evidence. These factors
    considered, as a whole, ultimately led her to conclude, first, that S. was a
    credible witness whose evidence could be believed and, second, that her evidence
    established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On a review of the reasons of the trial judge in
    the context of the entire record, it is clear how she arrived at her verdicts.
    She got there by first rejecting totally the material defence evidence as
    untruthful and secondly by a reasoned acceptance of the core of S.’s evidence
    as it related to the allegations of sexual misconduct. The trial judge then
    placed that acceptance of S.’s evidence in the context of the Crown’s burden of
    proof and found that the case had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons set out above, we are satisfied
    that the trial judge’s reasons did admit of appellate review and were adequate.
    We also find no error in the trial judge’s analysis of the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also submitted that the verdicts
    were unreasonable. We cannot agree with that submission. S.’s evidence, if
    believed, and it was certainly reasonably capable of belief, provided ample
    evidence to support the verdicts arrived at by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The conviction appeal is dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Turning to the sentence appeal, the trial judge
    imposed a total sentence of three and one-half years. The appellant argues that
    the sentence should be reduced because the trial judge gave inadequate
    consideration to the appellant’s Aboriginal background. We disagree. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The reasons for sentence demonstrate that the
    trial judge gave proper consideration to this factor. The trial judge made
    numerous references to the </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> Report that
    had been prepared for the purposes of sentencing. For example, she referenced
    the report at pp. 3 to 6 of her reasons for sentence. The trial judge also
    quoted from the relevant Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, e.g. see </span><em>R.
    v. Wells</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are satisfied that the trial judge did give
    meaningful consideration to the appellant’s Aboriginal background. When
    considered with all of the other relevant factors in this case, which include
    the age of the victim, the seriousness of the abuse, and the egregious breach
