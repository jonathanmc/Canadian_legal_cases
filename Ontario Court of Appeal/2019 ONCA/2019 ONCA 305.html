  <p class=Judge><strong>Pardu J.A.:</strong></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following summary judgment motions that were heard
    over four days, the motion judge dismissed the appellants’ proposed class
    action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants are an individual beer consumer
    and the licensed restaurant he operates. In their action, the appellants took issue
    firstly with a “Framework Agreement” between the respondents, the Liquor
    Control Board of Ontario (“LCBO”, the “Board”) and Brewers Retail Inc., signed
    on June 1, 2000, which they allege violated s. 45(1) of the </span><em>Competition
    Act</em>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-34,<span lang=EN-US> and secondly with a surcharge
    that Brewers Retail Inc. levied on licensees (essentially, persons such as
    restaurants and pubs licensed under the </span><em>Liquor Licence Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>, R.S.O 1990, c. L. 19 to sell beer), which they allege violated the </span>the <em>Liquor Control Act</em>,<em> </em>R.S.O. 1990, c. L.18. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants’ claim arising out of the
    Framework Agreement requires a consideration of what is known as the “regulated
    conduct defence” as it applies to a provincially regulated defendant. </span>Broadly
    speaking, in that context, the defence insulates the defendant from criminal
    liability if the legislation governing the regulated defendant (in this case,
    the <em>Liquor Control Act</em>) is constitutionally valid, it directs or
    authorizes the defendant to engage in the impugned conduct, and the law
    providing for criminal liability (in this case, the <em>Competition Act</em>)
    leaves room for the regulated activity to operate without being criminalized. <span
lang=EN-US>As the motion judge explained, the regulated conduct defence is
    fundamentally a principle of statutory interpretation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary, the appellants advanced four claims: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>T</span>he respondents conspired to divide the beer market between
    them. The conspiracy is embodied in the Framework Agreement and continues to
    this day. This conduct violated s. 45(1) of the <em>Competition Act</em>, both
    as in effect in June 2000, and as amended effective March 2010, and entitled
    the appellants to sue for damages under s. 36(1) of the <em>Competition Act</em>.
    The appellants also pled the civil tort of conspiracy, relying on the same
    violation of the <em>Competition Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Brewers Retail
    Inc. charged licensees five percent more for beer than it charged consumers, in
    violation of the <em>Liquor Control Act</em>, which requires uniform prices for
    beer throughout Ontario, and the beer respondents <i>(</i><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Labatt Breweries of Canada LP, Labatt Brewing Company
    Limited, Molson Coors Canada Inc. and Molson Canada 2005</span></em>, which in
    the aggregate owned 90% of Brewers Retail Inc. at the relevant time<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>)
    were unjustly enriched by this surcharge.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The LCBO’s
    conduct in entering into the Framework Agreement amounted to the novel tort of misconduct
    by a civil authority entitling the appellants to damages.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario’s legislative
    efforts to retroactively authorize the Framework Agreement amount to an
    impermissible, <em>ultra vires</em> intrusion upon the federal criminal law and
    trade and commerce powers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents moved for summary judgment, dismissing
    the appellants’ action. The motion judge granted the respondents’ motions and dismissed
    the appellants’ action on the following grounds:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both versions of
    s. 45 of the <em>Competition Act</em> leave leeway for activity regulated under
    the <i>Liquor Control Act</i> to operate without criminal liability: <em>Hughes
    v. Liquor Control Board of Ontario</em>, 2018 ONSC 1723, at paras. 221-30. Accordingly,
    the regulated conduct defence is available if the legislation governing the
    industry in question expressly or by necessary implication directs or
    authorizes the defendant to engage in the impugned conduct: <em>Hughes</em>, at
    para. 220. The alleged violation of the <em>Competition Act</em> was within the
    powers and rights conferred upon the LCBO and Brewers Retail Inc. under the <em>Liquor
    Control Act</em>: <em>Hughes</em>, at para. 240. In any event, s. 10(3) of the <em>Liquor
    Control Act</em>, as amended by the <em>Building Ontario Up Act (Budget
    Measures), 2015</em>, S.O. 2015, c. 20, Sched. 20, s. 8, enacted in August 2015,
    declared expressly with retroactive effect that the LCBO was deemed to have
    been directed and Brewers Retail Inc. was deemed to have been authorized to
    implement the Framework Agreement in 2000: <em>Hughes</em>, at para. 241. Accordingly,
    the regulated conduct defence insulated the respondents from liability for
    damages under the <em>Competition Act</em>: <em>Hughes</em>, at paras. 237-47.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Liquor
    Control Act</em> authorized differential prices for licensees and consumers,
    thus providing a juristic reason for the differential pricing. In any event, s.
    3(1.1) of the <em>Liquor Control Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    as amended by the </span>Building Ontario Up Act (Budget Measures), 2015</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, s. 3(4),</span></em> provided that the powers of
    the LCBO “are deemed always to have included” the power to implement a price
    differential for licensees and consumers, provided that those prices are
    charged uniformly for each of the two distribution channels (i.e. a
    distribution channel for retail consumers and a distribution channel for
    licensees) across the province.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The LCBO
    exercised its statutory authority in compliance with the authority given to it
    by the <em>Liquor Control Act</em> and in a reasonable manner, as a matter of
    administrative law. Therefore, even if the tort of misconduct by a civil
    authority existed in Ontario, the appellants would not have been entitled to
    damages under that tort. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The retroactive
    legislation sanctioning the conduct complained of in the action was a lawful
    exercise of the province’s undoubted ability to regulate the sale of alcoholic
    beverages in the province.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants challenge each of these findings.
    They also seek leave to appeal from the costs award in favour of the
    respondents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would dismiss the appeal and deny leave to
    appeal the costs award for the reasons that follow.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that the regulated conduct
    defence requires identifying legislative authority that </span><span
class=Underline>specifically</span> <span lang=EN-US>permits the impugned
    conduct; in their view, the </span><em>Liquor Control Act</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    as in effect in June 2000, did not specifically authorize the alleged market
    conspiracy. Further, they argue that, even if </span><em>intra vires</em><span
lang=EN-US> of Ontario, retroactive legislation cannot be considered in
    determining the application of the regulated conduct defence. Accordingly, they
    argue, the motion judge erred in dismissing their action based on the Framework
    Agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the motion judge that the </span><em>Liquor

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Below, I first provide some brief historical
    background about the arrangements between the LCBO and Brewers Retail Inc., and
    the Framework Agreement, and then set out the relevant portions of s. 45 of the </span><em>Competition Act</em><span lang=EN-US> (as in effect in June 2000 and
    as amended effective March 2010). I will explain why the motion judge concluded
    that s. 45 provides leeway for the operation of the regulated conduct defence. Next,
    I consider the jurisprudence regarding the nature of the authorization or
    direction required for the regulated conduct defence to apply, set out the
    relevant portions of the </span><em>Liquor Control Act</em><span lang=EN-US> in
    effect in June 2000, and consider those provisions in light of the applicable
    test. Finally, I address the appellants’ argument that retroactive legislation
    cannot be considered in determining the application of the regulated conduct
    defence.</span></p>

    Act</i> </span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As the motion judge observed, the LCBO was
    established by the government of Ontario in 1927 after the repeal of prohibition.
    It is a Crown agency wholly owned by Ontario and is required to abide by policy
    decisions and directives of the government. The government has exercised tight
    control over the sale of alcoholic beverages. At the same time as the LCBO was
    established, the Ontario government, in consultation with the brewing industry,
    set up a single distribution system for beer manufactured in Ontario, through
    what is now Brewers Retail Inc., which was authorized to operate government
    stores for the sale of beer under the </span><em>Liquor Control Act</em><span
lang=EN-US>. The LCBO stores, in contrast, focused on wine and spirits. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was common ground that prior to the Framework
    Agreement, the LCBO operated two types of stores: (i) “Ordinary Stores”, which
    operated in communities where Brewers Retail Inc. operated outlets and; (2)
    “Combination Stores”, which operated in smaller communities where Brewers
    Retail Inc. did not operate outlets. The Framework Agreement provided that, in
    its Ordinary Stores, the LCBO would not sell beer in packages greater than six
    containers and that the LCBO would not sell any beer product that was exclusively
    sold by Brewers Retail Inc. Even before the Framework Agreement was signed,
    government policy did not generally allow LCBO Ordinary Stores to sell beer in
    packages greater than six packs, and gave Brewers Retail Inc. the right to sell
    beer in 12-pack and 24-pack formats. Both before and after the Framework Agreement,
    the LCBO could not sell beer to licensees that was available for purchase at
    Brewers Retail Inc. The motion judge concluded, at para. 283, that the
    Framework Agreement did not materially change anything, but rather “essentially
    continued market practices that had existed for decades.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants allege that the formalization of
    this arrangement, in the Framework Agreement, violated s. 45(1) of the </span><em>Competition
    Act</em><span lang=EN-US> as in effect in June 2000, and as subsequently
    amended effective March 2010. In June 2000, the following version of s. 45(1)  was

lang=EN-US> 2012 ONSC 2752. At para. 58, the court indicated, “[i]n order for

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, </span><em>Fournier</em><span
lang=EN-US> does not articulate a more restrictive test than </span><em>Jabour</em><span
lang=EN-US>. Rather, it clarifies that the “authority” required can be express
    or can be found in a statute by “necessary implication”. That authority may be
    articulated in general terms, as in </span><em>Jabour</em><span lang=EN-US>, or
    in very specific terms, as in the present case, provided that that authority is
    expressed or given by necessary implication. The level of specificity that the
    appellants argue </span><em>Fournier</em> <span lang=EN-US>suggests is needed is
    more restrictive than the test described in </span><em>Jabour</em><span
lang=EN-US>, which, as I have said, is the controlling authority. </span><em>Jabour </em><span lang=EN-US>did not require the same level of specificity that the appellants
    suggest is needed to invoke the regulated conduct defence. In </span><em>Jabour</em><span
lang=EN-US>, the Supreme Court rejected the argument of the Attorney General of
    Canada that the absence of a specific statutory provision authorizing the Law
    Society to regulate advertising by lawyers deprived the Law Society of the
    regulated conduct defence; further, the court did not agree with the conclusion
    of the trial judge that the absence of a specific implicit authorization in the </span><em>Legal Professions Act </em><span lang=EN-US>meant that there was no
    scope for the application of the regulated conduct defence: </span><em>Jabour</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at pp. 331, 341, 354. In </span><em>Jabour</em><span lang=EN-US> the legislation in issue gave Benchers the </span><span class=Underline>express</span><span
lang=EN-US> power to determine what amounted to conduct unbecoming a member of
    the Law Society, that is to say “any matter, conduct, or thing that is deemed
    in the judgment of the Benchers to be contrary to the best interest of the
    public or of the legal profession, or that tends to harm the standing of the
    legal profession”:</span><em> Legal Professions Act, </em><span lang=EN-US>s. 1.

    advertising by lawyers. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do note that </span><em>Jabour</em><span
lang=EN-US> considered whether the conduct of a regulator was authorized.
    Arguably, more specific authority might be required to provide immunity where
    only the conduct of a “regulatee” (a person regulated by the regulator) and not
    also the regulator is at issue. But that is an issue for another day. Here, the
    impugned conduct involves an arrangement between the regulator, the LCBO, and a
    regulatee, Brewers Retail Inc. </span></p>

lang=EN-US> to argue that the direction or authorization must be specific, they
    take issue with </span><em>Fournier</em><span lang=EN-US>’s holding, adopted by
    the motion judge, that the direction or authorization may be by necessary
    implication, and need not be express. I agree with the motion judge that the
    direction or authorization may be by necessary implication. The purpose of the
    regulated conduct defence and the leeway granted under the </span><em>Competition
    Act </em><span lang=EN-US>is to allow room for implementation of provincial
    public policy expressed in legislative form. Both an express grant of authority
    and a grant of authority by necessary implication advance those provincial legislative
    interests and I see no reason to distinguish between them for the purposes of
    the regulated conduct defence. It is not a difference of substance from an
    express grant of authority where, as a matter of statutory interpretation, it
    must necessarily be implied that the legislature gave a regulatory body
    authority to engage in the impugned conduct in order to advance legislative
    goals.</span></p>

    prohibited by the </span><em>Competition Act</em><span lang=EN-US> be
    specifically authorized by the regulatory legislation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept this argument. Section 45(7) of
    the </span><em>Competition Act </em><span lang=EN-US>provides that the rules
    and principles of common law that render a requirement or authorization by or
    under an Act of a provincial legislature a defence to a prosecution under the
    Act continue in force. </span><em>Jabour</em><span lang=EN-US> was decided
    before s. 45(7) was enacted. As I have indicated earlier, </span><em>Jabour</em><span
lang=EN-US> demonstrates that a general authority such as that given to a law
    society to regulate the conduct of its members may enable the regulated conduct
    defence to operate. There is nothing in the language of s. 45(7) that suggests
    a legislative intention to change the common law interpretation of “authority”,
    rather, the expressed intention is to preserve the common law. As indicated in</span><em> Jabour</em><span lang=EN-US>, at p. 354 culpability under the federal
    legislation can be “negated by the authority extended by a valid provincial
    regulatory statute”. There is no basis to conclude that s. 45(7) was intended
    to narrow the scope of the meaning of “authority” or “authorization”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>This legislative expression of the regulated conduct defence earlier

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Régie des rentes du Québec, </em>the court described the operation of
    retroactive legislation, at paras. 26-28:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[26] It is settled law in Canada that it is within the
    prerogative of the legislature to enter the domain of the courts and offer a
    binding interpretation of its own law by enacting declaratory legislation: L.-P.
    Pigeon, <em>Drafting and Interpreting Legislation</em> (1988), at pp. 81-82. As
    this Court acknowledged in <em>Western Minerals Ltd. v. Gaumont</em>, <span
lang=EN-US>[1953] 1 S.C.R. 345, such forays are usually made where the
    legislature wishes to correct judicial interpretations that it perceives to be
    erroneous. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[27] In enacting declaratory legislation, the legislature
    assumes the role of a court and dictates the interpretation of its own law:
    P.-A. Côté, in collaboration with S. Beaulac and M. Devinat, <em>The
    Interpretation of Legislation in Canada</em> (4th ed. 2011), at p. 562. As a
    result<span lang=EN-US>, declaratory provisions operate less as legislation and
    more as jurisprudence. They are akin to binding precedents, such as the
    decision of a court: P. Roubier, </span><em>Le droit transitoire: conflits des
    lois dans le temps</em><span lang=EN-US> (2nd ed. 1993), at p. 248. </span>Such
    legislation may overrule a court decision in the same way that a decision of
    this Court would take precedence over a previous line of lower court judgments
    on a given question of law.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[28] It is also </span>settled<span
lang=EN-US> law that declaratory provisions have an immediate effect on pending
    cases, and are therefore an exception to the general rule that legislation is
    prospective. The interpretation imposed by a declaratory provision </span>stretches
    back in time to the date when the legislation it purports to interpret first
    came into force, with the effect that the legislation in question is deemed to
    have always included this provision. Thus, the interpretation so declared is
    taken to have always been the law: R. Sullivan, <em>Sullivan on the
    Construction of Statutes</em> (5th ed. 2008), at pp. 682-83. [Citations in
    original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the respondents should not be able to take advantage of
    the regulated conduct defence when the conduct in issue is retroactively
    sanctioned. I do not agree. The purpose of extending that defence in the
    context of the <em>Competition Act</em> is to avoid criminalizing conduct that
    a province deems to be in the public interest. That same provincial public
    interest should be recognized whether it is expressed in legislation in force
    at the time of the impugned acts, or expressed in retroactive legislation. Further,
    there is no logical basis to treat Brewers Retail Inc. differently from the
    LCBO with respect to the market allocation agreement. They are opposite sides
    of the same transaction which benefits from the regulated conduct defence.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> The price
    differential for beer sales to consumers and licensees</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated above, the appellants allege that the five percent surcharge
    Brewers Retail Inc. levied on licensees, as compared to consumers, violated the <em>Liquor Control Act</em>, as it appeared on June 2000. They claim that the beer
    respondents, which owned 90% of Brewers Retail Inc. at the time, were unjustly enriched
    by the collection of this surcharge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span
lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that the motion judge erred in his
    interpretation of the </span><em>Liquor Control Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, as
    it appeared on June 2000, and that, correctly interpreted, the surcharge
    violated that Act. Further, they argue that, even if constitutional,
    retroactive legislation cannot be considered when determining whether there was
    a juristic reason for a defendant’s enrichment. In their view, only legislation
    in effect at the time of the enrichment can provide a juristic reason. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant statutory provision of the <em>Liquor Control Act</em> reads as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><em>Power and purposes of Board</em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>3.(1)&nbsp;The purposes of the Board are, and it
    has power, </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>(i) to fix the
    prices at which the various classes, varieties and brands of liquor are to be
    sold and, except in the case of liquor sold through an outlet designated by the
    Minister of National Revenue under the </span><em><a
href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-e-14/latest/rsc-1985-c-e-14.html"><span

lang=EN> as a duty free sales outlet,</span><span class=Underline> such prices
    shall be the same at all government stores.</span> <span lang=EN>[Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ argument is that the plain meaning of this provision requires that
    the same price be charged to all beer purchasers and that differential prices
    to licensees are not permitted. The respondents’ argument is that this
    provision was intended to require that no differential price be imposed
    according to the geographic location of the buyer and to eliminate higher costs
    for beer in Northern Ontario. In the respondents’ view, this provision does not
    prohibit differential pricing among classes, varieties and brands as long as
    the price for each is the same at all government stores (subject to the
    exception). Accordingly, just as the price for six packs of beer and 12-packs,
    for example, can diverge so long as the price for each is the same at all
    government stores, so can the price of liquor (which includes beer) intended
    for sale to each channel of consumer and licensee purchasers diverge. The respondents
    argue that this interpretation is consistent with decades of LCBO and Brewers
    Retail Inc. practice. They therefore submit that s. 3(1)(i) permits the LCBO to
    differentiate as to price between consumers and licensees.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge favoured the interpretation advanced by the respondents, and, at
    paras. 257-59, of his reasons stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[257] The approach to interpretation is
    teleological or purposeful and to interpret a statute, the words of the statute
    are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the statute, the object of the statute,
    and the intention of the legislator.</span><a name="_ftnref68"></a><a

lang=EN> </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[<a name=par258>258</a>] </span>Following this
    purposefully approach to interpretation, I favour the interpretation advanced
    by the Defendants. Their interpretation is supported by: (a) the legislative
    history; (b) a proper contextual and purposeful reading of s. 3(1)(i); and (c)
    how the section has been interpreted and applied for decades by the parties
    subject to it, including the LCBO which is the regulator under the legislative
    scheme.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[<a name=par259>259</a>]  When
    interpreting a specialized public law statute, the public statements of the
    regulator about the scope of its home statute<span lang=EN> and the
    administrative practice and interpretation adopted by the regulator, while not
    determinative, are important factors to be weighed in interpreting the statute.

    indicated above, in relation to retroactive authorization of beer market

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span

    reject the appellants’ argument that juristic reason cannot be provided by
    retroactive legislation. This deeming provision supplies the juristic reason
    for the enrichment and puts an end to the appellants’ action for damages for
    unjust enrichment: <em>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co</em>., at para. 49. There
    is no doubt that retroactive legislation can defeat financial expectations
    based on the law in place before the retroactive amendment.</p>

    authority</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span

    appellants rely on <em>Paradis Honey Ltd. v. Canada (Ministry of Agriculture
    and Agri-Food),</em> 2015 FCA 89, [2016] 1 F.C.R. 446, leave to appeal refused,
    [2015] S.C.C.A. No. 227, at paras. 132-40, in which Stratas J.A. proposed that
    in claims for damages for misconduct by a civil authority, courts could grant
    relief where the civil authority acted unacceptably or indefensibly according
    to public law principles, and where the court decided in its discretion that an
    award of damages was appropriate. Even if this basis for liability were adopted
    in Ontario, relief would be unavailable to the appellants here because of the
    conclusions already expressed. The Framework Agreement allocating the beer
    market was authorized by statute, both the current and retroactive versions. The
    price differential was also authorized, at least by retroactive legislation. The
    conduct of the LCBO was reasonable in the public law sense, and there is no
    basis to say that it acted unacceptably or indefensibly. Indeed, the appellants
    acknowledge that if they are unsuccessful on their arguments regarding the
    allocation of beer sales under the Framework Agreement and the differential
    pricing, this ground of appeal cannot succeed. </p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> Is the retroactive

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that s. 10(3) of the <em>Liquor Control Act</em> is outside
    the legislative competence of the government of Ontario, and that it amounts to
    an impermissible intrusion into the trade and commerce and criminal law powers
    exclusively reserved to the federal government. Further, the appellants submit
    in their factum that Ontario cannot dabble in legislation that has the express
    purpose of altering the competitive landscape of industry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    ease of reference, I repeat, s. 10(3) of the <em>Liquor Control Act</em>, which
    reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The Board is deemed
    to have been directed, and Brewers Retail Inc. is deemed to have been
    authorized, to enter into the June 2000 framework in relation to the Crown’s or
    a Crown agent’s regulation and control of the sale of beer in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first step in a division of powers analysis is to determine the “pith and
    substance” or the “true character of the law”: <em>Canada Post Corporation v.
    Hamilton (City)</em>, 2016 ONCA 767, 134 O.R. (3d) 502, at para. 32. Here, the
    essence of both the overall regulatory regime embodied in the <em>Liquor Control
    Act </em>and s. 10(3) itself is the regulation and control of the sale of
    liquor in the province. I agree with the motion judge that this matter is
    unquestionably within a province’s jurisdiction under the <em>Constitution Act</em>, <em>1867</em>, s. 92(13), property and civil rights, and s. 92(16), matters of
    a local or private nature. As observed in <em>General Motors of Canada Ltd. v.
    City National</em> <em>Leasing</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 641, at p. 682: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>[C]ompetition is not a single
    matter, any more than inflation or pollution. The provinces too, may deal with
    competition in the exercise of their legislative powers in such fields as
    consumer protection, labour relations, marketing and the like. The point is,
    however, that Parliament also has the constitutional power to regulate
    intraprovincial aspects of competition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    there is no conflict between valid provincial legislation and the federal <em>Competition
    Act</em>, as the federal legislation accords leeway to provinces to implement
    legislation to advance their public interest, without running afoul of s. 45 of
    the <em>Competition Act</em>. That in essence, is the regulated conduct defence.
    Whether the provincial legislation is retroactive or not is beside the point in
    a non-criminal context. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>I agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that s. 10(3) is
    constitutionally valid legislation, enacted within the matters allocated to a
    province by s. 92 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867.</em></p>
  <h2>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span> Leave to appeal

    Law Foundation of Ontario and the appellants seek leave to appeal and allege
    that the motion judge made many errors in his assessment of costs. They submit
    that he failed to consider the impact upon access to justice of a cost order of
    this magnitude. Further, they submit that under an analysis of s. 31(1) of the <em>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c. 6, the motion judge erred in his
    assessment of the complexity of the case, the extent to which the case raised a
    matter of public interest, the degree of novelty of the issues raised and erred
    in his assessment of what amount constituted a fair and reasonable costs award. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has held that leave to appeal costs awards should be granted sparingly
    and only in “obvious cases where the party seeking leave convinces the court
    there are ‘strong grounds upon which the appellate court could find that the
    judge erred in exercising his discretion’”: <em>Brad-Jay Investments Ltd. v.

    S.C.C.A. No. 92, at para. 21. Here, the motion judge largely considered all the
    arguments made by the appellants; he did not fail to consider a relevant factor.

    court discussed the need for “leeway” language in a federal criminal statute to
    create room for a “valid <u>provincial</u> regulatory scheme” to operate,
    giving rise to a regulated conduct defence: at para. 77 (emphasis added). There
    is some suggestion by scholars, practitioners and the Competition Bureau that
    the exercise in statutory interpretation giving rise to the defence may be
    different when it is raised by a conflicting federal regulatory scheme: Robert
    Mysicka, “The Regulated Conduct Doctrine” (2011) 24:1 Can. Competition L. Rev.
