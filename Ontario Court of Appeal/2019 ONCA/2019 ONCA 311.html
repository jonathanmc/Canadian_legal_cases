  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></b></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Attorney General of Ontario and police
    officers Jamie Clark, Donald Belanger and Steven Watts have launched three
    separate appeals from two orders addressing a bifurcated motion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These appeals arise out of the officers’ arrest
    of two men, Randy Maharaj and Neil Singh, in connection with an armed robbery
    that occurred in February 2009. Both men alleged that the officers assaulted
    them during the course of their arrests, and these allegations had significant
    consequences: charges against Mr. Maharaj were stayed, and although Mr. Singh
    was prosecuted and convicted, the trial judge’s finding that he was assaulted
    during his arrest led to his conviction being set aside and a stay being
    entered by this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police officers sued the Attorney General,
    alleging that the Crown attorneys prosecuting Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh were
    negligent and misfeasant because they failed to adequately investigate the
    assault allegations and failed to call evidence – in particular, testimony from
    the officers – to refute the allegations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 20, 2015, the officers served notice
    on the Attorney General, under ss. 7(1) and 10 of the </span><em>Proceedings
    Against the Crown Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 27, of their
    intention to commence an action. They commenced their action on June 22, 2016,
    asserting claims against the Attorney General in negligence and misfeasance in
    public office. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the statement of claim the police officers allege that they have
    suffered irreparable harm including “significant depression, emotional trauma
    and loss of enjoyment of life,” and “irreparable damage to their reputations
    and credibility among members of the judiciary, the Attorney General’s Office,
    the criminal defence bar and the public at large.” In particular, the findings
    of fact made by judges of the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal that the
    officers “assaulted and tortured accused in their custody is brought forward
    many times when they are required to testify in court.” The consequence for the
    officers is that “they have been subject to ridicule and contempt and will face
    this prejudice for the rest of their career.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Attorney General moved under </span>r.
    21.01(1)(a) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, <span
lang=EN-US>to strike the action on the grounds that it is barred by the expiry
    of the limitation period in the </span><em>Limitations Act</em><i><span
lang=EN-US>, </span></i>2002, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B<span lang=EN-US>,<i> </i>and
    under r. 21.01(1)(b) because it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The Attorney
    General also moved under rr. 21.01(3)(d) and 25.11 to strike the claims as
    scandalous and/or vexatious, on the basis that the officers’ statement of claim
    did not contain full particulars and pleaded bald allegations of malice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge dismissed the motion to strike
    based on the limitations issue, struck the negligence claim as disclosing no
    reasonable cause of action, and allowed the misfeasance claim to proceed. He
    made no order regarding rr. 21.01(3)(d) or 25.11. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The officers appeal the negligence ruling, and
    the Attorney General appeals the limitations and the misfeasance rulings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These appeals raise three issues:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>(1) Is the
    action time barred?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>(2) Does
    the action lie against the Crown for negligence?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>(3) Does
    the action lie against the Crown for misfeasance in public office?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We address each issue after setting out the
    factual background. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, we conclude that
    the motion judge did not err in dismissing the motion to strike the action as
    time barred, in striking the negligence claim, and in allowing the officers’ misfeasance
    claim to proceed. The appeals are dismissed. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Factual Background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We take these facts from the statement of claim.
    They are assumed to be true for the purposes of the </span>r. 21 motion, <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sergeant Jamie Clark, Detective Sergeant Donald
    Belanger, and Detective Sergeant Steven Watts are police officers with the
    Toronto Police Service. On June 11, 2009, they were working with Hold Up Squad
    when they arrested Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh in connection with an armed
    robbery that had occurred at Crane Supply Canada, where Mr. Singh worked, in
    February 2009. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 11, 2009, the officers interviewed Mr.
    Maharaj and Mr. Singh, both of whom provided videotaped statements. Mr. Singh
    provided a false exculpatory statement to Det. Sgt. Watts and Sgt. Clark. Mr.
    Maharaj confessed his and Mr.&nbsp; Singh’s involvement in the crime to Det.
    Sgt. Watts and Det. Sgt. Belanger.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 12, 2009, during the course of the bail
    hearing, counsel for Mr. Maharaj advised the court that Mr. Maharaj had
    suffered injuries during the arrest including visible bumps and scratches under
    his ear. No suggestion was made at that time that he had been assaulted by the
    officers, nor was there any complaint that he had sustained a serious rib
    injury during the arrest or otherwise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On July 16, 2010, the preliminary hearing
    commenced. The videotaped statements were admitted into evidence and their
    voluntariness was not challenged. The officers were called as witnesses and denied
    suggestions from Mr. Maharaj’s counsel that Mr. Maharaj had been assaulted
    during his arrest – specifically that he had been kicked on the side of the
    head and beaten by Sgt. Clark and Det. Sgt. Belanger. Mr. Maharaj and Mr. Singh
    were committed to stand trial.</span></p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong><span lang=EN-US>The charges against Mr. Maharaj are
    stayed</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the committal, Crown Attorney Sheila
    Cressman was assigned carriage of the prosecution. On the eve of the trial, Mr.
    Maharaj brought an application to stay the proceedings against him and to exclude
    his confession on the ground that the police had beaten him and caused him to
    suffer a serious rib injury. His counsel provided Ms. Cressman with X-rays of
    his ribs to support his claim as well as a transcript from the bail hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Cressman consulted with Dr. Farley Moss, a
    doctor at the hospital where the X-rays were taken. Dr. Moss confirmed that Mr.
    Maharaj had an acute rib fracture and advised that a person who had sustained
    such an injury would find it excruciatingly painful to make any movements with
    his arms or upper body. Dr. Moss was not asked to review the videotaped
    statement of Mr. Maharaj following his arrest, in which he is seen moving and
    lifting his arms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Cressman received Mr. Maharaj’s medical
    records from Maplehurst Detention Centre, where he was incarcerated pending
    trial. The only injuries noted in the medical records were complaints about
    bruises to his upper arm; there was no indication that Mr. Maharaj ever
    complained about a rib injury, including in the first few days after the
    arrest. Ms. Cressman made no inquiries of Maplehurst staff or any of the
    medical staff who dealt with Mr. Maharaj.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Cressman consulted with a senior Crown
    Attorney, Frank Armstrong, about Mr. Maharaj’s statement. Without any further
    investigation, Mr. Armstrong agreed with Ms. Cressman that Mr. Maharaj’s
    statement would not be admissible as it could not be proven to be voluntary in
    light of the injuries he purportedly sustained during arrest. As a result, on
    November 22, 2011, the charges against Mr. Maharaj were stayed by Mr. Armstrong
    before McMahon J. of the Superior Court.</span></p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Singh’s conviction and appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial against Mr. Singh proceeded on
    November 28, 2011. Counsel for Mr. Singh brought an application to stay the
    proceedings. Mr. Singh testified that Sgt. Clark assaulted him while Det. Sgt.
    Watts stood by. Mr. Maharaj testified that he was assaulted by Det. Sgt.
    Belanger and Sgt. Clark. Ms. Cressman did not call any evidence to challenge
    the assault allegations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The officers expected to testify and would have
    testified in a manner consistent with the evidence they gave at the preliminary
    hearing. Although Ms.&nbsp; Cressman had assured the officers that they would
    be called as witnesses, at the end of the first day of the hearing she advised Det.
    Sgt. Watts that their evidence would not be required. Det. Sgt. Watts expressed
    concern about the impact this decision would have on the officers, but Ms.
    Cressman did not change her position.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A jury convicted Mr. Singh of armed robbery and
    forcible confinement. Justice Thorburn ultimately dismissed his stay

    the failure to appreciate the legal significance of discoverable facts does not
    suspend the running of a limitation period. However, he noted that there is an

lang=EN-US>(2001), 57 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at paras. 21-22, plaintiffs should

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he question
    whether the plaintiffs should have known that a civil remedy was appropriate
    before they obtained legal advice, is a determination that should not be made
    at a preliminary stage such as this. At this stage, and based on the record as
    it currently exists, it is not plain and obvious that the limitation issue will
    be decided against the plaintiffs.</span></p>

    that he was not<i> </i>determining the limitation period issue with finality:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[M]y decision is
    based on the directive of the Court of Appeal that pleadings should be closed

    additional facts could be asserted that would alter the conclusion that a
    limitation period had expired. Save in those exceptional situations, such a
    motion should only be brought after pleadings have been exchanged, whether by
    way of a Rule 21 motion (if appropriate) or a motion for summary judgment.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Attorney General argues that the motion judge
    erred by applying the wrong test on the motion, by finding that there is an
    exception to the general rule of discoverability for “novel” claims, and by
    failing to consider or conduct any analysis regarding the officers’ admission
    that they did not seek legal advice until several months after this court’s
    decision in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Singh</span></em><span lang=EN-US>.</span></p>

    judge’s conclusion, the matter can be resolved more simply: these were not the
    sort of rare circumstances in which it would be appropriate to find that the
    action was time barred in the context of a </span>r. 21.01(1)(a) <span
lang=EN-US>motion.</span></p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong><span lang=EN-US>The motion was not properly brought
    under r. 21.01(1)(a)</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The starting point is that an argument that a
    claim is barred by operation of the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> is a defence to a claim, and as such it must be pleaded in a
    statement of defence. Rule 25.07(4) makes this clear: “In a defence, a party
    shall plead any matter on which the party intends to rely to defeat the claim
    of the opposite party”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Attorney General seeks to dismiss the
    officers’ claim on the basis that it is time barred. It may well be, but the Attorney
    General must specifically so plead and has not done so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second problem is that the Attorney General
    seeks to use a </span>r. 21.01(1)(a) <span lang=EN-US>motion to assert the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US> defence that it has not
    pleaded. That rule involves the determination of a question of law raised in a
    pleading, and it is clear that the application of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></em><span lang=EN-US> is not a matter of law.
    This point has been made by this court on several occasions. For example, in </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Beardsley</span></em><span lang=EN-US> this court stated as follows,
    at paras. 21-22:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The motion to strike based on the expiry of a limitation period
    could only be made pursuant to rule 21.01(1)(a), which provides that a party
    may move for the determination of a question of law “<i>raised by a pleading</i>”.
    The expiry of a limitation period does not render a cause of action a nullity;
    rather, it is a defence and must be pleaded. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Plaintiffs would be deprived of
    the opportunity to place a complete factual context before the court if
    limitation defences were determined, on a routine basis, without being pleaded.
    Adherence to rules that ensure procedural fairness is an integral component of
    an appearance of justice. The appearance of justice takes on an even greater
    significance where claims are made against those who administer the law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    these remarks, this court stated in <em>Beardsley</em><i> </i>that it would be
    “unduly technical” to require a statement of defence to be delivered if “it is
    plain and obvious from a review of the statement of claim that no additional
    facts could be asserted that would alter the conclusion that a limitation
    period had expired”: at para. 21. To the extent that this comment created an
    exception, it was extremely limited in scope, as the example given makes clear:
    the expiry of the two-year limitation period under the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><i> </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8, in
    connection with a claim for property damage only, in circumstances in which the
    panel noted that the discoverability rule clearly did not apply.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    this court has not categorically precluded the use of r. 21.01(1)(a) on
    limitations matters in subsequent cases, in several cases it has sought to
    discourage its use. In <em>Metropolitan Toronto Condominium Corporation No.
    1352 v. Newport Beach Development Inc.</em>, 2012 ONCA 850, 113 O.R. (3d) 673,
    at para. 116, Laskin J.A. said that a defendant could move to strike a claim
    based on a limitation defence“[o]nly in the rarest of cases” if the defendant
    has yet to deliver a statement of defence. A fuller explanation was provided in <em>Salewski v. Lalonde</em>, 2017 ONCA 515, 137 O.R. (3d) 762, at para. 42, in
    which the panel stated that “this court’s comment in <em>Beardsley</em>” had
    “likely been overtaken by the enactment of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, 2002”.
    The court in <em>Salewski</em><i> </i>further limited the effect of the <i>Beardsley</i> comment by stating that it “was never intended to apply to a case that is
    legally or factually complex”: at para. 42.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    the panel in <em>Salewski</em> stated at para. 45 that, because the basic
    limitation period is now premised on the discoverability rule, the application
    of which raises mixed questions of law and fact, “[w]e therefore question
    whether there is now any circumstance in which a limitation issue under the Act
    can properly be determined under rule 21.01(1)(a) unless pleadings are closed
    and it is clear the facts are undisputed”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The situation contemplated in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Salewski</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> – the close of pleadings and the absence of any factual dispute –
    is very narrow, and this court has continued to discourage the use of r.
    21.01(1)(a) motions on limitations matters. In </span><em>Brozmanova v. Tarshis</em>,
    2018 ONCA 523, 81 C.C.L.I. (5th) 1, at para. 19, <span lang=EN-US>this court
    emphasized that “[t]he analysis required under s. 5(1) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Limitations Act</span></em><i><span lang=EN-US> </span></i><span
lang=EN-US>generally requires evidence and findings of fact to determine. It
    does not involve a ‘question of law’ within the meaning of rule 21.01(1)(a).” Justice
    Brown described reliance on r. 21.01(1)(a) to advance a limitation period
    defence as “a problematic use of the rule”, one that risks unfairness to a
    responding plaintiff: at paras. 17, 23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Kaynes
    v. BP, P.L.C.</em>, 2018 ONCA 337, 81 B.L.R. (5th) 6, does not undermine this
    approach. Although in that case this court agreed with the motion judge that the
    limitation issue could be determined under r. 21.01(1)(a), it did so on the
    basis of the parties’ agreement that there were no material facts in dispute,
    and in the context of an event-triggered limitation period under the <em>Securities
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5. This limitation period began to run without
    regard to the plaintiff’s knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of
    action, in contrast to the discovery-based limitation period under the <em>Limitations
    Act.</em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the Attorney General seeks to strike the officers’ claim under r.
    21.01(1)(a) because it is plain and obvious that no additional facts could be
    pleaded that would alter the conclusion that the limitation period has expired,
    as in <em>Beardsley</em>. The Attorney General says that the officers’ claim
    makes clear that they learned the material facts to support their claim against
    the trial Crown no later than October 18, 2013, and against the appeal Crown no
    later than December 12, 2013, and that both dates are well outside the two-year
    limitation period. Accordingly, says the Attorney General, there is no need to
    file a statement of defence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Salewski</em> says otherwise. The Attorney General seeks to diminish the authority of this
    case, arguing it is not clear whether this court heard argument on the matter
    and, in any event, that <i>Beardsley</i> is controlling authority that cannot
    be overturned except by a five-member panel of this court. Further, the Attorney
    General denies the existence of a novel claim exception, as suggested in <em>Boyce</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, <em>Salewski</em> is the controlling authority and limitations issues
    are not properly determined under r. 21.01(1)(a), unless pleadings are closed
    and the facts are undisputed. But even assuming that the <em>Beardsley</em> comment
    has not been overtaken by the <em>Limitations Act</em>, this is not an
    appropriate case in which to apply the exception <em>Beardsley</em> is
    understood as creating.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not say that there is an exception for novel litigation, nor do we say that
    this is novel litigation in any event. But it is unusual litigation, insofar as
    it attempts to impose a duty of care on Crown attorneys, and it is litigation
    against the Attorney General. As this court indicated at para. 22 of <em>Beardsley</em>,
    adherence to the rules – allowing the parties to have a complete factual record
    before the court prior to the determination of limitation defences – is a
    matter of procedural fairness, a matter of “even greater significance where
    claims are made against those who administer the law.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General takes the position that the officers failed to articulate what
    facts they could plead that would affect the discoverability of their claim for
    the purposes of the <em>Limitations Act</em>. But the Attorney General is, in
    essence, attempting to use r. 21.01(1)(a) for a purpose for which it was not
    designed. There is no obligation on the officers to facilitate its attempt to
    do so, nor is it appropriate for this court to vindicate a <em>Limitations Act</em> defence on the basis of a record that may well be incomplete.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for these reasons we would uphold the motion judge’s decision refusing to strike
    the officers’ claim on the basis that it is time barred.</p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Does the action lie against the Crown for negligence?</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General brought the motion to strike the negligence claim under r.
    21.01(1)(b) of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, which provides that “[a]
    party may move before a judge ... (b) to strike out a pleading on the ground
    that it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence”. The motion judge
    instructed himself correctly, at paras. 22-23, that the test on a motion to
    strike is whether it is “‘plain and obvious’ that the plaintiff's statement of
    claim discloses no reasonable cause of action,” assuming that the facts as
    stated in the statement of claim can be proven<em>: Hunt v. </em><em>Carey
    Canada Inc.</em>, at para. 36. He noted that all facts pleaded in the claim are
    accepted as true “unless they are manifestly incapable of being proven”
    (including because they are based on assumptions and speculation) or “patently
    ridiculous,” for which he cited numerous authorities.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well-settled that, based on Crown immunity principles, no claim lies against
    the Crown in negligence, whether it be simple or gross negligence; at common
    law, an action lies only in malicious prosecution: see <em>Nelles v. Ontario</em>,
    [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, at para. 55; <em>Proulx v. Quebec (Attorney General)</em>,
    2001 SCC 66, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 9, at para. 35; and <em>Miazga v. Kvello</em>,

    the Crown to proceed on the basis of wrongful non-disclosure. At the same time,
    the court affirmed its holdings in the trilogy that the Crown is immune from
    actions in negligence commenced by members of the public: at paras. 72, 74, 88,
    92-94.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the face of this wall of authority, the motion judge was asked to privilege the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the trilogy and <em>Henry</em>, the motion judge accepted that the only
    claims capable of penetrating the shield of Crown immunity are actions in
    malicious prosecution and wrongful non-disclosure: at para. 34. However, he
    relied on the decision in <em>Smith v. Her Majesty the Queen in right of
    Ontario et al.</em>, 2016 ONSC 7222, <span lang=EN-US>rev’d </span><em>Smith v.
    Attorney General of Ontario</em>, 2018 ONSC 993, 141 O.R. (3d) 309 (Div. Ct.), in
    which Matheson J. found that this body of cases was not dispositive of whether
    Crown attorneys are liable to the police for providing negligent legal advice.
    As Matheson J. said, at para. 136, “[t]he extensive body of law about common
    law immunity does not focus on lawsuits by the police against Crown Attorneys.”
    (The appeal from the Divisional Court to this court is under reserve.)</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the cases relied upon by Matheson J., the motion judge concluded, at
    para. 77: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>While a court might later decide that Crown Attorneys should
    also be immune from negligence claims by police officers, or indeed by any
    person, I agree with Matheson J. that it is not plain and obvious that such
    immunity has been recognized in the existing case law. I therefore decline to
    strike the officers' claim on the basis of common law Crown Attorney immunity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the motion judge released his reasons, the Divisional Court overturned the
    decision of Matheson J., holding that, based on existing jurisprudence, it is
    plain and obvious that Crown attorneys are immune from any claim based in negligence: <em>Smith v. Attorney General of Ontario</em>, 2018 ONSC 993, 141 O.R. (3d) 309
    (Div. Ct.).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    treating the matter as an open question, the motion judge conducted his own
    analysis under <em>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</em>, [1978] A.C. 728,
    and <em>Cooper v. Hobart</em>, 2001 SCC 79, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537, to determine
    whether Crown attorneys owe a duty of care to police officers. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General conceded that the reasonable foreseeability of harm component
    of the test had been satisfied. The proximity component was contentious. The
    motion judge found that the officers had established a relationship of
    proximity, thereby giving rise to a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care, albeit a
    narrow one. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge was not asked to find “an open-ended duty owed by Crown attorneys
    to all investigating officers”: at para. 100; rather, the proposed duty of care
    was limited to allegations of serious misconduct by police officers in the
    context of <i>Charter </i>motions. As the motion judge concluded, at para. 104:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, it is not plain and
    obvious that there would be no <i>prima facie</i> duty of care owed by <u>trial
    Crown Attorneys</u> to police officers to take reasonable care in the course of
    investigating and defending <i>Charter </i>motions alleging serious misconduct
    by police officers. Such a proximate relationship could arise from the fact
    that significant interests of police officers are engaged when they are subject
    to misconduct allegations on <i>Charter </i>motions that only Crown Attorneys
    are in a position to defend against. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    aspect of his holding essentially extinguished the negligence claim against the
    appeal Crown in this litigation. This was based on the motion judge’s earlier
    finding, at para. 93, that the appeal Crown “cannot have caused harm to the
    officers by failing to take steps that would have had no effect on the outcome
    of the appeal.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge qualified the <em>prima facie</em> duty even further. He held that
    it would not apply to situations where a Crown attorney enters a stay of
    proceedings. As he explained, at para. 105: “The proposed duty, if available,
    could only be available where an accused person has brought a <em>Charter </em>motion
    alleging serious misconduct and a court will be asked to hear evidence and
    decide the merits of the allegations.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge proceeded to the second stage of the <em>Anns/Cooper</em> framework and concluded that public policy considerations defeated the
    recognition of a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care. He conducted his analysis
    without an evidentiary record, relying instead on the analogous policy
    considerations discussed in the trilogy and in <em>Henry</em>. Applying these
    same considerations in the duty of care context, the motion judge found, at
    para. 137, that there were “valid and important policy reasons not to expand
    the civil liability of Crown Attorneys in a case such as this.” The claim was
    struck.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the motion judge’s decision to strike the negligence claim. However,
    we do so for different reasons. </p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong>Crown immunity: The existing jurisprudence is
    dispositive</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essential question before the motion judge was the scope of Crown immunity and
    whether it should be diluted to permit negligence claims by police officers.
    This aspect of Crown immunity has been squarely determined by the Supreme
    Court’s malicious prosecution trilogy and <em>Henry</em>. We are not persuaded
    that this line of authority can be avoided, simply by substituting one class of
    claimants (former accused persons) for another (police officers). As such, it
    is plain and obvious that the negligence claim cannot succeed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion should have been decided on this basis alone. There was no need to
    conduct an analysis under <em>Anns/Cooper</em>. In concluding that a duty of
    care ought not to be recognized, the motion judge relied on the same important
    policy considerations that animate the Supreme Court’s approach to Crown
    immunity. Analyzed under the duty of care paradigm, or as a Crown immunity
    problem, the result must be the same – the claim is doomed to fail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge erred in finding that existing case law was not dispositive of the
    tenability of the plaintiffs’ claim in negligence. The motion judge said, at
    para. 77: “With the exception of <em>Smith</em>, courts have not considered the
    potential Crown Attorney civil liability to police officers.” While this may be
    so, with respect, this approach was too narrow. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge was aware of this court’s decision in <em>Paton Estate v. Ontario
    Lottery and Gaming Commission</em>, 2016 ONCA 458, 131 O.R. (3d) 273, in which
    Pardu J.A. said, at para. 12: “It is not determinative, on a motion to strike,
    that the law has not yet recognized a particular claim. Rather, the court must
    ask whether it is plain and obvious that the claim has no reasonable prospect
    of success.” In <em>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd.</em>, 2011 SCC 42,
    [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45, McLachlin C.J. added, at para. 21: “The approach must be
    generous and err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to
    proceed to trial.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officers argue that their negligence claim should not have been struck at the
    pleadings stage because the motion judge was deprived of a proper evidentiary
    record. They submit that their claim is novel and that it is mere speculation
    that the policy considerations accepted in the trilogy and <em>Henry</em> are
    applicable to police officers as claimants. We reject both arguments. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    accept that any countervailing policy concerns relied upon to extend the reach
    of Crown immunity must be more than speculative: see <em>Fullowka v.
    Pinkerton’s of Canada Ltd.</em>, 2010 SCC 5, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 132, at para. 57.
    However, this does not necessarily require an evidentiary record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court considered this issue in <em>Arora v. Whirlpool Canada LP</em>, 2013 ONCA
    657, 118 O.R. (3d) 113, leave to appeal refused, [2013] S.C.C.A. No. 498,
    involving an appeal from a refusal to certify a class proceeding because it
    disclosed no cause of action: see s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>Class Proceedings Act</em><i>, </i>1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6. The motion judge had failed to find a duty of care
    under the <em>Anns/Cooper</em> test. The appellants argued that the motion
    judge should not have undertaken the policy analysis required under this test
    in the absence of a full factual record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Writing
    for the court, Hoy A.C.J.O. rejected this argument. She held, at para. 89, that
    “in certain circumstances” a policy analysis can be conducted on a pleadings
    motion. She raised a consideration that is significant on this appeal, at para.
    90: “It is also important to consider what, in a particular case, a factual
    record could reasonably be expected to add to the court’s determination.” She
    observed that counsel did not provide any “meaningful indication” of the nature
    of the policy evidence it would lead should the matter proceed further: at
    para. 91. During the oral hearing of this appeal, counsel for the officers was
    similarly unable to point to any potential evidence that would assist on the
    issue of policy. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    Hoy A.C.J.O. noted that the motion judge “had the benefit of a significant body
    of jurisprudence to assist in answering this precise question”: at para. 92.
    She further observed that the issue was not “entirely novel”, and that there
    was a detailed statutory framework and “abundant academic authority” on the
    issue: at para. 92.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is precisely the situation in this case. The issue is not “entirely novel”; the
    officers simply advance a variation on a familiar theme – the scope of Crown
    immunity in the context of criminal prosecutions. The Supreme Court has
    pronounced on this issue on no less than four occasions. On each occasion, the
    court provided extensive reasons, giving due consideration to the perils of
    exposing Crown attorneys to negligence claims. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Henry</em>, the court created a further exception to Crown immunity. That
    case was also decided at the pleadings stage. There was no new evidence
    touching on policy implications of allowing the plaintiff’s claim to proceed.
    We now consider <em>Henry</em> in more detail.</p>
  <p class=EmphasisStrong>The impact of Henry</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Henry</em> is significant for its recognition of a new cause of action against the Crown – <em>Charter</em> damages for wrongful non-disclosure in a criminal prosecution.
    The court rejected the Crown’s submission that, if such a cause of action is to
    be recognized, it should be predicated on a standard that approximates malice.
    Writing for the majority, Moldaver J. found that while malice did not provide a
    useful framework for analyzing when wrongful non-disclosure becomes actionable,
    “the policy underpinnings of this Court’s malicious prosecution jurisprudence
    inform the proper scope of Crown liability for <em>Charter </em>damages in this
    context”: at para. 32. They are also helpful in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court must undertake four tasks in determining a claim for <em>Charter</em> damages under <em>Ward</em>: (1) assess whether the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>has
    been breached; (2) establish why damages are a “just and appropriate remedy”;
    (3) consider any countervailing factors that could defeat a damages award; and
    (4) assess the quantum of damages (at para. 4). The second task bears
    similarities to the second stage of the <em>Anns/Cooper</em> test.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his analysis in <em>Henry</em>, Moldaver J. focused on the policy
    considerations recognized in the trilogy, which he recognized as “compelling
    good governance” concerns: at para. 71. First, appropriate thresholds for
    liability must ensure that Crown attorneys are not diverted from their
    important public duties by having to defend against a litany of civil claims. A
    standard that is too low runs that risk by allowing for an avalanche of civil
    proceedings. As Moldaver J. said, at para. 72: “The collective interest of
    Canadians is better served when Crown counsel are able to focus on their
    primary responsibility – the fair and effective prosecution of crime.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second good governance consideration is avoiding the creation of a chilling
    effect on Crown prosecutors (i.e., the fear of civil liability motivating
    defensive lawyering on the part of Crown attorneys). Moldaver J. said, at para.
    73: “The public interest is undermined when prosecutorial decision-making is
    influenced by considerations extraneous to the Crown’s role as a quasi-judicial
    officer.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Moldaver asserted, at para. 41: “These concerns are very real, and they provide
    compelling reasons why the availability of <em>Charter</em> damages should be
    circumscribed through the establishment of a high threshold.” This high
    threshold is reflected in the court’s malicious prosecution cases, just as it
    is in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on the review of Crown discretion in
    criminal cases. Pointing to the court’s decisions in <em>R. v. Anderson</em>,
    2014 SCC 41, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167, at para. 48, <em>Krieger v. Law Society of
    Alberta</em>, 2002 SCC 65, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372, at para. 32, and <em>R. v.
    Babos</em>, 2014 SCC 16, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 309, at para. 41, Moldaver J. said, at
    para. 49: “It is a bedrock principle that the exercise of core prosecutorial
    discretion is immune from judicial review, subject only to the doctrine of
    abuse of process.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Moldaver then drew a link between the abuse of process doctrine in the public
    law sphere and the requirement of malice in the private law sphere. He
    considered the standard reflected in the tort of malicious prosecution to be an
    “analogue” to the doctrine of abuse of process: at para. 50. At para. 51 of his
    reasons, Moldaver J. quoted from <em>Miazga</em>, in which Charron J. said, at
    para. 81, that “incompetence, inexperience, poor judgment, lack of
    professionalism, laziness, recklessness, honest mistake, negligence, or even
    gross negligence” will not underwrite a claim against the Crown.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court ultimately rejected a malice standard for claims for non-disclosure under
    s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter</em>. However, the teachings from <em>Nelles</em> and its progeny were safely preserved. As Moldaver J. said, at para. 66:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For these reasons, I reject the
    application of the malice standard. In doing so, <u>I do not in any way seek to
    undercut this Court’s malicious prosecution jurisprudence</u>. The qualified
    immunity established in <i>Nelles</i> continues to govern tort actions for
    malicious prosecution. Furthermore, as I will explain, while the malice
    standard is not directly applicable, the policy factors outlined in <i>Nelles</i> inform the liability threshold in this case. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Moldaver rejected the application judge’s preference for a negligence-based
    standard. He underscored this approach in the following passages of his
    judgment, at paras. 74, 76, 92 and 93:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For these reasons, I conclude that good governance concerns
    mandate a threshold that substantially limits the scope of liability for
    wrongful non-disclosure. <u>In my view, the standard adopted by the application
    judge, which is akin to gross negligence, does not provide sufficient limits.
    As I will explain, a negligence-type standard poses considerable problems, and
    ought to be rejected.</u></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>                                          …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>… However, the policy concerns raised in the malicious
    prosecution trilogy are not confined to the exercise of core prosecutorial
    discretion. In my view, <u>those concerns have a broader reach and are
    implicated wherever there is a risk of undue interference with the ability of
    prosecutors to freely carry out their duties in furtherance of the
    administration of justice.</u></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>Indeed, the consequences of setting a lower threshold in
    this context — simple negligence, or even the gross negligence standard adopted
    by the application judge — would be serious. This type of threshold implicates
    a duty of care paradigm that ignores the basic realities of conducting a
    criminal prosecution.</u></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>A duty of care paradigm risks
    opening up a Pandora’s Box of potential liability theories</u>. For example, if
    prosecutors were subject to a duty of care, a claimant could allege that they
    failed to probe the police forcefully enough to ensure that relevant
    information was not being suppressed. <u>Such an approach would effectively
    impose an obligation on prosecutors to “police” the police</u>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>Picking up on this last passage, it is equally
    unpalatable, and untenable for our criminal justice system, to equip the police
    with the means to “police” prosecutors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As <em>Henry</em> so powerfully demonstrates, the Supreme Court remains steadfast
    in its rejection of negligence-based claims against Crown attorneys. It could
    not be clearer. The officers attempt to side-step this entire line of
    jurisprudence by suggesting that the policy considerations are different when
    it comes to police officers. We disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first governance factor – the diversion of Crown attorneys from their primary
    duties – is equally valid when the police are substituted for former accused
    persons. Allowing for claims based in negligence would expose Crown attorneys
    to innumerable claims of police officers who feel aggrieved by decisions with
    which they do not agree. It would not serve the criminal justice system well
    for busy Crown attorneys to worry about being dragged into court to fight off
    the grievances of disgruntled police officers. It may well be that, in this
    case, the actions of the trial Crown had serious consequences for the officers;
    however, this is no reason to open the floodgates. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second governance factor – encouraging defensive lawyering by Crown attorneys –
    also remains valid in this context. Exposure to negligence claims by the police
    would encourage Crown attorneys to focus on extraneous factors during the
    course of a prosecution. This would tend to distort principled decision-making,
    in the same way as would the recognition of negligence claims by former accused
    persons. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of Crown attorneys to initiate, continue, or terminate a prosecution
    should be based on whether there is a reasonable prospect of conviction and
    whether the prosecution is in the public interest: <em>Miazga</em>, at para.
    64. The possibility of civil claims by the police would distort these venerable
    twin duties. It would have a deleterious effect on the administration of
    justice by undermining the public’s faith in the integrity of independent Crown
    decision-making. Moreover, exposing Crown attorneys to negligence claims by the
    police may result in prolonged court proceedings in which Crown attorneys make
    untenable prosecutorial decisions on <i>Charter</i> motions for fear of being
    sued. It would encourage the litigation of collateral issues, which does not
    sit well with the realities of finite criminal justice resources and the
    pressures of firm constitutional time constraints. See <em>R. v. Jordan</em>,
    2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are of the view that all of the policy considerations that informed the trilogy
    and <em>Henry</em> are operative in this case. Although the officers complain
    that the motion judge’s decision was made without a proper record, they point
    to nothing that might have some bearing on the policy considerations already
    embedded in the jurisprudence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span

lang=EN-US>Accordingly, on a straightforward application of the Supreme Court’s
    Crown immunity jurisprudence, it is plain and obvious that the officers’ claim
    in negligence must fail. The motion judge was right to strike this aspect of
    their claim: see </span><em>Thompson v. Ontario (Attorney General) </em><span

  <p class=EmphasisStrong>Additional issue raised by the Crown</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General has persuaded us that the motion judge erred in failing to
    find that the existing case law on Crown immunity was dispositive of the
    negligence claim. The Attorney General asks us to go further and “correct” the
    motion judge’s conclusion that there is a relationship of proximity between the
    police and Crown attorneys. It is unnecessary to do so for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conducting the second part of his <em>Anns/Cooper</em> analysis, the motion
    judge found that the same policy considerations that govern the scope of Crown
    immunity precluded a finding that Crown attorneys owe a duty of care to police
    officers. Allowing for the fact that he did not need to undertake this
    analysis, his reliance on these considerations was appropriate. There is a
    clear correspondence between the factors that animate the scope of Crown
    immunity and the countervailing factors to be considered at the second stage of
    the <em>Anns/Cooper</em> framework.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is illustrated by British case law. In <em>Henry</em>, Moldaver J., at para.
    72, referred to <em>Elguzouli-Daf v. Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis</em>,
    [1995] Q.B. 335, in which the Court of Appeal for England and Wales considered
    whether the Crown Prosecution Service owed a duty of care to persons it
    prosecuted. Assuming that reasonable foreseeability of harm could be
    established, the court found there was no relationship of proximity between
    prosecuted persons and the Crown Prosecution Service. The court also concluded
    that it would not be “fair, just or reasonable” to recognize such a duty. Lord
    Justice Steyn (as he then was) wrote, at p. 349: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>I conclude that there are compelling considerations, rooted in
    the welfare of the community, which outweigh the dictates of individual
    justice. I would rule that there is no duty of care owed by the C.P.S. to those
    it prosecutes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    decision has been cited with approval on many occasions, including by the House

    also refer to the alternative finding of the Court of Appeal. As Steyn L.J.
    explained, at p. 349:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I have rested my judgment on the
    absence of a duty of care on the part of the C.P.S. If my conclusion is wrong,
    I would <u>for the reasons I have given in dealing with the question whether a
    duty of care exists rule that the C.P.S. is immune from liability in
    negligence.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    passage illustrates the considerable correspondence between duty of care policy
    considerations and the scope of Crown immunity. All roads lead to the same
    destination – the Crown is not liable to police officers in negligence – and it
    is unnecessary to embark upon a parallel analytical path only to end up in the
    same place. A proper articulation of whether and under what circumstances a
    relationship of proximity exists between Crown attorneys and police requires a
    fact-specific analysis that is unnecessary in this case. We decline to engage
    in a hypothetical inquiry that is properly saved for a scenario in which it is
    required. </p>

    focuses in particular on the Crown’s conduct of the appeal. This court’s reasons
    were especially hard on the officers, noting that their “conduct in this case
    might well be characterized as ‘torture’”. The court noted, at para 43, to
    repeat:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>What occurred here was the
    administration of a calculated, prolonged and skilfully choreographed
    investigative technique developed by these officers to secure evidence. This

    argues that Crown attorneys are immune from liability for misfeasance in public

    that Crown attorneys are immune from liability for negligence in the performance

    from their duties and could have a chilling effect on their conduct. These were

    para. 35, per Iacobucci and Binnie JJ. In <em>Miazga</em>, Charron J. said, at
    para. 51:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Thus, the public law doctrine of
    abuse of process and the tort of malicious prosecution may be seen as two sides
    of the same coin: both provide remedies when a Crown prosecutor's actions are
    so egregious that they take the prosecutor outside his or her proper role as
    minister of justice, such that the general rule of judicial non-intervention
    with Crown discretion is no longer justified. Both abuse of process and
    malicious prosecution have been narrowly crafted, employing stringent tests, to
    ensure that liability will attach in only the most exceptional circumstances,
    so that Crown discretion remains intact.</p>

    sought to amend the test from </span><em>Nelles</em><span style='line-height:

    presents too high a barrier,” but Charron J. rejected these arguments, at para.
    52, because they “are ill-conceived and do not account for the careful
    balancing established in </span><em>Nelles</em><span style='line-height:200%'> and </span><em>Proulx</em><span style='line-height:200%'> between the right of
    individual citizens to be free from groundless criminal prosecutions and the

    preserve this balance.” See also paras. 79-84.</span></p>

    misfeasance in public office set out in </span><em>Odhavji</em><span
