  <p class=Namesofparty>AN APPEAL UNDER PART XX.1 OF THE <em>CODE</em></p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Kelley Bryan, for appellant</p>
  <p class=Nameofcounsel>Joe Hanna, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard: March 29, 2019</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the disposition of the Ontario Review
    Board dated, August 2, 2018.</p>
  <p><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, Samuel Kassa, has been diagnosed with
    schizophrenia in addition to cocaine and cannabis use disorders. He has been
    under the jurisdiction of the Ontario Review Board since he was found not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (“NCR”) for uttering a
    threat to cause bodily harm on July 19, 2012. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the time of his most recent hearing before
    the Board, the appellant was 43 years of age. He appeals the disposition dated
    August 2, 2018 arising from that hearing, concluding that he continues to
    constitute a “significant threat to the safety of the public” and ordering that
    he continue to be detained at the General Forensic Unit of the Ontario Shores
    Centre for Mental Health Sciences </span>(the “Hospital”)<span lang=EN-US> pending transfer to the General Forensic Unit of the Centre for Addiction and
    Mental Health (“CAMH”). The appellant asks that the disposition be set aside
    and that he be discharged absolutely or, in the in the alternative, that he be
    discharged subject to conditions or, in the further alternative, that the
    matter be returned to the Board with directions for a new hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Hospital takes no position on the appeal. The Crown argues
    that the appeal should be dismissed and the Board’s disposition affirmed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>For the following reasons, I would allow the appeal and
    return the matter to the Board for a new hearing.</span></p>
  <h1>Background </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The index offence of uttering a death threat arose out of an incident on
    July 28, 2010. The appellant went to CAMH intending to see his addictions
    counsellor, but the security guard told him to leave the building, probably
    because he was barefoot. The appellant saw a TTC operator stationed at the
    corner. The appellant paced in that area and engaged in conversation with the
    TTC operator. The appellant indicated that the TTC operator called him an “asshole”.
    The appellant walked up to the TTC operator, lifted his right arm up and put
    his hand out as if he were holding a gun, then stated: “Fuck you, you’re dead”.
    He walked away, then turned around and came back within 10 feet of the TTC
    operator. He repeated the gesture, this time not saying anything. At the time,
    the appellant was using crack cocaine and cannabis and was likely non-compliant
    with antipsychotic medication.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The report dated July 5, 2018 of his treatment team at the Hospital
    noted that it was difficult to view the appellant’s actions on July 28, 2010
    “as having the potential to cause ‘serious’ psychological harm”, and there was
    no reported physical harm. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, during his tenure under the Board, the appellant had not
    exhibited any behaviour that reasonably could be viewed as having the potential
    to cause serious physical or psychological harm. Indeed, he had been assaulted
    twice in the past year and did not respond with any form of aggression. The
    Hospital described the appellant as remaining calm, cooperative and stable
    during the reporting period. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hospital reviewed the appellant’s behavior before he came under the
    Board’s jurisdiction that could have potentially led to serious harm:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2000, the appellant was charged with dangerous operation of a
    motor vehicle. The available materials suggest that he drove through a red
    light, rear ended a slower car, and drove at speeds of over 150 km/h. This may
    have been a suicide attempt and led to his first psychiatric contact in Canada.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2005, the appellant started a fire in his apartment and was
    throwing items off his balcony. No additional detail was available. The
    appellant said he had been attacked by a friend who was using drugs. The friend
    left trousers in the appellant’s apartment, and the appellant said he put them
    on the stove. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2009, the appellant reportedly set fires in his apartment to
    notify people of the upcoming civic elections. The appellant claims that he did
    not actually start a fire. Rather, he was using his lighter to try to set off
    the fire alarm.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2009, the appellant was convicted of threaten bodily harm and
    weapons dangerous. He received a conditional discharge and two years’
    probation. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2010, the appellant was accused of threatening a physician at
    CAMH. The synopsis indicated that he became agitated when told he was not going
    to be admitted to hospital and threw milk, and then the carton, on the
    physician. He then allegedly threatened to come back with a gun and shoot the
    doctor.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2011, the appellant was charged with assault. This may have
    been in respect of the 2010 incident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hospital concluded that it did not appear that the appellant had
    ever caused serious physical or psychological harm, although his driving in
    2000 and fire setting in 2005 and 2009 “would certainly have the potential for
    serious injury to another person”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Hospital reported that the appellant’s insight into his schizophrenia is good,
    he has adhered to his long-acting medication regime, and his psychosis was
    fully remitted, although he struggles with substance abuse on an ongoing basis.
    The appellant had availed himself of multiple interventions to address his
    substance abuse. The Hospital concluded that because it remained likely that
    the appellant would continue to use substances with regularity, if the
    appellant were granted an absolute discharge, it was unlikely that he would be
    able to maintain housing on an indefinite basis and, should he end up homeless,
    it would be very difficult to ensure that he receives consistent treatment in the
    community. Accordingly, it was likely the appellant will “eventually fall away
    from psychiatric treatment.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Hospital wrote:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In short, in the event of an absolute discharge, it is likely
    that [the appellant] will continue to have significant challenges with
    substance abuse. He is likely to have further interactions with the criminal
    justice system in relation to this. Should he act in a manner that is likely to
    cause significant harm this will likely flow from untreated psychosis. So long
    as [the appellant] remains on antipsychotic treatment, we can only say that his
    continued drug usage is potentially linked to problematic symptoms. Even in the
    worst-case scenario where [the appellant] is homeless, non-compliant with
    antipsychotic medication, and actively using crack cocaine and cannabis, the
    view of the treatment team is that we can only conclude that this might lead to
    serious harm through reckless behaviour.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    prior years, the Hospital had concluded that the appellant was a significant
    threat to the safety of the public. The Hospital considered whether the
    appellant met the significant threat threshold “in light of the clarification”
    by this court in <em>Wall (Re)</em>, 2017 ONCA 713, 417 D.L.R. (4th) 124, since
    the Hospital’s prior report. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> By
    way of context, in <em>Wall</em>, the appellant’s diagnoses included bipolar
    disorder and polysubstance abuse. Prior to the index offence, Mr. Wall had
    accumulated an extensive criminal record, including robbery, assault, and
    assault with a weapon. At his hearing, the question of significant threat was
    linked to his cannabis use and its impact on his bipolar affective disorder.
    Mr. Wall was treatment capable and compliant with medication. His physician
    testified that he would continue with treatment if discharged. He was willing
    to consent to a Community Treatment Order (“CTO”). Until shortly before the
    Board’s decision, his bipolar disorder was well managed by medication and
    unaffected by his ongoing use of marijuana. But his treating physician linked
    recent signs of mania to his marijuana use and testified that when manic he may
    pose a risk of violent and transgressive behavior.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court held that “the only evidence connected to the risk of physical harm…was
    dated and speculative” and that the Board could conclude no more than that Mr.
    Wall’s marijuana use was “<em>potentially linked to problematic symptoms</em>”.
    As a result, the court found that the Board’s decision was unreasonable, set
    aside the order of the Board, and granted an absolute discharge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Hospital concluded that there were several similarities between the appellant’s
    situation and that of Mr. Wall. Further, it noted that the appellant had
    indicated that he is willing to have a CTO and continue with medication by
    long-acting injection. The Hospital recommended that he be discharged
    absolutely. If not, the Hospital recommended that the appellant be detained in
    a secure forensic unit because his substance use cannot be adequately addressed
    while allowing him indirectly supervised privileges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to his hearing before the Board, the appellant signed a CTO.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s treating physician, Dr. Morgan, testified before the Board. He
    noted that while on medication the appellant displays no psychotic symptoms
    when he uses cannabis and cocaine. It is only when he uses the synthetic
    cannabinoid “Spice” that he develops psychotic symptoms, but those are mild.
    Further, the appellant has openly admitted to his drug use and has returned to
    hospital voluntarily after elopements to use drugs. He has described coming
    back to the hospital as a “vacation”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Morgan reiterated that he did not believe that any actions by the appellant if
    he engaged in substance abuse and became medication non-compliant would cause
    serious physical or psychological harm to others. However, he conceded that the
    appellant’s actions “could” do so, although that had not historically been the
    case. The Hospital reiterated its recommendation that the appellant receive an
    absolute discharge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board did not accept the Hospital’s position. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    concluded that this case was not like <em>Wall</em>. It was clear that Mr. Wall
    would remain treatment compliant if discharged, whereas Dr. Morgan’s evidence
    was that the appellant would likely stop his medication if discharged. Further,
    the CTO that the appellant had signed was not a guarantee of compliance. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board purported to apply the standard for determining significant threat set
    out by the Supreme Court in <em>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric
    Institute)</em>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 625, which the Board summarized as whether the
    accused poses a serious risk of substantial psychological or physical harm to
    others. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board found that there was a clear pattern of activity. While it acknowledged
    that none of the appellant’s actions had resulted in substantial psychological
    or physical harm to others, it found that the threshold for “significant threat
    to the safety of the public” was met because “there is a serious likelihood
    that such actions in the future <span class=Underline>could</span> result in
    significant harm particularly if Mr. Kassa is medication noncompliant” (emphasis
    added). The Board concluded that the appellant continues to constitute a
    “significant threat to the safety of the public”. It found that the alternative
    of detention in a secure forensic facility recommended by the Hospital was not
    the least onerous and restrictive alternative and ordered that he continue to
    be detained at the General Forensic Unit of the Hospital pending transfer to
    the General Forensic Unit of CAMH.</p>
  <h1>Issues on Appeal</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his oral submissions, the appellant clarified that he does not challenge the
    Board’s disposition on the basis that it was unreasonable. Rather, he argues
    that the Board failed to apply the proper legal test for “significant threat to
    the safety of the public” in two ways. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in considering whether significant harm “could” result, the Board descended
    into the realm of speculation, contrary to both <em>Winko</em> and this court’s
    decision in <em>Wall</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Board failed to consider the likelihood of the appellant engaging in criminal
    conduct resulting in physical or psychological harm, and the seriousness of the
    harm that might occur <span class=Underline>together</span>, as required by <em>Winko</em>,
    at para. 57. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span

    672.54(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> directs that where an NCR accused is
    “not a significant threat to the safety of the public” he or she must be
    discharged absolutely.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    672.5401 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> defines a “significant threat to the
    safety of the public” to mean “a risk of serious physical or psychological harm
    to members of the public – including any victim of or witness to the offence,
    or any person under the age of 18 years – resulting from conduct that is
    criminal in nature but not necessarily violent.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Winko</em><i>, </i>the Supreme Court describes, at para. 57, what amounts
    to a significant threat to the safety of the public: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he threat must be more than speculative in
    nature; it must be supported by evidence. The threat must also be
    “significant”, both in the sense that there must be a real risk of physical or
    psychological harm occurring to individuals in the community and in the sense
    that this potential harm must be serious. A miniscule risk of a grave harm will
    not suffice. Similarly, a high risk of trivial harm will not meet the
    threshold. Finally, the conduct or activity creating the harm must be criminal
    in nature. In short, Part XX.1 can only maintain its authority over an NCR
    accused where… the individual poses a significant risk of committing a serious
    criminal offence. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the contemplated conduct must be criminal, not all criminal
    conduct will meet this standard. There must be a risk that the NCR accused will
    commit a <span class=Underline>serious</span> criminal offence: <em>Winko</em><i>, </i>at paras. 57, 69.</p>

    arising from criminal conduct: at paras. 51, 57. “Could” does not suggest the
    “real” risk that <em>Winko</em> requires. Moreover, the Board did not expressly
