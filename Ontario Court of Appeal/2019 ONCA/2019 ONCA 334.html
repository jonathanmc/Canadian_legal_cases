  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>I.        </span><span lang=EN-GB
style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Following an 8-day trial in 2015 on 21 counts
    contained in 3 informations, the appellant, Richard Orton, was convicted of 14
    counts, 1 of which was stayed applying the principle in <em>R. v. Kienapple</em>,
    [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The various offences of which the appellant was convicted
    included dangerous driving, mischief to property, intimidation, and criminal
    harassment. They are described in detail later in these reasons. The appellant
    was sentenced to a 12-month conditional sentence, followed by two years’ probation.
    In addition, ancillary orders were imposed, including a five-year driving
    prohibition.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Five of the charges proceeded by way of
    indictment. The appellant was convicted of two of them and appeals. The other
    convictions were in respect of summary conviction offences. The appellant seeks
    leave to appeal those convictions on the basis that they are factually
    intertwined with some of the convictions that the appellant may appeal as of
    right; the respondent does not oppose leave being granted. Consequently, I
    would grant leave to appeal the summary convictions, and I will deal with both
    types of convictions together.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant did not testify at the trial but
    did call some witnesses as part of his defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant advances grounds of appeal common
    to all convictions, as well as others specific to certain convictions. One
    overarching ground of appeal is that the trial judge’s reasons are insufficient
    in two main respects: they fail to explain why he did not accept the evidence
    of the defence witnesses; and they lack any real analysis of how the Crown
    established the essential elements of the offences. As a related submission,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge applied a higher standard of
    scrutiny to the evidence called by the defence than to the Crown’s evidence. I
    will consider these common challenges when dealing with each group of charges. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>For certain convictions, the appellant also
    argues that the trial judge erred with respect to the essential elements of the
    offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>For the reasons that follow, I would not give
    effect to any of the grounds of appeal advanced by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>II.       THE JUNE 22, 2013 DRIVING INCIDENT</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>A.      THE CHARGES</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In respect of a June 22, 2013 driving incident
    in North Bay, the appellant was charged with: one count of dangerous driving (<em>Criminal
    Code</em> s. 249); two counts of criminal harassment by threatening conduct (s.
    264(2)(d)); and two counts of intimidation by following in a disorderly manner
    (s. 423(1)(e)) in relation to the occupants of another vehicle, Darren Binz and
    Carly Bishop.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant was convicted on all counts.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>B.      THE EVIDENCE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The charges concerned the interaction on June
    22, 2013 in North Bay between the Honda Civic driven by the appellant, bearing
    the personalized licence plate RIKYO, and a pickup truck driven by Darren Binz.
    Carly Bishop was a passenger in Mr. Binz’s truck. A dispute existed as to
    whether the passenger in the appellant’s truck was his wife, Laurie Orton, or a
    younger female.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The incident started when Mr. Binz attempted to
    change lanes on Lakeshore Drive approaching Main Street. The appellant’s car
    was slightly behind the truck, travelling in the lane into which Mr. Binz
    attempted to move. Mr. Binz did not check his blind spot before he started to
    move over; he started to cut off the appellant, who honked; and Mr. Binz moved
    back into his lane.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>According to Mr. Binz and Ms. Bishop, the
    appellant then drove up alongside the Binz car and yelled at Mr. Binz to pull
    over, claiming that he had captured everything on a dash camera. Mr. Binz did
    not pull over because he was extremely scared at that point. He continued
    driving, veering left on Main Street at the “Y”-intersection with McIntyre
    Street East. The appellant angled right along McIntyre.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>After a block, Mr. Binz turned right onto John Street
    to make his way up to Seymour Street, where his girlfriend worked at a
    restaurant. He saw the appellant’s car turn left from McIntyre onto John into
    the lane in which Mr. Binz was travelling and drive straight towards the Binz
    car. Ms. Bishop testified to the same effect. Both Mr. Binz and Ms. Bishop said
    that just as the appellant reached their truck, he turned his car in front of
    them at a 90-degree angle, blocking their lane. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Binz drove around the appellant, who
    followed. According to Mr. Binz, the appellant moved into the lane of oncoming
    traffic, crossing a solid line, passed the two or three cars that were between
    their vehicles, and then tailgated his truck in an extremely close fashion,
    through several left and right-hand turns, until the intersection of Seymour
    Street and Highway 11. At that point, Mr. Binz waved his cellphone in the air
    to convey that he was going to call the police. The appellant then turned left
    onto the highway. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Laurie Orton testified that she was a passenger
    in the appellant’s car. She and her husband were on their way to the Northgate
    Shopping Mall. Ms. Orton testified that the appellant had yelled to the other
    car that they were driving in a reckless fashion and she had pointed to the
    dash camera at the car. The truck went off to the left on Main Street, while
    they went to the right on McIntyre. They stopped at a red light at the
    intersection of McIntyre and John Streets.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Ms. Orton stated that the truck passed in front
    of them travelling along John Street on the green light at the intersection
    with McIntyre. Although the truck was moving away from them, Ms. Orton
    testified that she and the appellant actually thought the truck was trying to
    follow them. When their light turned green, instead of continuing along the direct
    route to the Northgate Shopping Mall – driving straight along McIntyre to
    Fisher Street and then turning right - they decided to turn right onto John
    Street and follow the truck. According to Ms. Orton, they wanted to take down
    the licence plate number and report it to the police. They continued to follow
    the truck all the way to Highway 11, then turned left to the shopping mall. Ms.
    Orton denied that the appellant had blocked traffic on John Street. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant placed a 911 call at 4:43 p.m.;
    Mr. Binz placed a separate call a minute later. In his call, the appellant was
    emphatic that he had been the victim of Mr. Binz’s erratic driving and that he
    had a video capturing the incident. No video of the events was ever located.
    Mr. Binz’s 911 call did not mention the 90-degree maneuver. He only stated that
    the appellant had been passing, chasing, and driving in the wrong lane.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>C.      <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>The
    trial judge’s reasons</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge stated that the determination of
    whether the Crown had proven each and every element of the offences, in the
    circumstances, turned on the credibility of the three witnesses: Mr. Binz; Ms.
    Bishop; and Ms. Orton. He expressly instructed himself on the principles set
    out in <em>R. v. W.D.</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. As well, he noted the
    principle articulated by this court in <em>R. v. J.J.R.D.</em> (2006), 215
    C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [2007] 1 S.C.R.
    x (note), at para. 53, that “[a]</span><span lang=EN-GB>n outright rejection of
    an accused’s evidence based on a considered and reasoned acceptance beyond a
    reasonable doubt of the truth of conflicting credible evidence is as much an
    explanation for the rejection of an accused’s evidence as is a rejection based
    on a problem identified with the way the accused testified or the substance of
    the accused’s evidence.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge accepted as credible and
    reliable the evidence of Mr. Binz and Ms. Bishop, in large part because their accounts
    of the events were consistent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>He did not accept Ms. Orton’s evidence as
    reliable or credible for several reasons: on cross-examination she became vague
    and non-responsive to some basic elements of what happened and, towards the
    end, aggressive; at one point she testified that she did not remember specific
    details; and her testimony that she thought the truck was chasing them, so they
    decided to follow it, did not make sense. As well, based on the descriptions
    given by Mr. Binz and Ms. Bishop that the passenger in the appellant’s car was
    a young female under the age of 20, the trial judge had serious concerns as to
    whether Ms. Orton - who testified that she was 45 years old - was in fact a
    passenger at the time of the incident. For those reasons, he rejected her
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge concluded that the Crown had
    established beyond a reasonable doubt that: the appellant’s driving on the date
    in question amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care that a
    reasonable person would have observed and presented a danger to the public;
    blocking the Binz vehicle’s lane of travel on John Street was conduct that was
    threatening in nature, which created some reasonable fear to both Ms. Bishop
    and Mr. Binz; and crossing a solid line to pass motor vehicles in the opposing
    lane of traffic and then following someone in a disorderly and aggressive
    fashion met the elements of the offence of intimidation by following in a
    disorderly manner.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant advances numerous grounds of
    appeal regarding the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence about this
    incident. I shall deal with each. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant contends that the trial judge
    improperly and unfairly subjected the evidence called by the appellant to a
    heightened degree of scrutiny, specifically the evidence given by his wife, Ms.
    Orton:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-GB>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>According to the appellant, the overt criticism
    of Ms. Orton’s lack of memory of precise details of the driving incident stands
    in sharp contrast to the forgiveness of the inconsistences between Mr. Binz and
    Ms. Bishop in their versions of that same event;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-GB>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge appeared to draw an adverse
    inference from the fact that Ms. Orton spent less time dealing with the topic
    of the June 22, 2013 incident in her examination-in-chief than she did in
    cross-examination. The appellant contends that no Crown witness was subjected

    ground of appeal to advance. In order to succeed with an argument that a trial
    judge applied a different and stricter standard of scrutiny to defence
    evidence, it is not enough to show that a different trial judge could have
    reached a different credibility assessment, or that the trial judge failed to
    say something that he could have said in assessing the respective credibility
    of the complainant and the accused, or that he failed to set out expressly
    legal principles relevant to that credibility assessment. Instead, an appellant
    must point to something in the reasons or elsewhere in the record that make it
    clear the trial judge applied different standards in assessing the evidence of
    the appellant and the complainant: <em>R. v. Howe</em> (2005), 192 C.C.C. (3d)

    Mr. Binz, Ms. Bishop, and Ms. Orton does not bear out the appellant’s
    submission of uneven scrutiny. The trial judge accurately noted that Ms. Orton
    testified that she was unable to remember many details of the incident, some of
    them quite important ones. The trial judge did not draw an adverse inference
    from the comparative lengths of her examination-in-chief and cross-examination.
    He did fairly state that the incident was “only addressed very briefly during
    examination-in-chief.” The transcript supports the trial judge’s description of
    Ms. Orton’s answers in many places as vague and unresponsive. And while Crown
    counsel did not directly suggest to Ms. Orton in cross-examination that she was
    not in the car at the time, he did ask a series of questions that indirectly
    put that suggestion to her.</span></p>

    misapprehended the evidence by characterizing the existence or non-existence of
    the dash cam video as a red herring. The appellant contends that “the trial
    judge ought to have considered whether evidence of the existence of the dash
    camera during the events in question, including the evidence of Mr. Binz, in
    conjunction with the Appellant’s immediate and spontaneous declaration to the
    police that he possessed exculpatory video evidence, raised a reasonable doubt

    informed the operator that he had a video of the incident. In a conversation
    with Cst. Drolet a few days after the incident, the appellant stated the
    incident had been recorded on his dash cam and the video would not incriminate
    him. Transcripts of the 911 call and conversation with Cst. Drolet were entered
    into evidence.</span></p>

    exculpate the appellant simply because the appellant had made that assertion
    during his conversation with Cst. Drolet. In those circumstances, the trial
    judge regarded the existence or non-existence of the video as a “red herring on
    this trial” because “[t]his Court has not received the video in evidence and
    makes no conclusion from any reference to it on the fact - or from the fact
    that same has not been tendered as evidence.” I see no error in that statement.</span></p>

    judge failed to give effect to important inconsistencies between the statements
    made by Mr. Binz in his initial 911 call and his evidence at trial. The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in discounting the content of the
    911 call because it was not a “statement”.</span></p>

    characterize Mr. Binz’s 911 call as a “statement”; he described it as a
    “complaint” to the police. Nevertheless, the trial judge did not ignore the
    defence argument that Mr. Binz’s credibility was weakened because he did not
    mention in his 911 call that the appellant had blocked his passage on John
    Street. The trial judge directly addressed that discrepancy, placing the 911
    call in context when assessing its weight and consistency with other evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>These types of calls are quick [in] nature and
    only provide the highlights or basic facts of what occurred. One must recall
    that Mr. Binz testified that this was one of the scariest moments of his life
    and the call was made within minutes, if not seconds, of it and forgetting or
    brushing off some details can be understood. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>However, he does clearly explain to 911 that

    that he was not left with a reasonable doubt notwithstanding the absence of

    stated that instead of taking the direct route to the shopping mall, the
    appellant made a right turn in order to follow the truck, ostensibly to take
    down its licence plate number. In his reasons, the trial judge questioned why
    the appellant would follow a truck that, on Ms. Orton’s evidence, they thought
    was trying to chase them. Given the implausibility of her explanation, it is

    on the rolled-down driver’s window; placed his left hand on the appellant’s
    wrist and his right hand on the appellant’s  bicep; and told him that he was
    under arrest. The appellant looked at the officer, said “like fuck,” pulled his
    arm away, and started to put the truck in motion. Cst. McFarlane put his arm into
    the truck to reach for the keys. At the same time, the vehicle started to mount
    the curb towards an adjacent parking lot. Cst. McFarlane stated that his arm
    was caught in the window and he was dragged with the truck, but was able to get

    counsel agreed that in light of Ms. Lamabe’s medical condition, she would not
    be required to continue with her evidence. The trial judge generally agreed
    with the position of the defence on how to treat the evidence that she had
    given: where the evidence was con&#64257;rmed by other independent evidence, it

    Ms. Lamabe’s evidence in-chief that the officer who reached into the truck was
    not dragged by the vehicle. According to the appellant, part of the error consisted
    of the trial judge mischaracterizing Ms. Lamabe’s evidence that the officer was
    not dragged by the vehicle and his arm was not pinned by the vehicle’s window.
    The trial judge described that evidence as given in response to leading
    questions. The appellant argues that the questions were not leading, just
    focused. </span></p>

    open to the trial judge to discount Ms. Lamabe’s evidence in light of his
    ruling that accepted the defence position on how to use her untested evidence.
    The trial judge preferred the evidence of the three police officers at the
    scene, which did not support that of Ms. Lamabe on this point. However,
    contrary to the appellant’s submission, the trial judge did not use their
    evidence to find that the appellant “dragged” Cst. McFarlane with his truck or
    pinned the officer’s arm with the vehicle’s window, thereby committing the
    offence of dangerous driving. Instead, the trial judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>I do agree with Defence Counsel that Constable
    McFarlane was not dragged by the Orton vehicle. In my view, the word dragged
    does not properly describe what happened. It is clear in my mind that the Orton
    vehicle started to move from a parked position while Constable McFarlane was
    still reaching inside the window. He is clearly able to exit the window before
    the vehicle accelerated at a high rate of speed.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-GB>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>It is clear that leaving from a parked
    position while somebody is reaching inside your motor vehicle is dangerous.
    This combined with the fact that Mr. Orton pulled over a curb into a parking
    lot on two occasions, made no attempts to slow down or stop at the intersection
    of Lee or George Avenue, proceeded through a red light at the intersection of
    Lakeshore Drive and Judge Avenue, and simply slowed down at a stop sign at the
    intersection of Sherbrooke and Worthington are all, in my view, an indication
    that he was driving in a manner dangerous to the public.</span></p>

    that he was at that time in lawful custody. The issue is that defence is
    suggesting that Mr. Orton was justified in escaping as he had a reasonable

    had a reasonable basis to believe that he was being attacked.</span></p>

    door to the appellant. In 2009 or 2010, their relationship with the appellant
    soured. The appellant would ride his mower onto the McLuhans’ lawn, damaging
    it. The McLuhans complained about loud music frequently coming from the
    appellant’s garage during the day, often when he was not at home. Ms. McLuhan
    went to the police and was advised to start keeping a journal of incidents with
    the appellant, which she did. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Ms. McLuhan also testified about the appellant’s
    noisy driving in the neighbourhood: he would rev the engine and spin the wheels
    of his truck as he drove down the road and would do “burnouts” inside of his
    garage, which resulted in the emission of smoke when the garage door opened.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant would also insult her when she was
    hanging clothes outside, saying: “Well I guess the fucker’s going out to hang
    her clothes”. After the McLuhans complained to the police about the noisy music
    from the appellant’s garage, he yelled at them: “See you old fuckers, nobody
    telling me what to do.” The next day, Ms. McLuhan heard the appellant loudly
    singing: “Bob’s an old fucker, a real old fucker.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Ms. McLuhan also testified that her house once
    got egged and painted with a swastika. She later confirmed that she did not
    know if her house had been mistaken for that of the appellant, who had been
    charged with sexual offences in 2009 and 2010. Although ultimately acquitted on
    some of the charges, with others disposed of by way of a peace bond, the
    appellant’s house had been the target of several episodes of vandalism. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Ms. Orton testified that several police officers
    had attended from time-to-time in response to noise complaints. When Cst.
    Parker attended, the radio was on in the garage although no one was in it at
    the time. She went with him into the garage to determine an acceptable level
    for the music. She placed a scratch on the radio knob to indicate the level. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Ms. Orton claimed that she had never experienced
    her husband spinning tires or revving an engine in the driveway. She did
    testify that he might rev the truck engine in the garage, if he was testing it.
    She confirmed he might do this without her knowledge. Ms. Orton testified that
    the oral exchanges between the appellant and the McLuhans usually were polite
    and calm. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-GB>C.      The trial judge’s reasons</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In convicting the appellant of the offence of
    mischief to the McLuhans’ property, the trial judge accepted the evidence of
    Ms. McLuhan about the events she described. He rejected Ms. Orton’s evidence,
    primarily on the basis that, while she first had denied that there was loud
    music in the garage, ultimately she admitted that she knew the music from the
    garage was too loud. The trial judge continued:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>I do agree with Defence Counsel that Ms.
    McLuhan does not know who was turning on the radio that was too loud.  It is
    clear that she did not have a direct view into the garage to see who was in the
    garage. If the only evidence to support this charge was the loud radio, the
    Crown would have difficulties in obtaining a conviction.  However, there is
    much more than that. Ms. McLuhan clearly saw Richard Orton in his motor
    vehicle, revving the engine and spinning the tires. She clearly saw him and
    heard him yelling obscenities to her and her husband on a number of occasions.
    She was clear that the bullying behaviour of Mr. Orton clearly interfered with
    her enjoyment of the property to a point that they had to move and relocate.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>I am therefore satisfied, beyond a reasonable
    doubt, the Crown has proven all the elements of the offence and accordingly
    there will be a finding of guilt. </span></p>

    Summit and come towards them in the lane in which they were walking. The truck
    started to pull into the other lane to pass by them but then accelerated

    incident had occurred in June 2011, when the weather was warm and there were
    leaves on the trees. However, Ms. Sands testified that she spoke with Mr. Vibe
    after the December incident in the School office. At that time, Mr. Vibe told
    her he had thrown the wrapper on to the appellant’s property in retaliation for
    an incident in the previous week or two when the appellant had backed his truck

    because of something that had happened earlier about almost getting run over.
    Mr. Dickson had no knowledge of that event. On cross-examination, Mr. Dickson

    judge squarely grappled with the defence argument that the inconsistencies in
    Mr. Vibe’s evidence regarding the timing of the driving incident rendered his
    testimony incredible and unreliable. He did not accept the argument. He
    explained why at some length in his reasons, stating:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>First, one must remember that this incident
    happened when Zack Vibe was 15 years of age. He testified in June 2015
    concerning an incident that happened in 2011. He presented himself to the Court
    in a clear, competent fashion. He would respond to the question posed to him by
    both the Crown and defence. He agreed with the suggestion made by both lawyers,
    even though the suggestions were not entirely favourable to him personally.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The part of his testimony that concerned
    specifically the incident of December 7, 2011, is clearly confirmed by other
    witnesses that testified concerning that incident. Yes, there are some
    discrepancies between the witnesses, especially Mr. [Dickson] and Mr. Vibe’s
    explanation as to how they ended up at the principal’s office. However, the
    testimony of the five Crown witnesses on this incident i[s] generally
    consistent.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Finally, simply because there are
    inconsistencies between Ms. Sands and Zack Vibe does not mean that Zack Vibe is
    not a credible witness. It is simply possible that Ms. Sands herself
    misunderstood what was explained to her, or simply got it wrong. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, I accept Zack Vibe’s evidence and
    find his evidence to be credible and reliable. I also accept the Crown’s
    submission that the time of the offence is not an essential element that the
    Crown must establish as provided by the Supreme Court of Canada decision [<em>R.
    v. B.(G.)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>]</span></em> [1990] 2.

    some voices behind her: those of two young girls and an older man, who was
    encouraging the girls to make taunts and who himself was making suggestions
    that there was something dirty and disgusting nearby. He was swearing, saying
    “fucking dirty” and “take a look at that”. Ms. Lamontagne thought there might
    be some dirt on her coat and asked C.S.T. whether there was. C.S.T. said “no,

    appellant was walking behind them with some girls. She heard the appellant make
    comments about something smelling like fish and that someone needed to clean
    something up that was dirty. Ms. Harkness did not know if the comments were

    parking lot, Ms. Brown was in a group with the appellant walking behind C.S.T.
    and her party. The appellant said, “What’s that smell?” According to Ms. Brown,

    about took place in October 2012. She was 100% sure of that. Ms. Mason
    testified that she sat with the appellant during that particular football game
    but did not hear the appellant make any remark to C.S.T. She did see C.S.T. and
    her friends, including Desiree Brown, passing back and forth at the bottom of the

    grounds of appeal</span> </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>Grounds relating to the assessment of the
    evidence</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The appellant submits that the trial judge made several errors in
    his assessment of the evidence upon which he based the convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>First, the appellant </span><span lang=EN-GB>submits that Penny
    Mason’s evidence about events at the football game provided some
    con&#64257;rmation of Ms. Lamabe’s version of events and ought to have been
    considered in determining the weight to be placed on Ms. Lamabe’s evidence on
    this point. Although not amounting to direct corroboration, Ms. Mason’s
    evidence lent support to what Jodi Lamabe recounted that C.S.T. said and did
    before the contact she alleged with the appellant. Ms. Mason’s evidence
    provided comfort that Ms. Lamabe’s narrative of the events could be trusted as
    providing insight into the dynamic between the appellant and C.S.T.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The trial judge found that Ms. Mason’s evidence had “very little to
    add to this matter” because she was adamant that the events about which she
    testified took place in October 2012, not October 2011, the date of the alleged
    offence. The trial judge did not misapprehend Ms. Mason’s evidence. Given Ms. Mason’s
    recollection of when the events she testified about occurred, her evidence
    could provide no confirmation of Ms. Lamabe’s evidence about a football game
    that took place a year before. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Second, the appellant argues that in light of the medical circumstances
    that led to the inability of Ms. Lamabe to complete her evidence, the trial
    judge should have considered whether Ms. Lamabe’s evidence on behalf of the
    defence raised a reasonable doubt. I disagree. As stated earlier, the trial
    judge adopted the defence position that although Ms. Lamabe’s evidence was
    admissible, its weight would depend on whether it was confirmed by other
    evidence. The trial judge applied this ruling to Ms. Lamabe’s evidence about
    the football game; that evidence was not confirmed by any other witness. The
    trial judge made no error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Third, t</span><span lang=EN-GB>he appellant submits that the trial
    judge’s differential treatment of the evidence led by the Crown and the defence
    is demonstrated by the way in which he looked to con&#64257;rmatory evidence of
    the December school incident to bolster Mr. Vibe‘s general credibility, while
    failing to look to other events to confirm Ms. Lamabe’s evidence. As stated,
    the trial judge adopted and followed the defence’s position regarding the
    assessment of Ms. Lamabe’s evidence. I give no effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Fourth, the appellant submits that the trial judge’s application of
    uneven scrutiny of the evidence is further shown by his reliance on C.S.T.’s
    demeanour to bolster her credibility, while at the same time ignoring the
    antagonistic nature of her cross-examination. Further, the trial judge made no
    mention of the fact that C.S.T. left the witness box during cross-examination,
    while at the same time being critical of Jodi Lamabe’s emotional response in
    doing the very same thing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>I am not persuaded by this submission for several reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge’s ultimate findings demonstrate
    that he critically examined all of the evidence in an even-handed fashion:
    while he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant made the
    statements alleged at the Halloween dance and football game, he could not reach
    a similar conclusion regarding the volleyball game in light of the
    inconsistencies of the various witnesses’ versions of events;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>His acceptance of C.S.T.’s evidence rested
    primarily on the confirmatory nature of the evidence given by other witnesses,
    especially that given by Desiree Brown concerning what happened on the way out
    to the parking lot after the football game. Ms. Brown was part of the group
    walking with the appellant; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-GB style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Although C.S.T. left for a while at the
    beginning of her cross-examination, she returned and continued to testify,
    unlike Ms. Lamabe. While it is apparent from the transcript that C.S.T. became
    frustrated with the repetitious defence questioning over minor differences
    between her testimony and her statement to the police, she ultimately completed
    her evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Fifth, and lastly, the appellant submits that the trial judge
    unfairly criticized Haley Holmes, the appellant’s daughter’s best friend, for
    her “self-serving&quot; memory. The trial judge’s characterization finds
    support in the record. I see no palpable and overriding error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Consequently, I would not give effect to any of these fact and
    credibility-related grounds of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>D.      </span><span class=Heading1Char>Legal
    error concerning the elements of criminal harassment</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The appellant was charged with one count of criminal harassment by
    way of repeated communications with C.S.T. causing her to fear for her safety
    contrary to ss. 264(1) and (2)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The appellant
    contends that in determining whether the charge was made out, the trial judge
    adverted to only two of the five constituent elements of the offence. His
    failure to consider all &#64257;ve elements was an error of law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>I am not persuaded by this submission. The elements of the offence
    are: (i) the accused engaged in the conduct set out in s. 264(2)(a), (b), (c),
    or (d); (ii) the complainant was harassed; (iii) the accused knew the
    complainant was harassed or was reckless or wilfully blind as to whether the
    complainant was harassed; (iv) the conduct caused the complainant to fear for
    her safety or the safety of anyone known to her; and (v) the complainant’s fear
    was, in all the circumstances, reasonable: <em>R. v. Kordrostami</em> (2000),
    47 O.R. (3d) 788 (C.A.), at para. 8. The jurisprudence considers a complainant
    as being in a harassed state when by reason of the conduct the complainant
    feels “tormented, troubled, worried continually or chronically, plagued,
    bedeviled and badgered”: <em>R. v. Kosikar</em> (1999), 178 D.L.R. (4th) 238
    (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (2000) 142 C.C.C. (3d) vi, at
    para. 25. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>A fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons and the evidence
    demonstrates that all of the elements of the offence were established. The
    trial judge expressly found that the appellant communicated repeatedly with
    C.S.T. and those communications made her fearful. The trial judge accepted
    C.S.T.’s evidence that the appellant almost hit her with his car, a sufficient
    basis in itself to find that C.S.T.’s fear of the appellant was reasonable. And
    the evidence left no doubt that C.S.T. felt harassed and the appellant, at a
    minimum, was reckless or wilfully blind as to whether she was harassed.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>By way of summary, I am not persuaded that the trial judge’s reasons
    were insufficient, demonstrated an uneven scrutiny of the evidence or failed to
    apply the principles in <em>W.D</em>. He provided lengthy reasons, which
    explained in detail the basis for his findings. As my review above of the trial
    judge’s assessment of the credibility issues discloses, I see no uneven
    scrutiny of the evidence on his part. Finally, he expressly self-instructed on
    the principles in <em>W.D.</em> and I see no misapplication of those
    principles.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
