  <p class=Heard>Heard: April 11, 2019</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Mark L. Edwards of
    the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 13, 2018, with reasons reported at
    2018 ONSC 3150, 47 C.C.E.L. (4th) 228.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Pardu J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, Ms. Taafe, appeals from a
    judgment awarding damages for breach of contract and for malicious prosecution
    in favour of the respondent, Ms. Curley. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant alleges that the trial judge erred
    in three respects:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By failing to recognize that in the absence of
    any evidence from police about the effect of the appellant’s complaint to them
    upon their investigation, he could not conclude that the appellant initiated a
    criminal prosecution of the respondent, in light of the other evidence that
    showed that the police did in fact conduct an independent investigation of
    their own.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By applying the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn </i>(1893),
    6 R. 67 (U.K. H.L.)<i> </i>to discount evidence supporting the appellant’s
    position and undermining the respondent’s position. The appellant submits that
    the application of the rule to a letter written by the respondent, which had
    the potential to significantly impact the trial judge’s assessment of the
    parties’ credibility, was flawed given that the appellant’s trial counsel
    referred to the letter in her opening statement at trial and provided an
    opportunity for the respondent to explain the contents of the letter during
    cross-examination. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By taking judicial notice of the effect of a
    criminal charge on a paralegal’s practice, and upon the respondent’s ability to
    mitigate her damages for breach of contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would give effect to each of these arguments,
    allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below, and dismiss the action.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Factual issues</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant is a lawyer. She had a referral
    contract with the respondent, who was working as a paralegal, albeit unlicensed
    by the Law Society. The respondent promised to refer clients exclusively to the
    appellant for real estate and family law matters. The respondent would do
    paralegal type work on the files. An associated confidentiality agreement
    between the parties specifically provided that “confidential information”
    contained within the files was the property of the appellant. Any work done on
    any file that contained confidential information, including without limitation
    notes, financial information, or any text from which confidential information
    could implicitly be understood, was deemed to be confidential information. The
    file contents were to remain the sole property of the appellant, and the
    agreement provided that “confidential information (including any reproduction
    therefore) shall remain the sole property of TAAFE LAW and shall be returned to
    TAAFE LAW immediately upon request or immediately after the termination of the
    employee’s employment, for any reason.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the agreement was for a one year term,
    the relationship fell apart earlier for widely divergent reasons given by each
    of the parties. The appellant testified that she terminated the relationship on
    January 15, 2013 because of complaints from clients, and after determining that
    the respondent was not a qualified law clerk or paralegal. The appellant also
    pointed to a letter, dated January 15, 2013, which she says confirms an
    in-person discussion in which she terminated the respondent. The respondent
    testified that she did not receive the aforementioned letter. The respondent
    testified that she knew by February 19, 2013 that the appellant had terminated
    the arrangement but took the position that the appellant had breached the
    contract between them by unilaterally terminating it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified that she asked the
    respondent to return all of her client files to her home on January 15, 2013.
    She says the respondent did come to her home that day but did not leave the
    files.  The respondent testified that she went to the appellant’s home, on her
    own initiative, only to leave closed files there. According to her evidence,
    she did keep two files, the “M” file and the “S,” file in her possession. The
    appellant also claimed to have sent a letter to the respondent on February 12,
    2013, in which she alleged she would go to the police if she did not get her
    client files back. The respondent testified that she did not receive the
    February 12, 2013 letter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was divergent evidence about what, if any,
    communications passed between the parties after January 15, 2013. As has
    already been mentioned, the appellant claimed to have sent letters to the
    respondent on January 15, 2013 and February 12, 2013. The respondent maintained
    that she did not receive these letters. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified that she was worried
    about retrieving her client files. She said she called the Law Society and that
    they advised her to contact the police. On February 27, 2013, the appellant
    wrote to the police to complain that the respondent had not returned her client
    files after the termination of their contractual arrangement. She related that the
    respondent had come to her home on January 15, 2013 but that no files were
    left. She related efforts to retrieve the files by email communications. She also
    related that the respondent denied taking the files and said she had left them
    on the table in her kitchen. The appellant said she reviewed security camera
    footage that showed the respondent entering her home carrying orange folders
    used for her client files, and leaving the home, still carrying those files. The
    appellant asserted ownership of the files, and said she did not know why the
    respondent would not return the files, despite numerous attempts to obtain
    their return. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 2, 2013, an officer went to the
    respondent’s home. The officer showed the respondent a list of seven files the
    appellant wanted. The respondent provided the officer with two files, the “M”
    and the “S” files. The officer showed the respondent the security camera images
    capturing her arrival and departure from the appellant’s home. The officer did
    not lay any charges at this time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On April 30, 2013, the appellant forwarded to the
    police a letter sent to her by the respondent dated April 23, 2013. In that
    letter the respondent demands payment of an outstanding invoice, and describes
    at length, her side of the dispute with the appellant. Further, the respondent
    threatens the appellant with multiple courses of action she proposes to take. Notably,
    in the letter, she says the following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Now Ms. Taafe, please do not take this as a
    threat but merely an outline of my intentions regarding this matter.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>If I don’t receive my payment in full as set
    out in my Invoice of March 2<sup>nd</sup> 2013 including interest, by May 1,
    2013, I will proceed to package up any and all files/documents here in my
    office that relate to your clients and forward same detailing [<i>sic</i>] the
    matter at hand to the Law Society of Upper Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Simply put, make
    the payment and I will consider all matters settle [<i>sic</i>] in full. <u>Please
    do not send anyone to pick-up any documents or files</u> unless they have
    certified funds payable to Trinity Legal Services in the full amount as set out
    in my invoice of March 2, 2013. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following this apparent admission that the
    respondent still had possession of files belonging to the appellant, police
    charged her with theft under $5000 and possession of stolen property under
    $5000. Those charges were ultimately withdrawn. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After these charges were laid, the appellant
    testified that she learned the respondent was altering her letterhead, and
    using it without her consent. On the other hand, the respondent testified that
    she had the appellant’s authorization to use her letterhead, so that the
    appellant would not be bothered by real estate clients about work to be handled
    by the respondent as a paralegal. The appellant expressed concern she might be
    liable to phantom clients of whom she was unaware. According to her evidence
    she contacted the Law Society and on their advice spoke to the police. Charges
    of fraud under $5000 and forgery were laid against the respondent, but these
    charges were also ultimately withdrawn by the Crown. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial judge’s reasons</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge was scathing in his assessment
    of the appellant’s credibility, and accepted the respondent’s evidence. He
    found that the appellant did not terminate her business relationship with the
    respondent on January 15, 2013, but continued working with her, and that the
    respondent’s possession of the client files and use of the letterhead in
    January and February 2013 was accordingly with the appellant’s consent: </span><em>Curley
    v. Taafe</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2018 ONSC 3150, 47 C.C.E.L. (4th) 228, at
    paras. 68, 72. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge, at para. 67, cited the elements
    identified by Simmons J.A. in </span><em>Pate v. Galway-Cavendish</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2011 ONCA 329, 342 D.L.R. (4th) 632, at paras. 51-53, leave to
    appeal refused, [2011] S.C.C.A. No. 293 [</span><em>Pate I</em><span
lang=EN-US>] relating to when a defendant in a malicious prosecution action can
    be said to have initiated a prosecution:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>1. Did the defendant knowingly withhold
    exculpatory information from the police?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>2. Did the conduct of the defendant undermine
    the independence of the police investigation?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>3. Did the defendant communicate to police in
    a manner that misled the officers into not conducting an independent
    investigation?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>4. Did the
    defendant undermine the independence of the decision making process to lay
    charges and prosecute?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the appellant made
    misleading statements to police and withheld exculpatory evidence, specifically
    the video surveillance tape from which the still photos were extracted and
    turned over to the police: </span><em>Curley</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 68.
    The misleading statements were the statements that the appellant ended the
    contractual relationship on January 15, 2013 and that the respondent was not
    authorized to use the appellant’s letterhead at the relevant time. Based on the
    evidence before him, the trial judge found these statements to be untrue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, although no testimonial evidence was elicited
    from any police officer who swore the informations laying the charges, or from
    any investigating officer, the trial judge concluded that had police known of
    the true state of affairs, the first information would never have been laid: </span><em>Curley</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 45. Pursuant to </span><em>Browne v. Dunn</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span lang=EN-US> he refused to give any
    weight to the respondent’s letter of April 23, 2013 in which she seemingly
    acknowledged possession of the appellant’s files at a time when she conceded
    the contractual relationship was over. The trial judge reasoned that because
    the appellant’s counsel did not cross-examine the respondent about the specific
    parts of her own letter in which she appeared to acknowledge possession of the
    appellant’s files, he was only left to speculate as to what the respondent
    meant in the relevant extracts from her letter: </span><em>Curley</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 43. He awarded general damages of $50,000 and punitive
    damages of $25,000 on the malicious prosecution claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also awarded $7,500 to the
    respondent for the appellant’s wrongful termination of their contract,
    reflecting the continued earnings the respondent would have accumulated from
    her relationship with the appellant for the rest of the contractual term. It so
    happened that the respondent started work for a credit union on January 21,

    earnings from that source in excess of her earnings as a paralegal pursuant to
    the contract. The trial judge noted, at para. 76, that the respondent also
    received an $85,000 settlement from the credit union as compensation for her termination
    from that position in June 2013. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The suggestion
    that the Plaintiff could mitigate her damages by referring other real estate
    transactions to other lawyers in Durham, has to be viewed in the context that

    having to deal with the criminal justice system for the first time, would find
    that experience a difficult one that might otherwise impact on one’s ability to
    work. In my view, an appropriate award with respect to the Plaintiff’s claim
    for breach of contract is an amount of $7,500.</span></p>

    observed that the bar is set very high in a claim of malicious prosecution and

    is in the public interest that this be the case because criminal prosecutions
    are brought not for the benefit of the prosecutor nor for the benefit of the
    complainant but rather for the common welfare of society. Second, because the
    standard of proof is very high in a criminal prosecution, there will be many
    prosecutions brought that do not succeed not because the charge is unfounded
    but because the standard of proof has not been met. That the threshold for
    success is high in an action of malicious prosecution therefore balances the
    public interest in bringing to justice persons who may have broken the law

    written complaint by the appellant, dated February 27, 2013, laid out the
    appellant’s position and made note of the respondent’s competing version of the
    events. Police visited the respondent on March 2, 2013, and after listening to
    what she had to say and collecting two files from her, elected not to lay
    charges. The police decided to lay charges only after reviewing the
    respondent’s letter of April 23, 2013, describing a litany of complaints she
    had against the appellant, and after speaking to her about the missing files. The
    police exercised their discretion, firstly not to lay charges, and later, after
    hearing both sides and drawing their own factual inferences, to lay the
    charges. This is not a case where it was impossible for the police to exercise
    any independent discretion or judgment. As is evidenced by the aforementioned

    regarding the sequence of investigatory events and the absence of any evidence
    from the police as to the effect of the appellant’s complaint on their

    the complainant, they would not have charged the plaintiff: at paras. 37-42,
    51, 78-79. In upholding the trial judge’s conclusion that the Township was
    liable for malicious prosecution, this court reasoned that the “element of initiation

    The application of that rule is generally restricted to situations where a
    party cross-examining a witness called by the opposite side is planning on
    adducing contradictory evidence to impeach the witness’s credibility. The
    cross-examiner must “put” the contradictory evidence to the witness to allow
    the witness to provide an explanation for it: <i>R. v. Quansah</i>, 2015 ONCA

    [2016] S.C.C.A. No. 203. The rule reflects fairness to the witness whose
    credibility is attacked and to the party whose witness is impeached. It
    “prevents the ‘ambush’ of a witness by not giving him an opportunity to state
    his position with respect to later evidence which contradicts him on an essential
    matter”: <i>R. v. Verney </i>(1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 363 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 376,

  <p class=CQuote>In the present case, there was no
    element of the kind of unfairness or surprise that the rule in <i>Browne v.

    appellants came in the form of the appellants’ own affidavits. Moreover, at the
    beginning of the cross-examination the appellants were asked whether there was

lang=EN-US> Lauwers J.A. continued to analyze the other three factors that
    Simmons J.A. identified in <i>Pate I</i> relating to when a defendant in a
    malicious prosecution action can be said to have initiated a prosecution
    (whether the conduct of the defendant undermined the independence of the police
    investigation; whether the defendant communicated to police in a manner that
    misled the officers into not conducting an independent investigation and;
    whether the defendant undermined the independence of the decision making
    process to lay charges and prosecute). </span></p>
