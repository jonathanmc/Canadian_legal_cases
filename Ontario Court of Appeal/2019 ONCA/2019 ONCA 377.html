class=MsoPageNumber>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant was found guilty of one
    count of sexual assault and one count of sexual interference, contrary to ss.
    271 and 151 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span class=MsoPageNumber>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The trial judge entered a conviction for sexual
    interference, and conditionally stayed the sexual assault count. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant challenged his conviction
    on the basis of alleged errors in the trial judge’s reasons. At the conclusion
    of the oral hearing, the appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered, with
    reasons to follow. These are those reasons. As I will explain below, the trial
    judge erred in dealing with the issue of whether the complainant had a motive
    to fabricate the allegation against the appellant.</span></p>
  <h1><span class=MsoPageNumber>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>factual overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The events giving rise to this case
    occurred in the 2002-2003 school year. The appellant, who was 41-42 years old at
    the time, was employed as a Special Needs Assistant at the complainant’s middle
    school. The complainant was 12-13 years old and in grade 7. The complainant did
    not require any special assistance. However, he saw the appellant at the school
    on a daily basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant alleged a single
    incident of touching. He testified that it happened before a gym class. After
    changing into his athletic clothing, the complainant made his way from the
    change room to the gym via a space described at trial as a vestibule or short
    hallway. This is where he encountered the appellant. The complainant believed
    that he was the last student to leave the change room on the day of the
    incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant had his back to the door
    leading from the hallway to the gym, which would have prevented anyone from
    coming in from the gym. According to the complainant, the appellant asked him
    about his genital area, but the complainant could not remember exactly what the
    appellant said. The complainant stated that the appellant touched his penis
    under his shorts or pants for about five seconds. He was not sure whether it
    was also inside his underwear. The appellant said something reassuring
    afterwards, but the complainant could not remember exactly what was said. The complainant
    continued on his way into the gym. The incident left him feeling very confused.
    Nothing like this ever happened again.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant testified that he saw the
    complainant at school about four times a day. The complainant and other
    students would sometimes come to him with their problems. The appellant stated
    that he had a good relationship with the complainant. He denied touching the complainant
    in the manner that the complainant described, and denied stopping him to
    inquire about his genitals.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The trial judge accepted the complainant’s
    evidence. She rejected the appellant’s evidence. She was satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the incident described by the complainant happened. In reaching
    these conclusions, the trial judge relied on “evidence of an absence of motive”
    on the complainant’s part to fabricate the allegation.</span></p>
  <h1><span class=MsoPageNumber>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>issues on appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant advanced two grounds of
    appeal. First, he submitted that the trial judge erred in finding that the
    complainant had no motive to falsely accuse him. Second, the appellant argued
    that the trial judge held the appellant’s evidence to a higher standard of
    scrutiny than she held the complainant’s testimony to. The respondent contended
    that the trial judge made neither error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>As discussed below, I agree with the
    appellant that the trial judge erred in concluding that there was a proved
    absence of motive. This conclusion impacted the trial judge’s assessment of the
    complainant’s credibility, which was a central issue in the case. I would set
    aside the conviction and order a new trial on this basis alone.</span></p>

    it is necessary to delve further into the record. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant described his
    relationship with the appellant as “good” at the time the incident occurred.
    The complainant denied that he ever had an argument or dispute with the
    appellant. He looked up to the appellant and felt comfortable speaking to him,
    describing him as a mentor. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The appellant agreed that he had a
    “good relationship” with the complainant. He could not recall any problems
    between the two of them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant testified that, in the
    years following 2002-2003, he saw the appellant from time to time, at a plaza
    that was close to the school. They engaged in small talk. The appellant could
    not recall any such interactions with the complainant outside of school.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The complainant insisted that he did
    not regard the incident as a “big deal”. Indeed, he did not consider it to be
    sexual at the time it happened. He made no complaint to his parents, to school
    authorities, or to the police. The allegation came to light after the police
    contacted the complainant in September of 2016. This information came from a
    single answer from the complainant, elicited by the Crown (not Mr. Tatum)
    during examination-in-chief. It was not pursued further at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>During closing submissions, defence
    counsel (not Mr. Burgess) acknowledged that the complainant appeared to harbour
    no bad feelings toward the appellant, such that revenge was an unlikely motive.
    However, she pointed out that there are “many reasons” why someone may
    fabricate an allegation, reasons that may never come to light. Asked by the
    trial judge to give some examples, defence counsel suggested financial gain.
    When asked if there was a financial motive in this case, defence counsel
    responded: “Well, I don’t know Your Honour, which is really my point.” When
    further challenged on the point, defence counsel submitted that “what you have
    here at most…is an absence of evidence of motive.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The Crown acknowledged that there was
    no onus on the appellant to establish a motive. However, he referred to the
    defence submission that there was merely an absence of evidence of motive and
    said, “[t]hat’s not what we have here”, suggesting that a lack of motive was
    proven on the evidence. He submitted that it was a “very, very important fact
    to consider when examining the credibility of a witness”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The trial judge agreed with the Crown’s
    approach. She twice mentioned in her reasons for judgment that the complainant had
    no motive to fabricate the allegation. When first addressing the issue, the
    trial judge said: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>The defence has no onus to point to a
    motive to fabricate. The onus in a criminal prosecution always rests upon the
    Crown. However, at the same time, an absence of motive can be relevant in
    assessing the credibility of a witness. In this regard, I find the evidence of
    both witnesses indicate that the nature of the relationship was such that M.K. [the
    complainant] did not have a motive, either back in 2002-2003 or in 2016-2017 to
    make up this allegation against [the appellant]. <u>In addition, as noted
    earlier, M.K. did not go to the police, they called him.</u> </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>I find there is evidence of an absence of motive which is
    relevant in assessing M.K.’s credibility</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in her reasons, the trial judge addressed the question of motive again: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>While it is very important to remember that there is no onus on
    the defence to establish a motive, <u>the defence did make submissions about
    M.K. having a possible monetary motive and that there are many reasons people
    lie. A money motive was never put to M.K. in cross-examination.</u></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The absence of any evidence of a financial motive to lie is
    therefore noted in the context of this defence submission and should be
    considered in relation to the earlier remarks in this decision in relation to
    motive. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
class=MsoPageNumber>I agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred by
    transforming the absence of evidence of a motive to fabricate into a proven
    lack of motive, contrary to this court’s decision in </span><em>R. v. L.L.</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>, 2009 ONCA 413, 96 O.R. (3d) 412.</span> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal
    trials are often concerned with issues of human motivation. The issue of motive
    may arise in different contexts. While not an essential element of an offence,
    the Crown may sometimes rely on motive as circumstantial evidence of guilt to
    prove identity and/or intent: see <em>Lewis v. The Queen</em>, [1979] 2 S.C.R.
    821, at pp. 833-838; and <em>R. v. Griffin</em>, 2009 SCC 28, [2009] 2 S.C.R.
    42, at para. 60. In this context, the cases underscore the “significant
    difference” between absence of proved motive and proved absence of motive: <em>R.
    v. White</em> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.), at p. 608, aff’d [1998] 2 S.C.R.
    72, at para. 59.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    ulterior motive, or a motive to fabricate, on the part of a complainant may be
    equally important. From the defence perspective, proof of such a motive
    provides a compelling alternative to the truth of the allegations. From a
    prosecutor’s point of view, a proved absence of motive to fabricate provides a
    powerful platform to assert that the complainant must be telling the truth. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    problems occur when the evidence is unclear – where there is no apparent motive
    to fabricate, but the evidence falls short of actually proving absence of motive.
    In these circumstances, it is dangerous and impermissible to move from an
    apparent lack of motive to the conclusion that the complainant must be telling
    the truth. People may accuse others of committing a crime for reasons that may
    never be known, or for no reason at all: see <em>R. v. J.V.</em>, 2015 ONCJ
    815, at para. 132; <em>R. v. Sanchez</em>, 2017 ONCA 994, at para. 25; <i>L.L.</i>,
    at para. 53; <em>R. v. T.G.</em>, 2018 ONSC 3847, at para. 30; <em>R. v. Lynch</em>,
    2017 ONSC 1198, at paras. 11-12.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    in this context too, there is a “significant difference” between absence of
    proved motive and proved absence of motive: <em>L.L.</em>, at para. 44, fn. 3. The
    reasons are clear. In <em>R. v. B. (R.W.) </em>(1993), 24 B.C.A.C. 1 (C.A.),
    Rowles J.A. explained, at para. 28: “it does not logically follow that because
    there is no apparent reason for a motive to lie, the witness must be telling
    the truth.” This point was made in <em>L.L.</em>, in which Simmons J.A. said, at
    para. 44: “the fact that a complainant has no <u>apparent</u> motive to
    fabricate does not mean that the complainant has no motive to fabricate” (emphasis
    added). See also <em>R. v. O.M.</em>, 2014 ONCA 503, 313 C.C.C. (3d) 5, at
    paras. 104-109; and <em>R. v. John</em>, 2017 ONCA 622, 350 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at
    para. 93.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the Crown at trial (and on appeal) relied on the uncontradicted
    evidence of a good relationship between the complainant and the appellant. However,
    this evidence must be placed in context. In describing his attitude toward the
    appellant, the complainant largely referenced their relationship in 2002-2003,
    roughly 15 years before the trial. The evidence of more recent interactions
    (i.e., at the plaza) was of limited value. According to the complainant, the
    last time such an interaction occurred was three years before the trial. The
    appellant could not recall any such interactions. It was clear that, by the
    time of trial, there was no relationship between the complainant and the
    appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, evidence of a good relationship between the complainant and the
    appellant was not capable of proving that the complainant had no motive to
    fabricate; it could do no more than support the conclusion of an absence of
    evidence of a proved motive: <em>White</em>, at p. 608; <em>L.L</em><i>.</i>,
    at para. 45; <em>John</em>, at para. 94. This state of affairs was not capable
    of enhancing the complainant’s credibility, as the trial judge did. At best, it
    was a neutral factor.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s error was compounded when she addressed the issue for a second
    time, in the passage reproduced above, in para. 18 of these reasons. The
    defence did not suggest that the complainant had a financial motive to falsely
    accuse the appellant, as the trial judge suggested. When defence counsel
    submitted that a witness may fabricate for “many reasons”, a financial motive
    was offered as a generic example. Defence counsel did not advance a specific
    allegation of a financial motive in this case. This explains why the suggestion
    was not put to the complainant in cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the trial judge’s reliance on the fact that the complainant was contacted by
    the police (instead of the opposite) was misplaced. The Crown elicited this
    information at the end of the complainant’s examination-in-chief. The issue was
    not pursued by defence counsel, for good reason. The evidence was prejudicial,
    suggesting that “where there’s smoke there’s fire”. It should not have been
    admitted. Moreover, it does not necessarily follow that being contacted by the
    police is inconsistent with a motive to fabricate. It certainly does not
    constitute evidence capable of establishing a lack of motive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, I am satisfied that the trial judge’s findings on the issue of
    motive formed an important part of her credibility assessment of the
    complainant. She used her finding of a proved absence of motive to enhance the
    credibility of the complainant, which was a central issue at trial. This amounted
    to a miscarriage of justice warranting a new trial. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Uneven Scrutiny</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    that there must be a new trial, it is not necessary to address the uneven
    scrutiny issue in any detail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Mr. Burgess acknowledged in his oral submissions, this is a difficult ground
    upon which to succeed. This steep incline is reflected in numerous decisions
    from this court: see e.g., <em>R. v. Gravesande</em>, 2015 ONCA 774, 128 O.R.
    (3d) 111, at paras. 18-20; <em>R. v. Chanmany</em>, 2016 ONCA 576, 352 O.A.C. 121,
    at paras. 26-28, leave to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 88; <em>R. v.
    Kiss</em>, 2018 ONCA 184, at para. 83; <em>R. v. Polanco</em>, 2018 ONCA 444,
    at para. 33, leave to appeal refused, [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 271; and<i> <em>R. v.
    D.E.S.</em></i>, 2018 ONCA 1046, at paras. 15-16. The appellant must be able to
    point to something in the reasons or the record that suggests that differential
    standards of scrutiny were applied. This ground of appeal is not meant to be a
    vehicle for re-trying the credibility findings in an appellate court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that the trial judge may have found more aspects of the appellant’s
    testimony problematic when compared with the complainant’s account. However,
    this ground of appeal does not invite a quantitative analysis. Instead, this
    court will review the reasons as a whole to determine whether the trial judge
    approached the evidence with an open mind and dealt with conflicting accounts or
    inconsistencies in the evidence of both parties fairly. Standing alone, being
    disbelieved does not translate into uneven scrutiny. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge seized on numerous factors in the evidence of both witnesses,
    relating to events that happened 15 years earlier. An important factor in this
    analysis was that the complainant was a child at that time of the alleged
    incident. As the trial judge observed, as an adult witness testifying about
    childhood events, the complainant’s credibility should be assessed according to
    criteria applicable to adult witnesses, but “the presence of inconsistencies,
    particularly as to peripheral matters such as time and location, should be
    considered in the context of the age of the witness at the time of the events”:
    see <em>R. v. W.(R.)</em>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 134. The trial judge’s
    reasons reflect this differential approach to the evidence of the complainant
    and the appellant. This factor goes a long way in explaining her assessments of
    their credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>conclusion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    mentioned at the beginning of these reasons, the appeal was allowed at the end
    of the oral hearing. The conviction on the sexual interference count was set
    aside, the conditional stay on the sexual assault count was lifted, and a new
    trial was ordered on both counts.</p>
