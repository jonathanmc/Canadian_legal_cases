    with reasons reported at 2018 ONSC 4797.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants are the owners of several hookah lounges located within
    the Regional Municipality of Peel. In their lounges, the appellants supply
    waterpipes and smoking products (including herbal shisha, a legal substance) to
    their customers to be consumed on site, while the customers socialize on their
    premises. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 28, 2016, the<span lang=EN-US> Region passed by-law No. 30-2016, </span><em>Peel Waterpipe Smoking By-law</em><span lang=EN-US> (“the By-law”), which,
    among other things, prohibits smoking waterpipes in </span>specified places
    that would include the appellants’ lounges<span lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants applied under s. 273 of the <em>Municipal Act, 2001</em>,
    S.O. 2001, c. 25, for a declaration that ss. 2(a), (b), and (c) as well as s. 5
    of the By-law are illegal and should be quashed. Sections 2(a), (b) and (c) prohibit
    waterpipe smoking in<span lang=EN-US> an enclosed public place, an </span>enclosed
    workplace and a restaurant or a bar patio. Section 5 prohibits a proprietor, an
    employer, or an employee from permitting waterpipe smoking in the locations
    specified in ss. 2(a), (b) and (c). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants argued that the Region acted outside the scope of its
    powers because the By-law targeted their businesses and would ultimately result
    in closure of their lounges and substantial economic loss. They maintained that
    the Region does not have the power to prohibit a business. Further, they argued
    that the By-law is inconsistent with provincial legislation and that the
    Region, though purportedly acting to protect employees, failed to consult with
    hookah lounge employees, and therefore acted in bad faith. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge dismissed the appellants’
    application. In his view, most of the issues raised had been canvassed in a
    case involving a City of Toronto by-law prohibiting waterpipe smoking in
    premises Toronto had licensed to carry on business. The challenged by-law was
    held valid and that decision was upheld by this court: </span><em>2326169
    Ontario Inc. v. Toronto (City)</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2016 ONSC 6221, 59 MPLR
    (5th) 279, aff’d 2017 ONCA 484, 67 MPLR (5th) 183 (“the City of Toronto case”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the application judge found that
    the </span><em>Municipal Act 2001</em><span lang=EN-US> conferred powers on the
    Region resembling the powers conferred on Toronto under the </span><em>City of
    Toronto Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, S.O. 2006, c. 11. Similar to the conclusion
    reached in the City of Toronto case, the application judge found there was
    ample evidence to support the conclusion that “the purpose of the By-law was protection
    of public health and safety, which is a purpose specifically authorized by
    section 11(2) subparagraph 6 of the </span><em>Municipal Act, 2001</em><span
lang=EN-US>.” Further, relying in part on the City of Toronto case, the application
    judge concluded that the By-law did not conflict with the </span><em>Occupational
    Health and Safety Act</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (“the </span><em>OHSA</em><span
lang=EN-US>”), contrary to what the applicants had argued. Finally, he found diligent
    and thorough levels of consultation, research, and inquiry by the Region and no
    evidence of malicious or purposeful conduct in failing to consult the
    appellants’ employees. He rejected the appellants’ claim of bad faith.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge therefore dismissed the
    application with costs to the Region on a partial indemnity basis, totaling
    $86,580.99.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants raise three issues on appeal and seek
    leave to appeal costs. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal and
    deny leave to appeal costs.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Discussion</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-US>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge did not err in failing to
    find the By-law <i>ultra vires </i>the Region</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellants submit that the
    application judge erred in failing to find the By-law </span><em>ultra vires</em><span
lang=EN-US> the Region. They say he erred in law in characterizing the subject
    matter of the By-law as the protection of public health and safety when the
    sole effect of the By-law was to prohibit their businesses. The appellants say
    that, on the record before council, waterpipe smoking was occurring in only 24
    enclosed public places, all of which were waterpipe establishments. On these
    facts, the sole purpose of the By-law could only have been to prohibit the
    appellants’ businesses. The appellants submit that the </span><em>Municipal Act,
    2001</em><span lang=EN-US> does not grant municipalities the power to prohibit
    businesses and that the By-law was therefore beyond the Region’s powers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, the appellants argue that the
    application judge erred in law in relying on the City of Toronto case for the
    broad proposition set out at para. 84 of his reasons that it was unnecessary to
    consider “the ultimate effect of the By-Law on the economic interest of the
    applicants … when determining whether the By-Law was lawfully enacted having
    regard to its purpose.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants rely on this court’s decision in </span><em>Canada
    Post Corp. v. Hamilton (City)</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2016 ONCA 767, 134 O.R.
    (3d) 502, as establishing that it is necessary to consider not only the
    purpose, but also the effects of a by-law to determine if it is <i>intra vires</i>.
    They contend that the application judge erred in distinguishing </span><em>Canada
    Post Corp.</em><span lang=EN-US> on the basis that the primary issues in that
    case were constitutional law issues, including conflict between federal and
    provincial legislation as well as the doctrine of paramountcy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not accept these submissions. The broad
    statutory authority conferred on the Region and the evidentiary record in this
    case amply support the application judge’s conclusions that the purpose of the
    By-law was to protect public health and safety, a purpose authorized by s.
    11(2)(6) of the </span><em>Municipal Act, 2001</em><span lang=EN-US>, and that
    the By-law is therefore </span><em>intra vires</em><span lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 8(1) of the </span><em>Municipal Act,
    2001</em><span lang=EN-US> requires that the powers of a municipality under the
    act “be interpreted broadly so as to confer broad authority on the municipality
    to enable the municipality to govern its affairs as it considers appropriate
    and to enhance the municipality’s ability to respond to municipal issues.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section 11(2) of the </span><em>Municipal Act,
    2001</em><span lang=EN-US> permits a municipality to pass by-laws respecting
    specified “matters”. Subparagraph 6 of s. 11(2) specifies one such matter as:
    “Health, safety and well-being of persons.” Section 8(3)(a) of the </span><em>Municipal
    Act, 2001</em><span lang=EN-US> provides that a by-law under s. 11 respecting a
    matter may “regulate or prohibit respecting the matter”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As in the City of Toronto case, in determining
    the purpose of the By-law, the application judge reviewed the process that led
    to its enactment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In particular, the application judge noted that
    concerns had been raised relating to the harmful effects of waterpipe use by
    the Public Health Division of the Region’s Health Services Department (“Peel
    Public Health”) in a 2012 report entitled “Burden of Tobacco: the Use and
    Consequences of Tobacco in Peel”. Subsequently, in February 2015, Peel Public
    Health issued a further report entitled “Health Effects from the Uses of, and
    Exposure to, Tobacco and Non-tobacco Waterpipes”. The latter report included
    various recommendations, such as the possible development of a by-law
    prohibiting waterpipe smoking in enclosed public spaces and workplaces,
    including restaurants and bar patios.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, as the result of a November 2015 report
    from the Medical Officer of Health and the Commissioner of Health Services, the
    Region conducted stakeholder consultations with a view to determining how the
    Region could best address public health risks associated with waterpipe smoking
    in public places. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following these consultations, in April 2016,
    the Medical Officer of Health and the Commissioner of Health Services submitted
    a report to council concerning the consultations, in which they recommended the
    enactment of a by-law prohibiting waterpipe smoking of both tobacco and
    non-tobacco products in enclosed public places, enclosed workplaces, and
    specified outdoor locations within the Region. After hearing submissions and
    receiving delegations relating to the recommendations in the April 2016 report,
    the Region enacted the By-law at the April 28, 2016 council meeting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Based on the evidence concerning this process as
    well as evidence concerning certain testing that had been conducted at
    waterpipe establishments, the application judge concluded that there was no
    evidence to support the submission that the purpose of the By-law was to
    prohibit business. He stated, “[i]ts true purpose was to prohibit a specific
    activity, namely smoking with waterpipes on the grounds that it posed a risk to
    public health and safety.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While cognizant of the appellants’ evidence of
    the potential economic impact of the By-law on their businesses, the
    application judge concluded that, just as this court held in the City of
    Toronto case, “that [potential impact on the operation of the appellants’
    businesses] is only an unfortunate incidental result of the By-law and not
    determinative of its purpose.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent disputes the appellants’
    submissions concerning whether </span><em>Canada Post Corp.</em><span
lang=EN-US> requires a court to consider the effects of a By-law when assessing
    whether the By-law is </span><em>ultra vires</em><span lang=EN-US>. Like the
    application judge, the respondent relies on the fact that the primary issues in
    the </span><em>Canada Post Corp.</em><span lang=EN-US> case involved questions
    of constitutional law in order to distinguish it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are skeptical of the application judge’s view
    that this court’s discussion of </span><em>vires</em><span lang=EN-US> in </span><em>Canada
    Post Corp.</em><span lang=EN-US> can be distinguished only because, overall,
    that case addressed conflict between federal and provincial law and paramountcy.
    However, it is unnecessary that we determine that question for the purposes of
    this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Assuming the effects of a by-law may be relevant
    to determining its purpose – or the “matter” of the by-law – we see no error in
    the conclusion that, on the facts of this case, the potential economic impact
    on the appellants’ businesses is but an unfortunate incidental result of the

    entirely in keeping with the application judge’s finding that the true purpose
    of the By-law was to protect public health and safety from the risks posed by
    waterpipe smoking, a purpose authorized under s. 11(2) of the </span><em>Municipal
    Act, 2001</em><span lang=EN-US>. Considering the By-law as a whole, we agree
    with the application judge’s conclusion that, as in the City of Toronto case,
    while the By-law may have an economic impact on the operation of the
    appellants’ businesses, that is only an unfortunate incidental result of the
    By-law and not determinative of its purpose.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants’ second argument is that the
    application judge erred in failing to find that the By-law conflicts with the </span><em>OHSA</em><span
lang=EN-US>. They rely on </span><em>Control of Exposure to Biological or
    Chemical Agents</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 833 (“Regulation
    833”), which was made under the </span><em>OHSA</em><span lang=EN-US>. The
    appellants contend that Regulation 833 comprehensively addresses the protection
    of Ontario workers from hazardous agents in the workplace, including carbon
    dioxide and particulate matter, the substances identified by the Region as
    posing a danger in this case. They say that, under s. 2(2) of the </span><em>OHSA</em><span
lang=EN-US>, Regulation 833 prevails over the By-law and the By-law is
    therefore void.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> In the alternative, they say the By-law is incompatible with the purpose of
    Regulation 833 and is therefore void under s. 14 of the </span><em>Municipal
    Act, 2001</em><span lang=EN-US>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Finally, the appellants contend that the application judge erred in relying on
    this court’s rejection of a similar argument in the City of Toronto case. That
    is because, say the appellants, the City of Toronto case focused only on the </span><em>OHSA</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>itself and did not address the appellants’ arguments
    concerning conflict with Regulation 833. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reject these submissions. In the City of
    Toronto case, this court noted that the by-law at issue in that case
    “protect[ed] the health and safety of patrons as well as employees of
    businesses.” Further, this court found the by-law at issue “complementary to
    both the purpose and the provisions of the </span><em>OHSA</em><span
lang=EN-US>.” Importantly, this court concluded, “[c]ontrary to the appellants’
    submission, <u>the <i>OHSA</i> does not require the City to adopt measures
    short of a prohibition on hookah smoking</u> in order to protect employment in
    hookah lounges” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants have identified nothing in
    Regulation 833 that suggests this court’s conclusions concerning conflict with
    the </span><em>OHSA</em><span lang=EN-US> are not equally applicable to it. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-US>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge did not err in failing to
    find the Region acted in bad faith</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants’ third argument is that the
    application judge erred in failing to find that the Region acted in bad faith
    in enacting the By-law. The appellants contend that bad faith in this context
    does not require wrongdoing or personal advantage to a member of council. All
    that is required is that a municipality act arbitrarily and without the
    required degree of fairness, openness, and impartiality. The appellants submit
    that because their employees’ economic interests were affected by the By-law,
    the employees were entitled, as a matter of procedural fairness, to be
    consulted concerning its impact. Further, the appellants point to the application
    judge’s statement in his reasons that “[m]ere inadvertence of council to invite
    employees does not make out bad faith”. They submit that the reason for a
    denial of procedural fairness is immaterial to the issue of bad faith. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not accept the appellants’ submissions. As
    we have said, the application judge found that the record disclosed “very
    diligent and thorough levels of inquiry, research and consultation by the
    Region prior to the enactment of the subject By-Law.” He noted that a public
    meeting was held to allow members of the public and stakeholders to make their
    concerns known to the Regional council. His comment about inadvertence was made
    in the context of observing that it was open to the appellants’ employees to
    attend the public meeting. In the circumstances, we see no basis on which to
    interfere with the motion judge’s finding that the appellants failed to meet
    the heavy burden of establishing the presence of bad faith in the enactment of
    the By-law. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge denied the Region’s
    request for substantial indemnity costs. He also reduced its claim for partial
    indemnity costs by $10,000 by eliminating the claimed junior counsel fee,
    resulting in a total costs award of $86,580.99 on a partial indemnity basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reject the appellants’ argument that the
    application judge should have followed the lead of the application judge in the
    City of Toronto case and made no order as to costs. The issues raised in this
    case bore substantial similarity to the issues already fully litigated in the
    City of Toronto case. As such, this case did not raise a matter of first
    impression and the appellants had no reason to expect that the Region’s
    taxpayers should bear the burden of the appellants’ legal challenge. </span></p>
