  <p>On appeal from the convictions entered by Justice John P.
    Condon of the Ontario Court of Justice on November 17, 2016.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, R.M., was charged with ten offences arising from his
    domestic relationship with C.G. He was convicted of five of those offences,
    including: three charges of assault contrary to <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46, s. 266, a charge of sexual assault contrary to <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    s. 271, and a charge of unlawful confinement contrary to <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    s. 279(2). He was acquitted of four of those offences, including: another
    charge of unlawful confinement for which no evidence was led, a charge of assault,
    a charge of assault with a weapon contrary to <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 267(a),
    and a charge of aggravated assault contrary to <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 268.
    The remaining charge of uttering a death threat contrary to <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    s. 264.1(1)(a) was withdrawn by the Crown with leave of the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result of his convictions, R.M. was sentenced to 21 months in jail
    and placed on probation for three years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.M. now appeals his convictions. He claims that the trial judge erred
    in rejecting his <em>Charter</em>, s. 11(b) motion and failing to stay the
    charges, and that he committed several legal errors related to credibility
    evaluation when finding R.M. guilty of the five offences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept R.M.’s grounds of conviction appeal, and dismiss his
    sentence appeal as abandoned.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE TRIAL JUDGE WAS CORRECT IN REJECTING THE S. 11(b)
    APPLICATION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his s. 11(b) analysis, the trial judge proceeded on the basis that
    the total period of delay ended with his s. 11(b) decision. However, the
    parties have argued this appeal on the basis that the period of total delay
    should have ended with R.M’s conviction. Absent the benefit of complete
    argument, this is not the case to tackle the controversial questions relating
    to the proper end point in calculating total delay.  Nor would that
    determination affect the outcome of the instant appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If we proceed on the basis that the appeal was argued – that the total
    delay was 650 days, or 21 months and 11 days – the remaining delay is
    presumptively reasonable. We can explain this conclusion by examining only
    three of the periods of delay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.M. takes issue with the trial judge’s decision to deduct 71 days, or 2
    months and 11 days, of delay on the basis that this delay arose from exceptional
    circumstances. Even if the trial judge was incorrect about this, he also found
    that R.M.’s counsel made “an explicit waiver of the adjournment time arising
    from the discre[te] event.” This finding was not challenged by R.M. This waiver
    means that the entire period is defence delay that must be deducted from the
    total delay. This brings the remaining delay down to 579 days, or 19 months and
    9 days.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also attributed significant delay to R.M. for inaction
    in arranging a pretrial. In this appeal, R.M. contends that much of this delay
    should not have been laid at his feet, but concedes that 35 days of that delay
    is properly attributable to the defence. This was a proper concession. This 35
    day delay was caused by R.M.’s counsel being double booked for a pretrial and
    then seeking an adjournment to permit R.M. to obtain legal aid. Without
    resolving the controversy concerning the remaining portion of delay, this
    concession brings the remaining delay down to 544 days, or 18 months and 4
    days.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among the other periods of delay deducted, the trial judge found that 14
    days of defence delay was caused when an adjournment was required because R.M.
    needed time to consider his election on mode of trial. R.M. does not contest
    this conclusion. This brings the remaining period of delay under 18 months,
    making the delay presumptively reasonable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.M.
    does not urge that in this case the presumptively reasonable delay should be
    found to be unreasonable. On this basis alone, R.M.’s s. 11(b) appeal would fail,
    without having to consider the other periods of delay that are in dispute
    between the parties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, regardless of how the total delay is calculated – whether until the
    end of the verdict or until the end of the s. 11(b) decision, or even until R.M.
    was sentenced just a month or so after the s. 11(b) decision – the remaining
    delay would not be unreasonable in this transitional case. The trial judge made
    factual determinations that have not been effectively challenged and that make
    this outcome inevitable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically,
    the trial judge found that by the time <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27,
    [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631<em> </em>was decided, all of the evidence in the case had
    been heard. The next appearance date for reply evidence and submissions was
    already set and there was no opportunity for the Crown to remedy that delay. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    also found that the parties relied on the law as it existed prior to <em>Jordan</em> and that the defence never demonstrated concern about the delay that was
    occurring. This was a decision that was open to the trial judge to make on the
    facts of this case, given the various adjournment requests made, the defence inaction
    in setting the pretrial, and the failure of R.M. to be ready to elect mode of
    trial. R.M.’s counsel’s sole relevant comment when setting trial dates, that he
    had “many many early dates”, is not enough to undercut the trial judge’s
    finding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Against
    this backdrop, the trial judge appropriately invoked the transitional exception
    in a serious case where he found, as he was entitled to, that no meaningful
    case specific prejudice had been demonstrated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    same conclusion applies in this case, however total delay is calculated. The s.
    11(b) appeal is therefore denied.</p>
  <p class=Heading>THERE ARE NO ERRORS IN THE SUBSTANTIVE JUDGEMENT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his factum, R.M. raised three grounds of appeal relating to the trial judge’s
    decision to find him guilty of the five charges: (1) the trial judge erred by
    using the complainant’s admission of lying to bolster her credibility, (2) the
    trial judge erred by failing to explain why adverse credibility findings he
    made against the complainant on some of the counts did not undermine her
    credibility on the balance of the counts, and (3) the trial judge applied
    stricter scrutiny to R.M.’s evidence than the complainant’s evidence,
    undermining the fairness and appearance of fairness of the trial. These
    arguments were each presented in oral argument, although structured
    differently. Mindful of the overlap between them, we will address the arguments
    in the order just identified.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Trial Judge did not use the Complainant’s lie to bolster her
    crediblity</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge did not use the complainant’s admission that she lied
    about the aggravated assault incident to bolster her credibility. Instead, he
    used her readiness to admit having lied as an illustration of his conclusion
    that she was responsive to questions. Specifically, he said in the impugned
    passage that “[s]he was responsive to the questions put to her, even agreeing
    that she had lied to some people about events that had occurred”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    rather than using the complainant’s admission to having lied to bolster her credibility,
    the trial judge found that the inconsistency between her statements and her
    testimony contributed to the reasonable doubt he had on the aggravated assault
    charge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.M.
    argues in the alternative that this latter finding is inconsistent with the former.
    Specifically, R.M. contends that when the trial judge found the complainant’s admissions
    that she lied to be responsive, he must implicitly have accepted that she actually
    was lying when making those prior statements. In other words, he must have accepted
    that her earlier claims that R.M. had not caused her injury were in fact false.
    Yet, the trial judge then relied on the inconsistency between those innocent
    accounts and her incriminating testimony as a reason for reasonably doubting
    her incriminating testimony. The two findings cannot co-exist, logically.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. Recognizing an answer to be responsive does not require acceptance
    that the responsive answer is true. And that is all that the trial judge used
    her admission to lying to demonstrate - responsiveness. We cannot infer that
    the trial judge committed the error in logic that R.M. alleges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, even if the trial judge had accepted the complainant’s evidence that
    she was lying when she provided the innocent accounts, and avoided the logical
    error R.M. now raises, it would have worked against R.M.’s case. Consistent use
    of a finding that the complainant was lying when making the prior inconsistent
    statements would neutralize those prior inconsistent statements, thereby strengthening
    the Crown case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows in our view that even had the trial judge reasoned as R.M. alleges, the
    logical error would not be a material legal error undercutting the trial
    judge’s findings, nor would it be the basis for a finding that a miscarriage of
    justice has occurred. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the trial judge did not err by failing to explain why his credibility
    concerns on some counts did not undercut his findings on other counts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.M.
    argues that the trial judge’s decision to acquit R.M. of several of the charges
    reflects concerns he had about the complainant’s credibility. R.M. says that
    the trial judge erred by not considering these problems with the complainant’s
    evidence in convicting R.M. of the other charges, and in not explaining why
    these concerns did not raise a reasonable doubt on the other charges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this argument would have more currency if the trial judge had
    affirmatively found that the complainant was lying in her evidence at trial
    about any one of the charges. He did not go that far. He went no farther than
    to identify credibility concerns that contributed to the reasonable doubt he
    had on some of the allegations. This is not a case where the trial judge chose
    to believe a demonstrated liar on some counts, without explanation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    course, we do agree that it would have been better had the trial judge been
    explicit about why the credibility concerns he had about some of the
    complainant’s testimony did not undercut the testimony she gave that he did accept.
    It is nonetheless apparent from the trial judge’s decision as a whole that he
    did not silo his credibility findings from count to count. He opened his
    judgment with general assessments of the credibility of R.M. and the
    complainant. For each of the counts on which he convicted R.M., he gave context
    specific reasons for crediting the complainant, in addition to observations he
    made about the manner in which she testified, the detail she offered on central
    and incidental details, and the fact that she avoided difficulty in
    cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    two of the assault convictions, the trial judge found that photos of injuries
    confirmed her accounts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the conviction for unlawful confinement, the trial judge found that the
    strikingly similar and overlapping details between the complainant’s narrative
    and the testimony of R.M., relating to an incident with a vacuum chord and a wicker
    or willow chair, supported her evidence that this actually happened, a point we
    address in more detail below. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the findings of guilt involving an assault by slap and then a sexual assault,
    the trial judge found the complainant’s evidence to be particularly credible
    because of her candid admissions. She testified that she agreed with R.M. the
    unwanted anal sex was “good for her”, and that despite her lack of consent she
    let him proceed. As it happens, actual consent or mistaken belief in consent did
    not become issues in the case because the only defence raised was denial so
    these admissions by her did not ultimately weaken the Crown case. However the
    trial judge was impressed by, among other things, the candour of her account,
    as he was entitled to be. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    it was open to the trial judge to believe only some of the complainant’s
    evidence. In doing so, he explained why. We would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the trial judge did not use Uneven Scrutiny in evaluating the evidence
    of r.m. and the complainant</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>R.M.
    seeks to make out this notoriously difficult ground of appeal by challenging
    several of the trial judge’s damaging factual findings. He urges that the trial
    judge made a series of discrete reasoning errors in salvaging the complainant’s
    evidence – including some of the findings we have just described. He says that
    when the two approaches are contrasted, uneven scrutiny becomes clear.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. We begin with the most obvious observation. The trial judge
    approached the evidence of both witnesses critically. He rejected some of the
    testimony of each of them, and acted on other evidence each gave. This alone
    does not undercut this ground of appeal, but it does place it on a less stable
    foundation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, in our view the trial judge was quite entitled, on the evidence
    before him, to: (1) make the inferences he did in rejecting R.M.’s story about
    the vacuum chord incident; (2) find inconsistency in R.M.’s evidence about his
    physical capabilities, and (3) accept that the photos depicted the alleged
    injuries. These findings were derived from reasonable inferences that logically
    arose from the evidence in the case and do not demonstrate a pattern of easy
    rejection of R.M.’s case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do agree that the trial judge should not have relied upon R.M.’s testimony
    about the complainant’s request for anal sex on another occasion, and about her
    urinary incontinence, as illustrations of R.M. discrediting himself by taking
    advantage of opportunities to make “extraneous” negative or embarrassing
    comments about the complainant. His testimony about the anal sex and the
    urinary incontinence was prompted by direct (if not perplexing and even
    inadmissible) questioning by defence counsel. It is therefore unfair to blame
    R.M. for the answers he gave, or to call his answers “extraneous”. Nonetheless,
    in our view these improper illustrations are harmless, because the underlying
    conclusion is unassailable. A review of R.M.’s evidence shows that he was indeed
    anxious to place the complainant in a negative light. The animus he showed did
    discredit him. Ultimately, the fact that the trial judge took the wrong path to
    a correct conclusion does not illustrate the intense and inappropriate scrutiny
    of his evidence that R.M. alleges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did the trial judge make the errors alleged in crediting the complainant. He
    did rely on her demeanour in giving evidence, but as already indicated, there
    were case specific reasons for accepting her evidence on the charges that
    resulted in findings of guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is there any evident inconsistency in the complainant’s account of how she came
    to be tied up. The trial judge was entitled to proceed on the footing that she
    was grabbed while standing, but then tied up while sitting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge should not have used the term “corroborated” in finding support in
    the strikingly similar details between the complainant’s incriminating account
    and R.M.’s exculpatory version of the unlawful confinement allegation. However,
    the trial judge was entitled to note that those overlapping peculiar features,
    which would not likely have been remembered by R.M. had the incident been as
    innocent as he claimed, provided support for the complainant’s version. She
    described a peculiar method of confinement in a woven wooden chair with a
    vacuum chord. So too did R.M. His evidence confirmed her testimony about his
    access to the tools she said he used in confining her. As well, when R.M.
    testified that he only threatened to restrain the complainant with a vacuum
    chord on the woven wooden chair, his argument about the implausibility of actually
    confining her in this way was compromised.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we do not agree that the trial judge erred by enhancing the complainant’s
    credibility because she admitted “difficult facts”. This case is not like <em>R.
    v. Kiss</em>, 2018 ONCA 184, at para. 107. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There,
    the complainant admitted to factual circumstances that supported the accused’s
    innocent narrative of events, but were inconsistent with her incriminating version.
    The error the trial judge made in <em>Kiss </em>was to credit the complainant
    with candour in making such admissions, but then disregard the fact that her
    admissions damaged her version of events. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the “difficult facts” the complainant admitted are entirely consistent with the
    complainant’s narrative of being anally penetrated after saying no, but then
    participating in order to avoid further assault or injury and not confronting R.M.
    with the fact that she had not consented. While her co-operation with the anal
    sex and her agreement that it was “good for her” may have challenged the Crown
    in overcoming a defence claim of consent, or a defence of belief in consent had
    one been raised, the defence here was denial. The admitted facts were not
    “difficult facts”, because they did not weigh either against the Crown’s case,
    or in favour of R.M.’s case. There was no misuse of those facts by the trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is there anything to the argument that the trial judge used R.M.’s “difficult”
    admission – that he had threatened the complainant with a vacuum chord and a
    woven wooden chair – to reject his account and support conviction, while using the
    complainant’s “difficult” admissions to accept her account and support
    conviction. As indicated, her admissions were not “difficult”, but consistent
    with her allegation. R.M.’s admission was not “difficult” either. He told an exculpatory
    story about the vacuum chord and the chair, not as an admission, but in a failed
    effort to tell the “real story” to cast doubt on her incriminating version. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge’s reasoning does not show uneven scrutiny.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
