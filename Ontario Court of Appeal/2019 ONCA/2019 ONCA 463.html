  <p class=Heard>Heard: April 30, 2019</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the
    convictions entered by Justice Jennifer Woollcombe of the Superior Court of
    Justice, sitting with a jury, on October 1, 2015, and from the sentence imposed
    on February 10, 2016, with reasons reported at 2016 ONSC 1039.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Pardu J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the hearing of this appeal, the appellant did
    not pursue the conviction appeal and it was dismissed. The appellant’s sentence
    appeal was reserved. For the reasons that follow, the sentence appeal is also
    dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was sentenced to 15 years in
    custody less credit for 200 days presentence custody for importing heroin, and
    conspiracy to import heroin. The sentence was broken down as 15 years for the
    conspiracy count, and 12 years concurrent for the importation count.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The count charging conspiracy alleged that the
    appellant conspired to import heroin between October 15, 2010 and March 25,
    2011. The substantive importation count charged her with importing heroin into
    Canada on or about March 24, 2011. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>factual overview and the sentencing judge’s
    reasons</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The seriousness of the offence and nature of the
    conspiracy </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge concluded that she was
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was part of a broad
    ongoing conspiracy to import heroin, extending beyond the importation of March
    24, 2011, evidenced by multiple other importations of heroin:</span><em> R v.
    Murororunkwere</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2016 ONSC 1039, at para. 14.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge found that the appellant
    recruited Ms. Mukandori to bring heroin from Nairobi in October 2010: </span><em>Murororunkwere</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 15-19. According to her evidence, Ms. Mukandori was
    outfitted with an undergarment designed to conceal drugs. The appellant was
    present for the fitting of this garment and according to Ms. Mukandori’s
    evidence, after the drugs were concealed in the undergarment, the appellant
    told her there was a kilogram of heroin in the garment and drove Ms. Mukandori
    to the airport to return to Canada. The sentencing judge, at paras. 17-18,
    referred to other evidence which in her view provided independent confirmation
    of this incriminatory evidence and supported her conclusion that the appellant
    conspired to import heroin into Canada in October 2010. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge also concluded that the
    appellant conspired with others to import heroin in January 2011: </span><em>Murororunkwere</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 28. The sentencing judge found that the appellant
    provided Ms. Kalimba with a plane ticket to travel to Mombasa so that she could
    return travel to Detroit with drugs. The sentencing judge accepted Ms.
    Mukandori’s testimony that the appellant told her Ms. Kalimba would also be
    importing drugs. In the same month, the appellant drove Ms. Mukandori to
    Nairobi where she met the same two men who had given her the special
    undergarment in the appellant’s presence. This time the men gave her hand
    luggage in which heroin was concealed and which Ms. Mukandori brought to
    Canada. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the sentencing judge concluded that the
    appellant conspired to import heroin in March 2011: </span><em>Murororunkwere</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 29-30. Ms. Mukandori was caught at the airport with 2.5 kilograms
    of heroin, worth between $200,000 and $750,600 at the time. The guilty verdict
    on the substantive count establishes that the appellant facilitated this
    importation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant had planned for Ms. Kalimba to
    bring drugs to Canada around the same time but abandoned those plans when Ms.
    Mukandori was apprehended at the airport.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge found that the appellant
    played a significant role in the conspiracy, well beyond that of a one-time
    courier, at para. 55 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>There
    is no doubt in my mind that Ms. Murororunkwere’s role was much more significant
    than that of a one-timer courier. She facilitated and arranged for two couriers
    to travel to three different African countries (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania) in
    order to bring heroin into Canada on four occasions and into the United States
    once. Twice, when the importation was into Canada, she organized for the heroin
    to be transported to the United States. She was an active participant in a
    sophisticated international drug importation scheme. I find that her
    culpability is high – much higher than that of a courier. Her sentence must
    reflect the very serious nature of her repeated conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown<span lang=EN-US> and defence counsel at trial agreed that a
    sentence of 12 to17 years would be fit for a first time importer of a large
    amount of heroin.  The Crown further submitted that if the sentencing judge
    found that Ms. Murororunkwere was a principal in multiple attempts to import
    and multiple successful importations, then the appropriate sentencing range
    would be 14 to 18 years. Defence counsel took the position that due to the
    unique and exceptional circumstances of the appellant, which I will discuss
    below, the broad sentencing range the court should consider is between 8 to 12
    years.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge concluded that the
    appellant’s culpability was more serious, as she had been part of a conspiracy
    to import heroin on multiple occasions and that the appropriate range of
    sentence for the offences committed by Ms. Murororunkwere was 14 to 18 years: </span><em>Murororunkwere</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 48, 55-56.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s personal history</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the sentencing hearing, the appellant tendered a letter written by her daughter
    describing horrific suffering the appellant endured during the Rwandan genocide
    in 1994 which the sentencing judge summarized at para. 32 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The
    letter from Ms. Murororunkwere’s daughter, Olga Kata, says that during the 1994
    Rwandan genocide, Ms.Murororunkwere was raped, and that she is a product of
    that rape. She says that her mother was kidnapped by people who killed members
    of her family. Counsel has elaborated his understanding of what happened to Ms.
    Murororunkwere. He tells the court that she is Tutsi and that Hutu soldiers
    killed her parents and brothers and that one of the soldiers took her from
    Rwanda through Zaire (now the DRC) to Uganda and then Kenya. He says she was
    effectively a “prisoner bride” and that she was beaten and tortured. She also
    became HIV positive. According to counsel, Ms. Murororunkwere was rescued by a
    neighbor in Kenya. She came to Canada as a refugee in 2003.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the sentencing hearing, defence counsel urged
    the court to conclude that the appellant’s personal history was so exceptional
    as to amount to extenuating circumstances justifying a sentence of not more than
    12 years. The sentencing judge did not accept this argument.  Citing </span><em>R.
    v. Shahnawaz </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(2000)</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, 51 O.R. (3d) 29 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2001] S.C.C.A.
    No. 24, she concluded that the horrific events occurring some 18 years ago
    could not justify a departure from the normal range of sentence in the absence
    of a link between the offender’s history and one of the relevant principles of
    sentencing: </span><em>Murororunkwere</em><span lang=EN-US>, at paras. 61-65. While
    the sentencing judge noted that there was a lack of evidence about the
    appellant’s personal history outside of the hearsay account provided by her
    daughter, she was prepared to accept the version of events between and
    following the 1994 Rwandan genocide for the purposes of sentencing:</span><em> Murororunkwere</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 65. She did conclude that the
    appellant’s past was, to some degree, a relevant and mitigating factor on
    sentencing: </span><em>Murororunkwere</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 67. </span></p>

    suggesting the sentencing judge erred by sentencing her as if she were a party
    to a broader conspiracy to import heroin. The trial Crown invited the jury to
    convict on two bases, either a narrow agreement related to the March 24, 2011
    importation or a broader agreement related to a series of importations
    suggesting an ongoing agreement to import heroin. Either basis was possible on
    the wording of the indictment. The guilty verdict on the conspiracy count did
    not reveal the basis upon which the jury convicted and the sentencing judge was
    obliged to come to her own independent determination of the facts relevant to
    sentencing: </span><em>R. v. Ferguson</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2008 SCC 6, [2008]

    accepted that the sentencing judge had to make this determination given the
    ambiguity of the jury’s finding of guilt on the conspiracy count. The Crown
    urged the court to conclude that the appellant conspired to import heroin from
    October 15, 2010 to March 25, 2011 and alleged that she was implicated in
    organizing a number of separate trips to Africa to facilitate importation of
    heroin as part of an ongoing scheme. Defence counsel urged the trial judge to
    conclude that only a narrower conspiracy related to the March 24, 2011
    importation was proven. </span></p>

    A review of the relevant case law shows that the role of the individual in a
    drug trafficking organization also can impact the measure of the gravity of the
    offence for the purposes of sentencing.  In both </span><em>Sidhu</em><span

    fact that a judge deviates from the proper sentencing range does not in itself

    The appellant’s essential submission is that the sentencing judge ought to have

    sentencing judge considered irrelevant matters or failed to consider relevant

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>To
    suggest that a trial judge commits an error in principle because in an

    discretion is all about. To maintain deference to the trial judge’s exercise of
    discretion, the weighing or balancing of relevant factors must be assessed
    against the reasonableness standard of review. Only if by emphasizing one
