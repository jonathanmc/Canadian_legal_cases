  <p class=Heardandreleasedorally>Heard: June 7, 2019 </p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on September 19,
    2017 by Justice Grant R. Dow of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without
    a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual interference, invitation to sexual
    touching and sexual assault arising out of three incidents involving the
    appellant’s step daughter, who was between 6 and 11 years of age at the time of
    the offences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that that
    the trial judge erred in relying on the consistency of the complainant’s
    allegations to undermine problems related to the manner and timing of
    disclosure. Second, the appellant argues that the trial judge applied an uneven
    standard of scrutiny to the evidence of the defence and the Crown. </p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The consistency of
    the allegations</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s argument that the trial judge’s reliance on the
    consistency of the complainant’s allegations amounts to oath helping must be
    rejected.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the impugned passage in his reasons, the trial judge states that any
    concern that the complainant’s mother’s inquiries of her raised a reasonable
    doubt was eliminated by the fact that the complainant had repeated her
    allegations to the police, the judge at the preliminary inquiry, and the trial
    judge over a three-year period, and that her evidence “has not wavered” as her
    appreciation of the importance of telling the truth would likely have grown.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Crown that the trial judge’s statement must be read in
    the context of the submissions from the parties and his reasons as a whole. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence was entitled to attack the complainant’s credibility,
    including various inconsistencies in her evidence. However, it was open to the
    trial judge to consider the whole of the evidence, including the complainant’s
    evidence following her initial disclosure and to whom it was made, in
    determining whether the manner of the complainant’s mother’s questioning of her
    prior to the allegations being made raised a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not use the complainant’s statements to bolster her
    credibility or to corroborate her in-court testimony. Rather, the trial judge considered,
    and rejected, the appellant’s contention at trial that the complainant’s
    evidence was unreliable because it was inconsistent; because of the circumstances
    in which it was disclosed following the complainant’s mother’s inquiries of her
    (specifically, asking whether the appellant had put his penis into her vagina);
    and because the complainant should have been a better witness because she was
    no longer a child. This was the context in which the trial judge referred to
    the complainant having maintained her complaint, reporting it not only to her
    mother but also to authority figures, despite her love for the appellant and
    absence of a motive to displease her mother. The unwavering nature of her
    evidence also rebutted the defence’s argument that she should be a better
    witness because she was 15 years old when she testified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, the trial judge’s credibility findings did not rest on
    the impermissible assumption that because the complainant had repeated her
    story, it was more likely to be true. Although the trial judge’s reasons could
    have been clearer in this regard, it is apparent that he was ultimately using
    the statements to provide context with which to assess the defence’s attack on
    the complaint’s reliability based on alleged inconsistencies: <em>R. v. O. (L.</em><i>)</i>,
    2015 ONCA 394, at paras. 34, 36; <em>R. v. J. (M.A.)</em>, 2015 ONCA 725, at
    para. 46.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence. The
    trial judge offered extensive reasons in support of his conclusion that the
    appellant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, reasons that are responsive to
    the record that was before him. The burden properly remained on the Crown
    throughout.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Uneven scrutiny of
    the evidence</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second ground of appeal must also be rejected. The appellant can point to
    nothing in the trial judge’s reasons or in the record that establishes that he applied
    different standards of scrutiny in assessing the evidence of the complainant
    and the appellant, nor can the appellant identify any palpable and overriding
    errors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s argument is, in essence, that the trial judge reached an unreasonable
    verdict by relying on irrelevant reasons to reject the appellant’s blanket
    denial of the offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although,
    read in isolation, some of the reasons cited by the trial judge for rejecting
    the appellant’s evidence may appear to be of questionable relevance, we accept
    the submission of the Crown that, read in the context of the record and the
    reasons as a whole, it is clear that the trial judge’s reasons for rejecting
    the appellant’s evidence are based on evidence that corroborates the
    complainant’s allegations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case turned on credibility. The trial judge did not believe the appellant’s
    denial that sexual contact occurred. This was a finding that was open to him on
    the record.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then concluded that the appellant’s testimony did not raise a reasonable
    doubt as to his guilt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s acceptance of the complainant’s evidence, which he found was
    corroborated by, among other things, evidence of the unusually close
    relationship between the appellant and the complainant, “clingy behaviour,” and
    physical contact including embracing, holding hands, and sitting on the
    appellant’s lap, necessarily entails the rejection of the appellant’s evidence,
    as in <em>R. v. J.J.R.D</em><span style='line-height:100%'>. (2006), 215 C.C.C.
    (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 53, leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No.
    69.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was entitled to believe the complainant, despite inconsistencies in
    her evidence. He reviewed her evidence thoroughly, in an age-sensitive manner,
    and explained why he accepted it. He properly took into account that her
    recollections began when she was a child and that she had a limited ability to
    recall some details and was uncomfortable discussing intimate sexual acts. As
    noted above, he also took into account the fact that the core allegations were
    maintained as the complainant, who was 15 years old at the time of trial, grew
    up. He acknowledged the inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony and
    found her credible nonetheless. There is no basis to impugn his decision to
    accept her evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
