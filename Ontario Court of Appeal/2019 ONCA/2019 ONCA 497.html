  <p class=Heading>Zarnett J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>Introduction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Individuals
    pursuing a lawsuit learn that evidence that might assist in proving their case
    has been destroyed. They start a second lawsuit against the insurance company
    they say should have preserved the evidence. The company alleges that any
    failure to preserve evidence is the result of faulty arrangements made by the
    plaintiffs’ lawyers. May the company bring third party proceedings for
    contribution and indemnity against the plaintiffs’ lawyers? That is the issue
    raised on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    plaintiffs, Ryan Hengeveld and his family, sued the appellant The Personal
    Insurance Company for failing to preserve the car that Mr. Hengeveld was
    driving when he was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. They allege
    this might impair their ability to prove their case in a separate personal
    injury action against those the Hengevelds allege caused the accident and
    injuries. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In response to the Hengevelds’ action against it Personal
    Insurance brought third party proceedings for contribution and indemnity against
    the Hengevelds’ lawyers,<span lang=EN-US> the respondents Mr. Virtue and Ms. El-Tawil,
    alleging they breached their duty to the Hengevelds to see that evidence
    necessary for their personal injury action was preserved.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The lawyers moved successfully to strike out the
    third party claim on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge held that because the allegations
    in the third party claim related to conduct falling within the scope of the lawyers’
    retainer by the Hengevelds, it was conduct that was attributable in law to the Hengevelds.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The lawyers’ alleged
    negligence could therefore be raised by Personal Insurance in its defence to
    the Hengevelds’ claim. The third party claim was unnecessary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Personal Insurance appeals. In my view the
    motion judge correctly concluded that the third party claim should be struck.
    Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The plaintiff Ryan Hengeveld was injured in a
    motor vehicle accident on January 27, 2014, while he was operating a Hyundai
    automobile insured by Personal Insurance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Hengeveld and his spouse, children and
    parents retained the respondent lawyers to act for them in connection with
    their damages arising out of the accident. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On January 6, 2016, the Hengevelds commenced the
    personal injury action for damages as a result of the injuries Mr. Hengeveld
    suffered in the accident. Personal Insurance is not a party to that action. The
    defendants to the personal injury action are the owner and operator of the
    other vehicle involved in the accident, the persons alleged to have been
    responsible for the safety and condition of the road where the accident
    occurred, the manufacturer of the Hyundai, and the dealership at which it was
    purchased.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 20, 2017, the Hengevelds commenced this
    action against Personal Insurance — the action out of which the third party
    claim and this appeal arise. The thrust of the Hengevelds’ claim is that Personal
    Insurance agreed, in 2014, to preserve the Hyundai in safe storage knowing it
    would be important to the resolution of liability issues in the personal injury
    action, but failed to do so. The Hengevelds allege that Personal Insurance
    disposed of the Hyundai, in breach of contract and/or negligently. They allege that
    this may impair their ability to prove liability against one or more of the defendants
    in the personal injury action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Personal Insurance defended. Its statement of defence asserts that, as
    insurer of the Hyundai, it fully indemnified the Hengevelds for the damage to
    the vehicle. In exchange, Personal Insurance became the owner of the Hyundai and
    was entitled to dispose of it for salvage. It denies that it had any obligation
    to preserve the Hyundai for any longer than it actually did, and states that
    “it was the [Hengevelds’] responsibility to secure and ensure the preservation
    of the vehicle as they intended to rely on it as evidence in [the personal
    injury action]”. The statement of defence alleges that the Hengevelds were
    negligent in failing to ensure the preservation of the Hyundai, failing to make
    adequate inquiries of Personal Insurance to confirm whether the Hyundai was
    being preserved, failing to make a valid contract with Personal Insurance for
    preservation of the Hyundai, and failing to send an expert to inspect the
    Hyundai in a timely manner, among other things. It is alleged that this caused
    or contributed to the Hengevelds’ damages; Personal Insurance pleads and relies
    upon the </span><em>Negligence</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><span lang=EN-US>,<i> </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. N.1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Personal Insurance then issued its third party claim against the lawyers.
    It claims contribution and indemnity from the lawyers for any amounts it must
    pay the Hengevelds.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The third party claim incorporates by reference Personal Insurance’s
    statement of defence, including the pleading of the </span><em>Negligence</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><span lang=EN-US>, and alleges that the lawyers were retained
    by the Hengevelds following the January 2014 accident to pursue the damages
    arising out of it, and that retainer included securing and preserving the
    evidence required to pursue the Hengevelds’ claims. It was the lawyers who
    contacted Personal Insurance in February 2014 about preserving the Hyundai, advising
    it that they had been retained by the Hengevelds; Personal Insurance told the lawyers
    where the Hyundai was so that it could be inspected, and the lawyers arranged
    an inspection in March 2014, but then secured no promises from Personal
    Insurance to keep the Hyundai. They also failed to arrange either to take possession
    of it themselves or for further inspection. Personal Insurance, having made no
    promises to preserve the Hyundai, sold it for salvage shortly after; it heard from
    the lawyers that they wanted another inspection some 19 months after the first
    inspection.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> The third party claim states that if Personal Insurance is found liable
    to the Hengevelds, the lawyers are liable for contribution and indemnity
    because they breached their duties to the Hengevelds as the Hengevelds’ lawyers.
    The particulars of the lawyers’ alleged negligence include failing to take
    adequate steps to ensure preservation of the Hyundai; failing to cause it to be
    inspected by an engineer or other expert in a timely way; and failing to
    communicate adequately with, make proper inquiries of, or establish a proper
    contract with Personal Insurance about the preservation of the Hyundai. The
    particulars of negligence asserted against the lawyers in the third party claim
    overlap significantly with the particulars of the Hengevelds’ negligence
    asserted in the statement of defence. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Motion Judge’s Decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The lawyers moved successfully under Rule 21.01(1)(b) of the </span><em>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, to strike out
    the third party claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The motion judge described the
    test for striking out a claim under that rule as whether it was plain and
    obvious that the third party claim was certain to fail, assuming the facts alleged
    in it to be true. He noted that this was not a case where Personal Insurance
    and the lawyers were both involved in the initial loss (by which he appears to
    have meant the motor vehicle accident of January 2014 that is the subject of
    the personal injury action). He held that, because the negligent acts and
    omissions alleged against the lawyers fell within the scope of their agency on
    behalf of the Hengevelds, they were not the proper subject of a third party
    claim: the Hengevelds would be responsible for anything done or not done by
    their lawyers acting as their agents. He stated, at para. 24: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In such situations where the plaintiff is
    responsible, Third Party Claims are unnecessary since the defendant could plead
    those matters in defence and, if the plaintiff was found at fault, damages
    would be reduced. Any neglect on part of the solicitors would be attributable
    to the plaintiff and make a third party proceeding unnecessary.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Appellant’s Position</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US> Personal Insurance argues that the motion judge erred in treating
    the initial loss as the January 2014 motor vehicle accident, and therefore in
    approaching the matter on the basis that Personal Insurance and the lawyers were
    not involved in the initial loss. Both Personal Insurance and the lawyers were
    involved in the loss complained of in the Hengevelds’ action against Personal
    Insurance, namely the disposal of the Hyundai and whatever detrimental effect
    that may have on the Hengevelds’ claim in the personal injury action. Personal
    Insurance submits that this is the relevant “initial loss”. Since its third
    party claim is not about the lawyers’ failure to assist the Hengevelds in
    mitigating their damages, this court’s decision in </span><em>478649 Ontario
    Ltd. v. Corcoran </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1994),</span></em> <span
lang=EN-US>20 O.R. (3d) 28, should have been applied for the proposition that, where
    the plaintiff’s lawyer and the defendant are both involved in the initial loss
    (that is, where it is alleged they each caused or contributed to the plaintiff’s
    initial loss) a defendant may take third party proceedings against the lawyer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Personal Insurance also argues that the cause of action underlying
    the Hengevelds’ claim against it is spoliation. Since that is a novel cause of
    action, matters related to it are not amenable to disposition on an r. 21
    motion.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, the resolution of the issue on this appeal does not turn
    upon what constitutes the “initial loss”. It turns upon whether the negligence
    alleged against the lawyers in the third party claim is attributable to the Hengevelds
    as plaintiffs. I begin by explaining why attributing the fault of a third party
    to a plaintiff matters to whether there is a cause of action by a defendant against
    that third party. I then discuss two situations in which the negligence of a plaintiff’s
    lawyer is attributable to the plaintiff. Finally, I discuss how those
    principles apply in this case.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Where Negligence of a Third Party is
    Attributable to the Plaintiff No Cause of Action for Contribution and Indemnity
    Exists Against That Third Party</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Rule 29.01(a) permits a defendant to commence a third party claim
    against any person not already a party to the action who “is or may be liable
    to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiff’s claim”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>A third party claim, like any action, must have a substantive
    component — it must assert a cause of action. Here the third party claim does
    not rely on any duty allegedly owed by the lawyers to Personal Insurance. It relies
    on the contribution and indemnity provisions of the </span><em>Negligence Act</em> <span lang=EN-US>(ss.&nbsp;1, 2 and&nbsp;5) to claim that the lawyers should be
    liable to Personal Insurance for all or part of the Hengevelds’ claim. But Personal
    Insurance also relies on the contributory negligence provision of the </span><em>Negligence
    Act</em> <span lang=EN-US>(s.&nbsp;3) to assert that the Hengevelds themselves
    are responsible for all or part of their own claimed damages. The interaction
    of those provisions is therefore important.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The </span><em>Negligence Act</em> <span lang=EN-US>provides, in s.
    1, that where damages have been caused or contributed to by the fault or
    neglect of two or more persons, each is jointly and severally liable to the
    plaintiff who has suffered those damages, but as between themselves “each is
    liable to make contribution and indemnify each other in the degree in which they
    are respectively found to be at fault or negligent.” Section 2 permits a
    defendant who has settled with the plaintiff for more than its proportionate
    share of the plaintiff’s damages to make a claim for contribution and indemnity
    against another person “</span>who is, or would if sued have been, liable” for
    those damages<span lang=EN-US>. Section 5 of the Act contemplates the situation where a defendant has been sued but
    believes there is another wrongdoer who caused or contributed to the plaintiff’s
    injury and has not yet been sued. It allows a defendant to pursue a right of
    contribution and indemnity against that person by third party claim, according
    to the rules of court for adding third parties.</span></p>

    the latter’s relative degree of fault: </span><em>Endean v. St. Joseph’s General

    reduced according to the plaintiff’s relative degree of fault. Under the </span><em>Negligence</em><i> <em>Act</em></i>’s <span lang=EN>contribution and indemnity provisions, a defendant

    injuries. But in order “to preclude the [defendant’s] attempt to assert a third-party

    will be obviated”, the plaintiff amended her statement of claim to specifically
    plead that her claim against the defendant was limited to the defendant’s
    proportionate share of fault: at paras.&nbsp;9-10. In the circumstances, it was

    defendant’s negligent conduct and to the distinct negligent conduct of other
    parties (i.e. negligent conduct that is distinct from the plaintiff’s negligent

lang=EN-US>In </span><em>Adams</em><span lang=EN-US>,<i> </i>property developers
    sued a firm of engineers alleging that their negligence in designing a

    proceedings against the plaintiffs’ lawyers alleging they had breached certain
    duties to the plaintiffs which, if fulfilled, would have allowed the plaintiffs
    to reduce the delays. In deciding the third party claim should be struck,
    McLachlin J.A. stated, at pp. 55-56: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>It thus may be stated with confidence, in my
    view, that a third party claim will not lie against another person with respect
    to an obligation belonging to the plaintiff which the defendant can raise
    directly against the plaintiff by way of defence. Where the only negligence
    alleged against the third party is attributable to the plaintiff, there is no
    need for third party proceedings since the defendant has his full remedy
    against the plaintiff. On the other hand, where the pleadings and the alleged
    facts raise the possibility of a claim against the third party for which the
    plaintiff may not be responsible, the third party claim should be allowed to
    stand.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Generally speaking, all acts falling within

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Another situation where a third party claim
    cannot be raised because the obligation is essentially that of the plaintiff is
    where the claim is one that the proposed third party should have advised or
    assisted the plaintiff to mitigate his damages. In that situation, like the
    situation of agency, third party proceedings are redundant because the
    defendant can obtain any relief to which he may be entitled by reduction of the
    plaintiff’s claim if he makes out the defence of failure to mitigate.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In my view, the agency situation described in <i>Adams</i> is also
    present in this case. Here, the Personal Insurance pleadings make clear that
    the retainer of the lawyers included taking steps, on behalf of the Hengevelds,
    to preserve evidence, and that the lawyers’ dealings with Personal Insurance — what
    they did and failed to do — were dealings undertaken on the Hengevelds’ behalf.
    Personal Insurance specifically pleads the scope of the lawyers’ agency as
    embracing the lawyers’ alleged negligent conduct. There is no pleaded
    negligence arising from acts outside of the lawyers’ retainer. Personal
    Insurance itself attributes the lawyers’ conduct to the Hengevelds by alleging that
    the Hengevelds were negligent in making and failing to make arrangements about
    the Hyundai’s preservation and inspection: arrangements they allege were
    actually made by the lawyers on the Hengevelds’ behalves. Nor have the Hengevelds

    was a situation of agency. Whether or not his comment about the initial loss
    was correct, it does not affect the result. Even if the initial loss for these
    purposes is the disposal of the Hyundai and the alleged negligence is that the respondent
    lawyers, acting as the Hengevelds’ agents, caused or contributed to that loss —
    the same loss that Personal Insurance allegedly caused or contributed to — that
    negligence (i) is attributable to the Hengevelds, (ii) may be raised (as it has

    Estate</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em><span lang=EN-US>the
    issue was whether a third party claim against the plaintiffs’ lawyers for
    failing to give proper advice<i> </i>concerning mitigation could give rise to a
    claim for contribution and indemnity under the </span><em>Negligence</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><span
lang=EN-US>. The court held that it could not. In that context, the court
    distinguished the situation where two wrongdoers are involved in causing or contributing
    to the plaintiff’s initial loss from </span>a claim of negligent advice resulting
    in a failure to mitigate<span lang=EN-US>, where the defendant who caused the
    initial loss wishes to third party the plaintiff’s lawyers on the basis that
    they failed to properly advise the plaintiff to minimize the loss <u>after</u> the initial loss was incurred. The court emphasized the importance of the
    distinction, at paras. 18-19:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>A plea of failure to mitigate is of an entirely different
    character. Such a plea arises after the loss has been suffered and relates to
    events or conduct unrelated to the cause of the initial loss. In my view, the
    defendant has no claim in law against the plaintiff’s solicitor for advice
    given to the plaintiff as to how to mitigate the loss caused by the defendant’s
    own wrong. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The <em>Negligence</em><i> <em>Act</em></i> does not diminish
    the amount that the plaintiff can recover from either wrongdoer on account of
    the fault of the other, but allows the wrongdoer named as a defendant to claim
    contribution by way of third party proceedings against the other wrongdoer
    based upon their respective degrees [of] fault. A plea that the plaintiff
    failed to mitigate is not embraced by [s. 1 of the <em>Negligence Act</em>]. It
    is a defence to the plaintiff’s initial claim that reduces the amount that the
    plaintiff may recover from the defendant by shifting some portion of the
    responsibility for the wrong to the plaintiff.</p>

    distinction was drawn between that type of claim and “claims for contribution

    giving rise to the initial loss and who is therefore jointly and severally
    liable with the defendant for the entire loss”: </span><em>Davy Estate</em><span

lang=EN-US>Finally, Personal Insurance argues that the foundation of the action
    against it is spoliation, a cause of action which has been described as not
    fully settled in the jurisprudence and not something which should be dealt with
    under r. 21: </span><em>Spasic Estate v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd</em><i><span
lang=EN-US>.</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (2000), </span>49 O.R. (3d) 699<span

    well-founded or novel the<b> </b><u>Hengevelds’</u> cause of action against Personal
    Insurance may be, <u>Personal Insurance’s ability to<b> </b>bring a third party
    claim</u> is foreclosed under fully established legal principles. It is plain
    and obvious that the third party claim discloses no reasonable cause of action —
    it has no reasonable prospect of success and was properly struck: </span><em>R.

    28, the court referred to the “obvious mischief” that could arise from allowing
    one party to sue another party’s lawyer. That concern will not prevail where
    the defendant has a valid legal claim against the lawyer. Here, for the
    foregoing reasons, there is no valid legal claim. The policy discouraging such
    mischief coincides with the result the law requires.</span></p>

    is also referred to as conduct that is “imputed” to the plaintiff: see David

    Rule 21.01(3)(d) as an abuse of process of the court. In light of the motion
    judge’s ruling that the third party claim should be struck as disclosing no
    reasonable cause of action under r. 20.01(1)(b), he concluded that it was not
    necessary to make a determination as to abuse of process.</p>

    about through a settlement in which a plaintiff agrees with the settling party
    that any negligence that would have been attributed to the settling party at
    trial will be attributed to the plaintiff. This can occur through a Pierringer agreement
    or order, which requires the plaintiff to restrict its claim to the damages
    arising from the allegedly negligent acts of the defendants who are <u>not</u> part of the settlement, among other things: see <span

    avoided by delegating them to another party such as its lawyers, including the
    duty to mitigate. Where the plaintiff did not fulfill its duty to mitigate its
    loss, that failure will be attributed to the plaintiff even if the failure was
    because it received poor advice about how to do so from its lawyers. Deficient
    advice about how to mitigate a loss cannot form the basis of a third party
    claim against the plaintiff’s lawyers by the party who caused the loss: </span><span
