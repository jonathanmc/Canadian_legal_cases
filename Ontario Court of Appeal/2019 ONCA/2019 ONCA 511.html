  <p class=MainParagraph style='line-height:150%'><b><span lang=EN-GB
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>I.        OVERVIEW</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In the early morning hours of September 8, 2015,
    the appellant, Scott Altiman, was driving on the streets of London, Ontario
    while heavily intoxicated. At the time, he was 31 years old. He ran a red light
    at a high rate of speed and collided with another vehicle. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The consequences to those in the other vehicle
    were horrific: the two passengers in the rear seat, Jerry Pitre (46 years old)
    and Cody Andrews (23 years old), were killed; the driver, Eric Allensen (25
    years old), suffered severe injuries, as did the other front seat passenger,
    his fiancé, Carlie Mathews (25 years old).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On June 8, 2017 Mr. Altiman pleaded guilty to:
    two counts of operating a motor vehicle while impaired
    and causing the death of another person contrary to the <em>Criminal Code</em> s. 255(3); two counts of criminal negligence causing death contrary to s. 220;
    two counts of operating a motor vehicle while impaired and causing bodily harm
    contrary to s. 255(2); and two counts of criminal negligence causing bodily
    harm contrary to s. 221.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At the time of the sentencing hearing, Mr.
    Altiman had been married to his wife for 14 years. They have three children, now
    ranging in age from 1 to 15 years old. Mr. Altiman is a member of the Walpole
    Island First Nation (Bkejwanong). The sentencing hearing was conducted in a <em>Gladue </em>court in London. Mr. Altiman was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The
    court also imposed a 15-year driving prohibition that ran from the date of
    sentencing, and victim surcharges totalling $1,600.00 on each count.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Crown concedes that in light of the decision
    of the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>R. v. Boudreault</em>, 2018 SCC 58, 369
    C.C.C. (3d) 358, the victim surcharges are no longer legal and must be removed
    from the sentence. Mr. Altiman does not take issue with the length of the
    driving prohibition imposed on him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Altiman seeks leave to appeal the custodial
    portion of his sentence. He advances two grounds of appeal: (i) in fashioning a
    fit sentence the sentencing judge failed to properly consider s. 718.2(e) of
    the </span><em><span style='color:windowtext'>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-GB> and the sentencing principles set down by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in </span><em><span style='color:windowtext'>R. v. Gladue</span></em><em>,</em><span
lang=EN-GB> [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, and </span><em><span style='color:windowtext'>R.
    v. Ipeelee</span></em><span lang=EN-GB>, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433; and
    (ii) the 10-year sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit, reflecting an absence
    of parity, proportionality, and restraint. Mr. Altiman submits that his
    sentence should be reduced to six years imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>For the reasons set out below, I would grant Mr.
    Altiman leave to appeal his custodial sentence and allow his appeal, reducing
    his custodial sentence from 10 years to seven years. Further, in order that the
    commencement date of the driving prohibition conforms to the requirements stipulated
    by the Supreme Court in </span><em>R. v. Lacasse</em><span lang=EN-GB>, 2015
    SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 109, yet remains consistent with the
    intention of the sentencing judge, I would vary the driving prohibition to eight
    years, to commence at the end of Mr. Altimans period of imprisonment. I would
    set aside the victim impact surcharges.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>II.       THE FACTS CONCERNING THE COLLISION</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>The events preceding Mr. Altiman entering his
    car</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In the four months preceding the collision, Mr.
    Altimans marriage had been under stress. Mr. Altiman had learned that his wife
    had been unfaithful with a man whom he knew through work. Mr. Altiman turned to
    alcohol as a &quot;band-aid&quot; to address the problems in his life,
    according to the <em>Gladue</em> report filed with the sentencing judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On September 7, 2015 Mr. Altiman attended a
    baseball game with his wife in London, Ontario. After the game, he went with
    others to a friend's home and later to a Legion Hall. He did not drive to
    either location. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At the Legion Hall, Mr. Altiman and his wife got
    into a heated argument. Sometime before 2:00 a.m., Mr. Altiman got into his
    2011 Dodge Charger and drove away.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>The agreed facts concerning the collision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>What happened next was described in an agreed
    statement of facts filed at the plea and sentencing hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Altiman drove his Charger northbound in the
    wrong (southbound) lanes of Highbury Avenue North. He approached the
    intersection just south of Huron Avenue where private driveways lead to two
    plazas: the Northland Plaza and the Huron Heights Plaza. A traffic signal
    controls the intersection with those private driveways. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Ms. Cassandra Nalty was sitting in her car
    stopped at the red light at the intersection waiting to exit the Huron Heights
    Plaza. When her light turned green, Ms. Nalty turned left to go southbound on
    Highbury Avenue, only to immediately find Mr. Altiman in her lane, heading
    northbound toward her. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Both Ms. Nalty and Mr. Altiman slammed on their
    brakes. Ms. Nalty swerved into the curb lane to avoid a collision. Mr. Altiman
    turned left into the Northland Plaza, drove through the plaza at a high rate of
    speed, before exiting right, on to Huron Street. He then turned right again to
    proceed southbound on Highbury Avenue, driving at a high rate of speed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>After narrowly avoiding a collision, Ms. Nalty
    continued southbound on Highbury Ave. As she approached a red light at the next
    main intersection at Oxford Street East, Ms. Nalty saw Mr. Altiman drive by her
    going southbound at a high rate of speed and then run the red light. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>While Mr. Altiman was driving southbound on
    Highbury Avenue towards the next main intersection at Dundas St., Mr. Allenson,
    with his passengers, was driving eastbound on Dundas St. in a Buick Grand
    National approaching the intersection with Highbury Avenue, where he stopped at
    a red light. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>When the light for Mr. Allensen turned green, he
    started to drive through the Highbury/Dundas intersection. At the same time,
    Mr. Altiman ran the red light at the intersection at a high rate of speed and
    smashed into the back half of the drivers side of Mr. Allensens car. The
    speed of Mr. Altimans car at the point of impact was 187 km/hr. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The force of the collision launched Mr.
    Allensens car into the air. The car flipped and spun until it landed, rolled,
    and slammed into a hydro pole on the southeast corner of the intersection. The
    impact was so forceful that the rear end of Mr. Allensens car was detached
    from the rest of the vehicle. The rear passenger seat was forced upwards and
    in, pushing the rear seat passengers, Mr. Pitre and Mr. Andrews, in the same
    direction through the rear window.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Pitre and Mr. Andrews landed in the
    northbound lanes of Highbury Avenue, just south of Dundas Street. They were
    treated at the scene by first responders but had no vital signs. Both were
    later pronounced dead at the hospital around 2:30 a.m. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Those in the front seats of the car, Mr. Allensen
    and Ms. Mathews, were still conscious in their vehicle when the first
    responders arrived. They survived the collision but sustained very serious
    injuries. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>After colliding with the Allensen car, Mr.
    Altiman kept driving southbound on Highbury Avenue. His car swerved left and
    right, mounted the median, struck a light standard, and ripped a road sign out
    of the median. The force of these impacts caused the drivers side front wheel
    to rip off. The car crashed into the front porch of 663 Highbury Avenue,
    causing some damage to the masonry and concrete steps, before slamming into the
    front porch of the adjacent house at 661 Highbury Avenue, causing significant damage
    to its masonry and concrete steps. The car finally came to rest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The front end of Mr. Altimans car was
    completely crushed. It caught fire. Firefighters ultimately used the Jaws of
    Life to extract Mr. Altiman from his car.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Police and firefighters at the scene detected
    the odour of an alcoholic beverage coming from Mr. Altiman. A police officer
    located an open tall can of beer on the passenger side floor, with
    approximately one-eighth of the contents remaining, as well as an empty glass
    bottle of light beer. Firefighters heard Mr. Altiman snore.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Analysis of blood samples seized from Mr.
    Altiman pursuant to a warrant revealed that at the time of the collision his
    blood alcohol concentration was 175 mgs/100 mls of blood. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>The impact of the collision on the victims
    and their families</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Numerous victim impact statements were placed
    before the sentencing judge from the surviving victims, as well as from the
    relatives and friends of all who were in the car. I can only refer to a few of
    them.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In his victim impact statement, Mr. Allensen,
    the driver of the car that Mr. Altiman split in two, described the four major
    surgeries he underwent, his inability to work, his feelings about almost losing
    his fiancé, Ms. Mathews, and the burdens assumed by his parents to care for
    him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Ms. Mathews described her life-threatening
    injuries; the 70 days she spent in the hospital, unable to walk; and her

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At the sentencing hearing were filed: an agreed
    statement of facts; victim impact statements; character references for Mr.
    Altiman; a lengthy <em>Gladue</em> report; a letter from Correctional Services
    Canada about the availability of healing lodges; and a letter of remorse from
    Mr. Altiman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge correctly identified the
    principles of denunciation and deterrence as the primary considerations in
    cases of impaired driving causing death: <em>R. v. McVeigh</em> (1985), 22
    C.C.C. (3d) 145 (Ont. C.A.); <em>R. v. Ramage</em>, 2010 ONCA 488, 257 C.C.C.
    (3d) 261, at para. 74. He observed that Mr. Altimans moral blameworthiness was
    high: [I]t was his choice to drink to excess and then drive a motor vehicle in
    the early morning hours when this event took place. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge then identified the
    mitigating and aggravating factors. The mitigating factors were: a guilty plea
    from day one; extreme remorse; his relatively young age (31) at the time of
    the offence; the absence of a criminal record or <em>Highway Traffic Act</em> conviction; good character; a father of three young children; and a hard
    worker. The aggravating factors were: the magnitude of the devastation he
    caused; his high blood alcohol level; and the unbelievable speed at which he
    was travelling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge next considered s. 718.2(e)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which requires a court that imposes a sentence
    to take into consideration the principle that all available sanctions, other
    than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with
    the harm done to victims or to the community should be considered for all
    offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal
    offenders. He reviewed the factors set out in the <em>Gladue</em> case,
    together with the information contained in the <em>Gladue</em> report
    concerning Mr. Altiman. In his reasons, the sentencing judge
    reproduced the summary of principles contained in para. 93 of the <em>Gladue</em> decision, the last of which states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>It is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal
    peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional sentencing goals such
    as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where warranted. In this context,
    generally, the more serious and violent the crime, the more likely it will be
    as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment will be the same for
    similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is aboriginal or non&#8209;aboriginal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In commenting on this part of the summary in the <em>Gladue</em> case, the sentencing judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The court has considered and applied the
    guidelines, but in reflecting on all of the information, the last paragraph
    stands out and the court sees the impaired death case, more than one victim in
    this case and other people badly injured, its a case where the sentence will
    be that that would be attributed to a non-aboriginal person or an aboriginal
    person. The court would assume that in all communities drinking driving causing
    death is something that all parties would like to sanction as in the last
    paragraph of the <em>Gladue </em>case guidelines above, as Ive indicated,
    thats the conclusion the Supreme Court of Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge noted that based on the
    reference letters written on behalf of Mr. Altiman, the event was totally out
    of character and [he was] an honest decent man doing a bad thing. What was
    involved was: a decent hardworking man who, despite all the obstacles in his
    way as noted in the <em>Gladue </em>report, was able to establish a normal life
    with children ages 13 and 11 and a spouse; he had no record, not even a traffic
    ticket.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>However, given the gravity of Mr. Altimans
    offences, the sentencing judge stated that: There was never an alternative to
    jail, even with the <em>Gladue </em>principles in play, given the enormity of
    the crime here and its consequences. In all communities such a crime is very
    serious and should be dealt with in that fashion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge then referred to two recent
    cases in the London area involving convictions for impaired driving causing
    death in which five and six-year jail sentences had been imposed. As well,
    [t]here are a number of other cases that involve death throughout our
    province, the cost in lives and grief just never seems to change year by year.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Altiman, the court has examined this case
    in every possible manner it could, and it has set out some of the things youve
    done to make it an easier prosecution, to admit your guilt from the beginning
    til the end. But this is such a significant loss, such a horrible waste of
    humanity, and Im counting you in that phrase young man, because your life now
    has been derailed and will be derailed for a period of some time. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>I should also note to counsel that Im
    recommending, although I have no say with Correctional Services Canada, that
    any federal penitentiary time this young man do, attempt at least to come to a
    facility that has programs for indigenous people. Again, I cant decide that, I
    can only recommend, which I do. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The sentence in this case is significant and I
    think - I hope the court has set out for the people here why that is so. The
    sentence will be ten years in the penitentiary. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge also imposed a 15-year
    driving prohibition commencing on the date of sentencing. Mr. Altiman does not
    appeal that part of his sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>IV.     THE ISSUES</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Altiman advances two grounds of appeal: (i)
    the sentence of 10 years imprisonment is excessive and does not reflect parity
    with sentences imposed on other offenders given the mitigating circumstances of
    this case; and (ii) the sentencing judge conducted a defective <em>Gladue</em> analysis by (a) failing to consider how the <em>Gladue</em> factors disclosed in
    the material filed at the sentencing hearing affected Mr. Altimans moral
    blameworthiness and (b) making assumptions about the preferred approach of
    Aboriginal communities to sentencing that were not grounded in the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In response, the Crown submits that: (i) this
    was an extreme example of criminal negligence causing death and serious bodily
    harm, involving drinking and driving, which properly attracted a penitentiary
    sentence at the high end of the range; and (ii) the sentencing judge properly
    applied the process mandated by <em>Gladue</em> and <em>Ipeelee</em> for
    sentencing an Aboriginal offender.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Sentencing is a highly individualized process,
    calling for a delicate balancing of the various sentencing principles and
    objectives, in line with the fundamental principle contained in s. 718.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of
    the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender: <em>R. v. Suter</em>,
    2018 SCC 34, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 496, at para. 4. As a result, appellate courts may
    not interfere lightly with a sentence imposed because trial judges have a broad
    discretion to impose the sentence that they consider appropriate within the
    limits established by law:<em> Lacasse</em>, at para. 39.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>An appellate court may only interfere with a
    sentence in one of two situations: (1) where the sentence imposed by the
    sentencing judge is demonstrably unfit; or (2) where the sentencing judge
    commits an error in principle, fails to consider a relevant factor, or
    erroneously considers an aggravating or mitigating factor, <em>and </em>such an
    error has an impact on the sentence imposed. In both situations, the appellate
    court may set aside the sentence and conduct its own analysis to determine a
    fit sentence in the circumstances:<em> Suter</em>, at para. 24;<em> Lacasse</em>,
    at paras. 41 and 44.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Courts have used a variety of expressions to
    describe a sentence that is demonstrably unfit. It is a sentence that is:
    clearly unreasonable; clearly or manifestly excessive; clearly excessive
    or inadequate; or that represents a substantial and marked departure from the
    sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing similar crimes:
    see, <em>R. v. Rezaie</em> (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 713 (C.A.), at p. 720; <em>R.
    v. Hall</em>, 2007 ONCA 8, 83 O.R. (3d) 641, leave to appeal refused, [2007]
    S.C.C.A. No. 298, at para. 29; <em>R. v. Junkert</em>, 2010 ONCA 549, 103 O.R.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>An inquiry into whether a sentence is

    principle that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence
    and the degree of responsibility of the offender. In <em>Lacasse</em>, the
    Supreme Court stated, at paras. 53 and 54:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>A sentence will therefore be demonstrably
    unfit if it constitutes an unreasonable departure from this principle.
    Proportionality is determined both on an individual basis, that is, in relation
    to the accused him or herself and to the offence committed by the accused, and
    by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar
    circumstances. Individualization and parity of sentences must be reconciled for
    a sentence to be proportionate: <a

    account. Once again, however, it is up to the trial judge to properly weigh
    these various principles and objectives, whose relative importance will
    necessarily vary with the nature of the crime and the circumstances in which it
    was committed. The principle of parity of sentences, on which the Court of
    Appeal relied, is secondary to the fundamental principle of proportionality.
    This Court explained this as follows in </span><em>M. (C.A.):</em></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-GB>It has been repeatedly stressed that there
    is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime.... Sentencing is

    does, lengthier sentences have been imposed, ranging from seven and one-half to

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>The analytical framework</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Altiman is an Aboriginal offender, which
    requires considering as part of the sentencing analysis the principles found in
    s. 781.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. In <em>R. v. F.H.L</em>, 2018 ONCA
    83, 360 C.C.C. (3d) 189, this court attempted to synthesize those principles,
    as elaborated in <em>Gladue</em> and <em>Ipeelee</em>. In <em>F.H.L.</em>, at
    paras. 38-40, this court summarized the proper approach to the application of
    the s. 718.2(e) principles:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The law, reviewed above, is clear. In order to
    be relevant to sentencing, an offenders Aboriginal background need not be
    causally connected to the offence(s) for which a sentence is being imposed. In
    what circumstances, then, will an offenders Aboriginal background influence
    their ultimate sentence? The answer is not so easily ascertained or
    articulated:&nbsp;<em>R. v. Whitehead</em>, 2016 SKCA 165, 344 C.C.C. (3d) 1,
    at para. 60. Clearly, the mere assertion of ones Aboriginal heritage is
    insufficient  </span><a
href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec718.2_smooth"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>s. 718.2</span></a><span
lang=EN-GB>(e) does not create a race-based discount on sentencing: <em>Ipeelee</em>,
    at para. 75. Although Aboriginal offenders are not required to draw a straight
    line between their Aboriginal roots and the offences for which they are being
    sentenced, more is required than the bare assertion of an offenders
    Aboriginal status: <em>R. v. Monckton</em>, 2017 ONCA 450, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 90,
    at para. 115.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>It is also insufficient for an Aboriginal
    offender to point to the systemic and background factors affecting Aboriginal
    people in Canadian society. While courts are obliged to take judicial notice of
    those factors, they do not necessarily justify a different sentence for
    Aboriginal offenders. Rather, they provide the necessary <span class=Underline>context </span>for understanding and evaluating the case-specific information presented
    by counsel: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 60 (emphasis in original); <em>R. v.
    Radcliffe</em>, 2017 ONCA 176, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 3, leave to appeal refused,
    [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 274, at para. 54.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>The correct approach may be articulated as
    follows. For an offenders Aboriginal background to influence his or her
    ultimate sentence, the systemic and background factors affecting Aboriginal
    people in Canadian society must have impacted the offenders life in a way that
    (1) bears on moral blameworthiness, or (2) indicates which types of sentencing
    objectives should be prioritized in the offenders case. This approach finds
    support both in <em>Ipeelee</em> and decisions of this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In dealing with the role played by systemic and
    background factors in the analysis, this court stated, at para. 47:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Systemic and background factors, however, do
    not operate as an excuse or justification for an offence: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at
    para. 83. They are only relevant to assessing the degree of responsibility of
    the offender, and to considering whether non-retributive sentencing objectives
    should be prioritized. Accordingly, <em>Gladue </em>and <em>Ipeelee </em>do not
    detract from the fundamental principle that a sentence must be proportionate
    to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender: <em>Ipeelee </em>at para. 73. What <em>Gladue </em>and <em>Ipeelee </em>recognize
    is that evaluating the degree of responsibility of an Aboriginal offender
    requires a different method of analysis: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 59. A
    different method of analysis does not necessarily mandate a different result: <em>Kakekagamick</em>,
    at para. 36. Crafting a just and appropriate sentence may, in some cases,
    require giving greater weight to sentencing objectives such as deterrence and
    denunciation: <em>Gladue</em>, at para. 78; <em>R. v. Wells</em>, 2000 SCC 10, [2000]
    1 S.C.R. 207, at para. 44. As this court recognized in <em>Kakekagamick</em>,
    at para. 42:&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-GB>To be clear, </span><a

lang=EN-GB>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In considering the first factor dealing with
    moral blameworthiness, s. 718.2(e) does not require an automatic reduction of a
    sentence or a remission of a warranted period of incarceration simply because
    the offender is Aboriginal: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 71. Instead, the section
    directs the sentencing judge to pay particular attention to the circumstances
    of Aboriginal offenders in order to endeavour to achieve a truly fit and proper
    sentence in any particular case: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 75. Part of that
    inquiry involves ascertaining whether the constrained circumstances of an Aboriginal
    offender  situations of social and economic deprivation with a lack of
    opportunities and limited options for positive development  may diminish the
    offenders moral culpability: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 73.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In considering the second set of circumstances 
    the types of sanctions which may be appropriate  the <em>Gladue</em> principles direct sentencing judges to abandon the presumption that all
    offenders and all communities share the same values when it comes to sentencing
    and to recognize that, given these fundamentally different world views,
    different or alternative sanctions may more effectively achieve the objectives
    of sentencing in a particular community: <em>Ipeele</em>e, at para. 74.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB> factors concerning Mr. Altiman disclosed by the record, I wish to
    comment on the portion of the sentencing judges reasons that reproduced the
    summary of principles contained in para. 93 of the <em>Gladue</em> decision,
    the last of which states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>It is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal
    peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional sentencing goals such
    as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where warranted. In this context,
    generally, the more serious and violent the crime, the more likely it will be
    as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment will be the same for
    similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is aboriginal or non&#8209;aboriginal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>That summary paragraph echoed the statement made
    earlier by the court in <em>Gladue</em>, at para. 79, that: Generally, the
    more violent and serious the offence the more likely it is as a practical
    reality that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals and non-aboriginals will
    be close to each other or the same, even taking into account their different
    concepts of sentencing. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Having quoted para. 93 of <em>Gladue</em>, the
    sentencing judge did not go on to recite the strong reminder subsequently issued
    in <em>Ipeelee</em> about the application of that part of the <em>Gladue</em> decision. At paras. 84, 85 and 87 of <em>Ipeelee</em>, the Supreme Court
    stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Numerous courts have erroneously interpreted
    this generalization [in <em>Gladue</em> para. 79] as an indication that the <em>Gladue </em>principles do not apply to serious offences Whatever criticisms may be
    directed at the decision of this Court for any ambiguity in this respect, the
    judgment ultimately makes it clear that sentencing judges have a <em>duty </em>to
    apply s. 718.2(<em>e</em>): There is no discretion as to whether to consider
    the unique situation of the aboriginal offender; the only discretion concerns
    the determination of a just and appropriate sentence  Similarly, in </span><em>Wells,</em><span
lang=EN-GB> Iacobucci J. reiterated, at para. 50, that</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-GB>[t]he generalization drawn in </span><em>Gladue</em><span

    imposed on aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders, was not meant to be a
    principle of universal application. In each case, the sentencing judge must
    look to the circumstances of the aboriginal offender.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB></span></p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>VIII.   ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>As mentioned, whether a sentence is demonstrably unfit requires
    considering the fundamental principle of proportionality, together with the
    sentencing objectives set out in s. 718 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-GB> and the other sentencing principles found in s. 718.2. I will deal
    first with the principle of proportionality.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The proportionality of a sentence is determined both on an
    individual basis and by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences
    committed in similar circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge held that Mr. Altimans moral blameworthiness
    was high because it was his choice to drink to excess and then drive a motor
    vehicle in the early morning hours when this event took place. I agree with
    that holding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>However, there is a significant factor that influences the
    assessment of the proportionality of the 10-year sentence imposed on Mr.
    Altiman, both when the proportionality is looked at on an individual basis and
    by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar
    circumstances. That factor is Mr. Altimans lack of a criminal or driving
    offences record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The sentencing judge described Mr. Altimans conduct in causing the
    collision as being totally out of character. The record fully supports that
    assessment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Yet, notwithstanding that assessment, the sentencing judge imposed a
    period of incarceration typically seen where the offender has a prior criminal
    or driving offences record. As I concluded from my review of the jurisprudence
    summarized in para. 70 above, over the past decade in this province sentences
    for impaired driving causing death typically have fallen in the four to
    six-year range where the offender has no prior criminal or driving record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>The 10-year custodial sentence imposed on Mr. Altiman by the
    sentencing judge represents a substantial and marked departure from the
    sentences customarily imposed in this province for similar offenders committing
    similar crimes. That is the case even taking into account both the fact that
    Mr. Altiman killed two people and seriously injured two others, as well as the
    primary role played by the principles of denunciation and deterrence in cases
    of impaired driving causing death. As such, the sentence is demonstrably unfit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>In my view, taking into account the circumstances and consequences
    of the collision, together with the jurisprudence and the considerations set
    out in ss. 718 and 718.2 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-GB>,
    a fit and proportionate sentence is one of seven years imprisonment. That
    sentence will reflect the high degree of moral culpability of Mr. Altiman and
    serve the sentencing purposes of deterrence and denunciation, while at the same
    time recognizing the out of character nature of Mr. Altimans conduct and the
    absence of any criminal or driving record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>I do not see the circumstances of Mr. Altiman as an Aboriginal
    offender altering that conclusion. <em>Ipeelee</em> requires ascertaining
    whether the constrained circumstances of an Aboriginal offender  situations of
    social and economic deprivation with a lack of opportunities and limited
    options for positive development  may diminish the offenders moral culpability: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 73. In the case of Mr. Altiman, there is no doubt
    that chronic alcoholism was present in the lives of most of his grandparents,
    who had attended residential schools. It was also a significant problem for
    both his father and step-father.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>However, it was not a problem for his mother, Donna Smith. In her
    letter of support filed at the sentencing hearing, Ms. Smith wrote that at a
    young age she made the decision not to consume alcohol. In the <em>Gladue</em> report, Ms. Smith is recorded as stating that due to the devastating impacts
    that alcohol abuse had on her family, while her sons were teenagers she tried
    to protect them by continually reminding them of the dangers of alcohol abuse.
    As Mr. Altiman put it in the <em>Gladue </em>report: [M]y parents are from two
    very different worlds  Mom did all the right things and Dad went about things
    in all the wrong ways.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Ms. Smiths decision not to consume alcohol evidently had a profound
    impact on her son. As the <em>Gladue</em> report quoted her, she noted that
    none of Scotts friends drink  they are all non-drinkers and when they found
    out what had happened they were devastated and said, this is not Scott! Ms.
    Smiths view finds support in the numerous letters filed on behalf of Mr.
    Altiman at the sentencing hearing. None made mention of an observable alcohol
    problem by Mr. Altiman prior to the collision. Two letters did advert to Mr.
    Altimans use of alcohol. One written by Mr. Garnet Peters, who had known Mr.
    Altiman since he was six years old, stated that Mr. Altiman was never a heavy
    drinker. Another, written by Delbert Riley who had known Mr. Altiman for about
    four years before the collision, stated that Mr. Altiman was not a drunk or
    drug addict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>While Mr. Altiman lived in the community of Walpole First Nation for
    part of his elementary school years, he completed his education in London. He
    returned to live in an Aboriginal community with Ms. Young, but they left for
    the London area in order to access better schools for their children. The
    information before the sentencing judge showed that Mr. Altiman had worked
    steadily from a young age, reaching the position of operations manager of a
    bingo hall. His employer lauded his abilities. Mr. Altiman volunteered
    extensively in his community, coaching a variety of youth sports teams. The
    sentencing judge described Mr. Altiman as an honest, decent, hardworking father
    of two. The record firmly supports that characterization.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, based on the record before this court, I do not see the
    circumstances of Mr. Altiman as an Aboriginal offender diminishing his moral
    culpability so as to require any further reduction in his custodial sentence in
    order to satisfy the fundamental principle of proportionality.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Nor do I see anything in the record that would suggest the sanction
    of incarceration for the offences of impaired driving causing death and bodily
    harm would not be appropriate given that Mr. Altiman is an Aboriginal offender.
    There is nothing in the letters written in support of Mr. Altiman or elsewhere
    in the sentencing record that would indicate that the Aboriginal communities in
    which he has lived and with which he still maintains very strong ties hold
    different world views or values when it comes to sentencing for the offences of
    impaired driving causing death and bodily harm. The sentencing judge did
    recommend, in accordance with the </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-GB> report, that Mr. Altiman serve the custodial part of his sentence in a facility
    that has programs for Aboriginal offenders, a recommendation with which I agree
    and adopt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this issue, I have
    read the reasons of my colleague, Sharpe J.A., who reaches a different
    conclusion. My colleague would reduce Mr. Altimans custodial sentence by a
    further year. I respectfully cannot agree. Our disagreement is not one over the
    applicable legal principles: those articulated in <em>Gladue</em> and <em>Ipeelee</em> govern. However, in my respectful view, a three-year reduction in Mr. Altimans
    sentence based on the analysis of the impaired driving causing death
    jurisprudence results in a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the
    offences and the degree of responsibility of Mr. Altiman, taking into account
    the sentencing principles in ss. 718 and 718.2, including the intergenerational
    trauma my colleague refers to.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-GB>IX.     DISPOSITION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>For the reasons set out above, I would grant Mr. Altiman leave to
    appeal his sentence. I would set aside the 10-year sentence of imprisonment as
    unfit, and would substitute a term of imprisonment of seven years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-GB>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>Mr. Altiman did not appeal the 15-year driving prohibition. However,
    the sentencing judge ordered that the prohibition order commence on the date of
    sentencing, contrary to the direction of the Supreme Court in <em>Lacasse</em>,
    at para. 109, that a driving prohibition commences at the end of the period of
    imprisonment. In order to give effect to the sentencing judges intention,
    while at the same time complying with <em>Lacasse</em>, I would vary the term
    of the driving prohibition to eight years, to commence at the end of Mr.
    Altimans period of imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-US>I have read the reasons of my colleague Brown J.A. I agree with his
    analysis of the non-</span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> factors. However,
    as I will explain, I take a different view of the issue arising from </span><em>R.
    v. Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 and </span><em>R. v.
    Ipeelee</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In my view, the sentencing judge erred in law with respect to the </span><em>Gladue/Ipeelee </em><span lang=EN-US>issue. As my colleague notes, the sentencing judge quoted
    at length from </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> and then paid particular
    attention to the Courts statement, at para. 93, that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>generally<span lang=EN-GB>, the more serious and violent the
    crime, the more likely it will be as a practical matter that the terms of
    imprisonment will be the same for similar offences and offenders, whether the
    offender is aboriginal or non&#8209;aboriginal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The sentencing judge stated that this paragraph stood out and that
    as this was a serious offence, he would be guided by it when determining the
    appropriate sentence. He stated that the sentence would not be affected by
    consideration of </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> factors. The
    sentencing judge did not refer to </span><em>Ipeelee,</em><span lang=EN-US> at
    para. 84, where Lebel J. pointed out that statement from </span><em>Gladue</em> <span lang=EN-US>emphasized by the sentencing judge had received unwarranted
    emphasis and that [n]umerous courts have erroneously interpreted this
    generalization as an indication that the </span><em>Gladue </em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellants submission that, as a result of this
    error, the sentencing judge failed to factor into his sentencing decision the
    systemic and background factors of the appellant as an Indigenous person and to
    consider whether and how those factors bore upon the appellants moral
    blameworthiness for the offence. By reasoning as he did, the sentencing judge
    failed to follow the direction in</span><em><span lang=EN-US> </span></em><em>Ipeelee</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 86, that [t]here is no sense comparing the sentence that
    a particular Aboriginal offender would receive to the sentence that some
    hypothetical non-Aboriginal offender would receive, because there is only one
    offender standing before the court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I disagree with my colleague that the systemic and background
    factors of the appellant as an Indigenous person have no bearing upon his moral
    blameworthiness for this offence. There can be no doubt that the appellants
    decision to drink and drive that lead to such horrific consequences exhibited a
    high degree of moral blameworthiness. However, it is my view that the </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> report submitted to the sentencing judge did reveal systemic and
    background factors that do explain and to some extent mitigate the appellants
    moral blameworthiness for this offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    It is only by looking at whether and how the historic and systemic

lang=EN-US>I will not repeat the evidence recited by my colleague as to the
    appellants Indigenous background. However, as I take a different view of that
    evidence, I will state the parts of it that I find particularly relevant to the </span><em>Gladue/Ipeelee</em><span lang=EN-US> analysis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant is a member of the Walpole Island First Nation
    (Bkejwanong). His mother, his biological father and his step-father are also of
    Indigenous heritage, as were his grandparents. The appellant grew up on the
    Walpole Island reserve but finished his schooling in London. The appellant
    experienced racist taunts as a young person when playing hockey and at school. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> report noted several
    undisputed features of the appellants background that deserve to be considered
    in assessing his moral blameworthiness for this offence. The appellant grew up
    on a reserve where alcohol abuse was prevalent. The appellants biological
    father was an abusive alcoholic and his alcoholism lead to his estrangement
    from the appellant. The appellants grandmother died from alcohol-induced
    dementia. His step-father, who came into the appellants life early on, was raised
    by residential school survivors. He used alcohol to drown everything out and
    had difficulty displaying affection. When the appellant was too young to drive,
    his step-father would take him out on the dirt roads on the reserve so that his
    step-father could drink. The appellant reported that his life was impacted by
    his step-fathers consumption of alcohol on a daily basis to solve his
    problems. The appellant was abandoned by both his biological father and his
    step-father.  He attributes their lack of emotional connection in part to the
    intergenerational impact of Canadas colonial Indigenous policies. The
    appellant also reported to the </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> author
    that being raised to drink, he drank when times were bad and that drinking
    took away everything. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The </span><em>Gladue</em><span lang=EN-US> report reveals many
    other disturbing features of the intergenerational impact of residential
    schools in the appellants family. Among these is the fact that the appellants
    mother was raised by residential school survivors and she experienced physical
    abuse that she attributed to their residential school experience. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellants submission that the </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> report supports an inference that the offence he committed was
    connected with many of the features of intergenerational trauma that are at the
    core of the </span><em>Gladue/Ipeelee</em><span lang=EN-US> analysis. When he
    turned to alcohol as a means of coping with the threat of marital breakdown, he
    was conditioned to do so by a pattern of dysfunctional family life and alcohol
    abuse typically attributed to the historic and systemic disadvantages
    experience by Indigenous people in Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>As my colleague observes, through the very positive influence of his
    mother, up to the time of the events at issue, the appellant had largely
    avoided or overcome the impact of these systemic and background factors and had
    developed a healthy and sober lifestyle. However, I do not agree with my
    colleague that this positive picture erases from consideration the lingering
    effects of the appellants Indigenous background. His mother reported to the </span><em>Gladue</em><span
lang=EN-US> author that she now realized that her efforts to prevent historical
    trauma from affecting the lives of her children had not been enough. A mothers
    excellent teaching and example can go a long way to putting her child on the
    right track, but even a strong mother cannot always erase the indelible marks left
    by patterns of systemic disadvantage and alcohol abuse.  I add here that it is
    well-established that the Indigenous offender need not establish </span>a
    causal link between the systemic and background factors [that bear upon
    sentence] and commission of the offence: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 82; <em>R.
    v. Collins</em>, 2011 ONCA 182, 277 O.A.C. 88, at para. 32.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The systemic and background factors that I have identified as
    affecting the appellant certainly do not operate as an excuse or
    justification (</span><em>Ipeelee</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 83) for his
    conduct. They do, however, give a fuller picture of the appellant and help the
    court to understand his conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I agree with my colleagues non-</span><em>Gladue/Ipeelee</em><span
lang=EN-US> analysis. This offence was very serious and certainly warrants a
    significant term of imprisonment. However, as I am of the view that
    consideration of the evidence relevant to the </span><em>Gladue/Ipeelee</em><span
lang=EN-US> principle sheds considerable light on the appellants moral
    blameworthiness and supports a modest reduction in his sentence, I would allow
    the appeal and impose a sentence of six years rather than seven years.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>I do not doubt the need for deterrence and denunciation in this
    case. I am also conscious that, in the words of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-US>, s. 718.2(e), the sentence must be consistent with the harm done
    to victims or the community. However, a sentence crafted for the dominant
    purpose of deterrence and denunciation without regard to the full picture of
    the appellant revealed by the </span><em>Gladue</em> <span lang=EN-US>report
    would not be fit. The need for deterrence, denunciation and imposing a sentence
    consistent with the harm to the victims, must be balanced with a full and fair
    consideration of the appellants background and moral blameworthiness. Section
    718.1 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em> <span lang=EN-US>directs that [a] sentence
    must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of
    responsibility of the offender. </span><em>Ipeelee</em><span lang=EN-US> holds, at para. 37, </span>a sentence must not exceed what is appropriate,
    given the moral blameworthiness of the offender: see also <em>R. v. Martin</em>,
    2018 ONCA 1029, at para. 20. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>A sentence of six years is sufficient to satisfy the need for
    deterrence. I would follow the approach taken by this court in </span><em>Martin</em> where it was accepted that penitentiary sentence was required but where, as
    here, there were relevant <em>Gladue</em> factors to consider. The court
    stated, at para. 19 that there is no reason to believe that a six-year
    sentence would have a greater deterrent effect for the appellant specifically
    or for other offenders than a four-year sentence. In my view that same can be
    said in this case for a six-year sentence rather than a seven-year sentence.</p>
