    offender and sentenced to an indeterminate period of incarceration. He conceded
    before the sentencing judge and accepts for the purposes of this appeal that he
    meets the criteria to be designated a dangerous offender. He argues, however,
    that the sentencing judge erred by imposing an indeterminate period of
    incarceration.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant pleaded guilty in 2004 of sexually
    assaulting four children aged between seven and thirteen years old. He was
    sentenced to two years less a day imprisonment in addition to pre-sentence
    custody, plus three years’ probation. An order was made under s. 161 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>,</span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>&nbsp;R.S.C. 1985,
    c. C-46,</span><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>prohibiting him for life from attending

    contact with his spouse and two children. Ignoring the directive of the
    Children’s Aid Society, he moved in with his spouse and children. In 2011, he
    pleaded guilty to sexual interference and sexual assault with two of his
    children. He admitted to having had anal sex with his 12-13-year-old son and
    vaginal intercourse with his 11-12-year-old daughter on several occasions. He
    also pleaded guilty to breach of the s. 161 prohibition order. </span></p>

    testified that the appellant was a pedophile with a high risk of reoffending.
    He was pessimistic about managing the appellant in the community. Dr. Fedoroff,
    the psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the appellant, agreed that the
    appellant was a pedophile with a moderate to high risk of reoffending if not
    treated. However, Dr. Fedoroff testified that he believed that pedophilia could
    be cured and that if appropriate steps were taken, including drug treatment,
    the appellant could be managed in the community. Dr. Fedoroff acknowledged,
    however, that he had concerns about the appellant’s motivation for treatment.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not accept the submission that the
    sentencing judge erred by rejecting the joint sentencing submission. The
    sentencing judge followed the approach outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada
    in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Anthony-Cook</span></em><span lang=EN-US>,
    2016 SCC 43, [2016] 2 S.C.R. 204. At three points during the evidentiary phase
    of the sentencing hearing, the sentencing judge expressed his concerns about
    the adequacy of the proposed determinate sentence and of the evidence to
    support it. This was sufficient to put the appellant on notice that the
    sentencing judge was considering rejecting the joint submission. Despite that
    notice, the appellant took no steps to strike the guilty plea or to seek the
    opportunity to advance additional evidence. The sentencing judge gave clear and
    cogent reasons for departing from the joint submission, emphasizing the
    overriding consideration of the protection of the public and the mandatory
    regime set out in s. 753(4.1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Would the proposed sentence be contrary to the
    public interest or otherwise bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, the detailed reasons of the
    sentencing judge demonstrate that he concluded that a determinate sentence would
    be “contrary to the public interest” and would bring “the administration of
    justice into disrepute”. While the sentencing judge did not use those specific
    words, he did refer to the “the overriding consideration of protection of the
    public in a dangerous offender application”. He concluded that the evidence
    failed to show that the appellant’s risk could be managed in the community and
    that if released, the appellant posed a danger to children. He accepted Dr.
    Woodside’s pessimism about the possibility of managing the appellant in the
    community. He noted that while Dr. Fedoroff was more hopeful, that hope was primarily
    based upon the appellant accepting drug therapy. The unchallenged evidence
    established that the appellant had demonstrated an unwillingness to take drug
    therapy in the past and indicated to Dr. Woodside that he did not feel he
    needed the treatment. While in the end he told Dr. Woodside that he might try
    drug therapy, the sentencing judge concluded that given the problems with
    ensuring compliance, he had no confidence that anti-androgen therapy could form
    a part of a long-term treatment plan for the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, s. 753(4.1), required the sentencing judge to impose an
    indeterminate period of incarceration unless the judge was satisfied </span><span
lang=EN>that there was “a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure… will
    adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of murder
    or a serious personal injury offence”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After a thorough review of the evidence, the
    trial judge concluded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>There is no
    cogent, reliable evidence that R.S.’s pedophilia can be managed, let alone
    cured. There is no plan that he can be rehabilitated within a certain period of
    time. The suggestion that R.S. will respond to counselling and drug therapy
    lies in the realm of speculation only. Apart from [Dr. Fedoroff’s] suggestions
    that a Circle of Support be utilized, there is a total absence of evidence
    about a support plan for R.S. upon his release into the community. These
    concerns highlight the lack of an evidentiary basis to establish the “reasonable
    expectation” contemplated by s. 753 (4.1).</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our view, the sentencing judge’s conclusion
    that the appellant could not realistically be managed in the community was well-supported
    by the record, particularly in the light of the following facts: </span></p>
