  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the convictions entered on November 15,
    2016 by Justice M. Garson of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial before Garson J. of the Superior Court of Justice,
    sitting with a jury, the appellant was convicted of three offences – invitation
    to sexual touching, sexual assault and sexual interference. He was acquitted of
    the offence of assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The criminal charges were historical in nature. The complainant was the
    appellant’s step-son. He alleged that the appellant had engaged in
    inappropriate sexual behaviour, including asking him to watch him masturbate,
    sexual touching, and one incident of oral sex. The sexual incidents allegedly
    occurred when the complainant was between the ages of 8 and 13.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s first trial ended in a mistrial in October 2015 because
    the jury was unable to reach a verdict. At the second trial, in November 2016,
    the convictions, and acquittal, set out above were entered.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his convictions on five grounds. Two are
    stand-alone grounds and three relate to alleged errors in the trial judge’s
    jury charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant contends that the jury reached inconsistent
    verdicts in acquitting the appellant of assault, but in finding him guilty of
    the three sexual offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission. In our view, the jury’s verdict of not
    guilty on the assault charge is not inconsistent with the findings of guilt on
    the sexual offence charges. The guilty verdicts for all three sexual offences
    are reconcilable with the not guilty on the assault count based on the
    differences between the elements of the offences, the nature of the evidence
    applicable to each count, and the scope of the credibility findings the jury
    was entitled to make. To cite but one example, because of the complainant’s
    age, consent was not an issue with respect to the sexual offences. On the other
    hand, on the assault charge, the complainant’s own testimony about ‘play
    fighting’ with the appellant on occasion made consent a live issue on the
    assault charge. The jury’s verdicts on the various counts in the indictment is,
    easily, “supportable on any theory of the evidence consistent with the legal
    instructions given by the trial judge”: see <em>R. v. Pittiman</em>, 2006 SCC 9,
    at para. 7.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in admitting
    into evidence the appellant’s videotaped statement to police following his
    arrest. In that statement, there was this exchange:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Officer: Asking that … asking someone you know to touch you or
    asking if you can touch them, that’s invitation to sexual touching.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Appellant: That happened.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant went on to admit that he had asked if he could touch the
    complainant, but the complainant had said ‘No’. He also admitted that he
    propositioned the complainant to engage in oral sex, but the complainant had
    declined. The appellant maintained that no actual sexual contact had occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s statement to police was admitted at his first trial
    after a contested voluntariness <em>voir dire</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the appellant’s second trial, counsel explicitly agreed that the previous
    ruling would apply. This agreement was based on s. 653.1 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>653.1 In the case of a mistrial, unless the court is satisfied
    that it would not be in the interests of justice, rulings relating to the …
    admissibility of evidence … that were made during the trial are binding on the
    parties in any new trial. …</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of the appeal, we assume that appeal counsel is entitled to raise
    this issue. We see nothing “in the interests of justice” to suggest that
    counsels’ shared position at trial should be overturned. Specifically, we note
    that the judge at the first trial watched the video of the appellant’s
    statement and was, therefore, in a perfect position to assess it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury
    about how to consider and assess evidence that might be relevant to more than
    one count in the indictment. Specifically, the appellant says that the trial
    judge should have instructed the jury that if it did not believe the
    complainant’s evidence that he had been assaulted in a non-sexual manner (the
    jury acquitted the appellant on the assault charge), then it was entitled to
    use that disbelief in assessing the sexual assault allegations. In other words,
    the trial judge should have expressly instructed the jury that it was entitled
    to assess the complainant’s credibility with reference to evidence across all
    the counts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. Nothing in the trial judge’s instructions suggested that the jury
    should compartmentalize its credibility findings. The jury was told that they
    “must not use evidence that relates only to one charge in making their decision
    on any other charge.” In <em>R. v. A.W.B.</em>, 2015 ONCA 185, this court said
    that this precise formulation “did not prevent the jury from applying findings
    of the complainant’s general credibility to all counts” (paras. 35-36).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the jury was instructed to consider the evidence in its entirety in
    deciding how much or little to rely on a witness’ evidence. The jury was also
    told to use common sense in deciding whether to believe none, some or all of a
    witness’ evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge provided a confusing and unhelpful
    instruction on the issue of consent as it related to the sexual assault charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that a small portion of the jury charge, relating to only the sexual
    assault charge, was potentially confusing. However, read in its entirety, the
    trial judge’s charge made it clear that because of the complainant’s age at the
    time of the offences, consent was not an element the Crown needed to prove to
    ground a conviction for sexual assault. Moreover, the trial judge provided a
    draft jury charge to counsel. Neither counsel objected to the charge on this
    issue. Indeed, both counsel agreed during the pre-charge conference that
    consent was not a live issue on the sexual assault count. In any event, the
    small confusion could not have prejudiced the appellant; indeed, if anything it
    worked to his benefit. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury
    about how to use the appellant’s prior inconsistent statement, especially in
    relation to the statements he allegedly made at the ‘family meeting’ that was
    called after the complainant made allegations about the appellant’s behaviour
    toward him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission. With respect to what the appellant said at the
    family meeting, the trial judge instructed the jury:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Unless you decide that [the appellant] made a particular remark
    or statement you must not consider it in deciding this case. You may give
    anything that you find [the appellant] said as much or as little importance as
    you think it deserves in deciding this case. It is for you to say.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>We see no problem with this instruction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction appeal is dismissed. The appellant has abandoned his sentence
    appeal.</p>
