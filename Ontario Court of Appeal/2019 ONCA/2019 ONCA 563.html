  <p class=Heard>Heard: March 26, 2019 </p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom align=left style='text-align:left'>On appeal from the
    order of Justice Jill M. Copeland of the Superior Court of Justice, dated
    October 1, 2018, with reasons reported at 2018 ONSC 5750. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Huscroft J.A.:</p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Nissa Corporation (“Nissa”), inherited a lease between
    the respondent, Enviro Park Solar Ltd., (the “Tenant”) and 1809765 Ontario Limited
    (“180 Ontario”), the original landlord, when it purchased two properties in
    Napanee, 61A and 60A Enviro Park Lane (“61A” and “60A”) from the B<span
style='color:black;background:white'>usiness Development Bank of Canada</span>,
    the mortgagee in possession of the property. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lease governed the rooftop and certain rights of way at 61A for the
    purpose of operating a solar power generation project. The Tenant and 180
    Ontario were both controlled by Karl Hollett when the lease was entered into.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nissa disputed the validity of the lease and the Tenant brought an
    application seeking declarations that: (i) the lease was effective and binding
    on the parties to the lease and their successors; (ii) the Tenant was the owner
    of certain equipment on the premises; and (iii) Nissa had wrongly prevented the
    Tenant from accessing the property. Nissa took the position that the roof lease
    had been terminated prior to its purchase of the property, or in any event,
    after the expiry of the cure period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 14, 2017, Myers J. granted all three declarations, and in
    addition awarded damages caused by Nissa’s failure to allow the Tenant to
    access the property and resulting loss of solar power production.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, Nissa took the position that the manner in which the solar
    generation system had been installed did not comply with the terms of the lease
    and that additional rent was therefore owing. This led to a second application
    and the decision that is the subject of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the second application, the application judge ordered that Nissa was
    required to maintain the Tenant’s connection to the local electrical utility system
    via the transformer in the building across the street, at 60A Enviro Park Lane
    – a building not mentioned in any part of the lease – and that it was not
    entitled to receive any additional rents for that connection. The application
    judge ordered, further, that the Tenant had the right to install inverters in
    the electrical room of the building at 61A.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nissa argues that the application judge erred by reading a positive
    covenant into the lease, requiring it to provide the Tenant with access to the
    transformer at 60A Enviro Park Lane. She erred, further, in interpreting the
    lease as permitting the Tenant to install and operate inverters inside the
    building at 61A, in essence allowing conduct of the former landlord to
    overwhelm the express terms of the lease. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge erred in law by reading the lease as
    requiring that a connection to the transformer at 60A be maintained. However,
    her interpretation of the lease as permitting the Tenant to install inverters
    inside the building at 61A reveals no error and is entitled to deference. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal in part for the reasons that follow.</p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge was required to decide only two questions. First, is the
    Tenant entitled under the terms of the lease to connect to the local electrical
    utility system via the transformer located on the property at 60A Enviro Park
    Lane? Second, is the Tenant entitled under the terms of the lease to have
    inverters, which are part of the solar power generating system, located in the
    electrical room of the building at 61A Enviro Park Lane rather than on the
    roof? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant provisions of the lease are set out in the appendix to these reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The application judge’s decision</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Concerning
    the first issue, the application judge noted that the lease was entered into when
    180 Ontario owned both 61A and 60A Enviro Park Lane. She concluded that
    although the lease did not refer specifically to 60A, read in context it
    supported the Tenant’s submission that it had the right to connect to the
    electrical utility system via the transformer that was located at 60A. The
    solar project was central to the lease, as demonstrated by the provision in s.
    5(a) that the Tenant satisfy itself of the ability to connect to the electrical
    utility system as a Tenant’s condition in the lease. Section 11(b) limited the
    landlord’s activities not only on the Roof or other parts of the Building or
    Property, but also on any lands adjacent to the Property, and the application
    judge found that 60A was properly considered “adjacent” for purposes of the
    lease. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the second issue, the application judge agreed with the Tenant that s. 2 of the
    lease, which defines the right of way that is leased to the Tenant pursuant to
    s. 6(a), is clearly not limited to the Roof Area as it includes “(i) such
    rights, interests, rights-of-way, easements and privileges in any way
    pertaining thereto and set forth in greater detail herein and (ii) such rights
    of ingress and egress to the Property as may be reasonably necessary for the
    Tenant’s use of the Roof Area in accordance with the terms hereof, to have and
    to hold for and during the Term.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that, although the definition of “Roof Equipment”
    requires that it is to be “located on the Roof Area” and includes inverters,
    “Connecting Equipment” in s. 2(b)(i) is not limited to the rooftop location.
    Because the inverters are also included in the definition of “Connecting
    Equipment”, the lease does not limit their installation to the Roof Area. The
    application judge rejected Nissa’s argument that the Tenant had a right only to
    use or travel across the Property other than the Roof, because the lease
    necessarily contemplated the connection of some equipment/wires from the solar
    panels on the Roof and out of the Building in order to join the local electrical
    utility system, and this equipment would necessarily be installed permanently.
    The application judge also considered that the separate listing of rights to
    access to the Roof Area and the Connecting Rights of Way in s. 2(b)(ii)
    supported the argument that the rights in s. 2(b)(i) were more than just access
    rights.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge therefore granted the Tenant’s application.</p>
  <p class=Heading>DISCUSSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is now well established, following the decision in <em>Sattva Capital Corp. v.
    Creston Moly Corp.</em>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, that contractual
    interpretation of non-standard form contracts is properly characterized as a
    mixed question of fact and law and is subject to deferential review on appeal.
    The standard of review is palpable and overriding error, unless it is possible
    to identify an extricable question of law, in which case correctness review
    applies.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Sattva</em><i> </i>emphasizes that questions of law are relatively rare, but the Supreme Court
    identified three examples of legal errors that may occur in the course of
    contractual interpretation: “the application of an incorrect principle, the
    failure to consider a required element of a legal test, or the failure to
    consider a relevant factor”: <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 53 (citing <em>King v.
    Operating Engineers Training Institute of Manitoba Inc.</em>, 2011 MBCA 80, 270
    Man. R. (2d) 63, at para. 21). Nissa does not argue that the application judge
    made a palpable and overriding error. Accordingly, the burden is on Nissa to
    establish an error on a question of law, as contemplated in <em>Sattva</em>.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The right to connect at 60A</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nissa
    argues that the lease is restricted to 61A Enviro Park Lane; that by its terms
    it does not and cannot grant access to or use of any other property; and that
    the application judge erred in law by implying a term into the lease
    essentially granting the Tenant a license to use the transformer at 60A Enviro
    Park Lane. Nissa describes s.11(b) as a negative covenant of non-interference
    that does not create positive obligations, and argues that the application
    judge erred in interpreting the word “adjacent” as including a building across
    the road from the leased premises.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the application judge erred in interpreting the lease as it relates
    to this issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that, read as a whole, the lease supported the
    Tenant’s right to connect to the electrical utility system via the transformer
    at 60A. She focused on s. 6(d), which <span style='color:black;background:white'>gives
    the Tenant a right to make necessary connections to the local electrical
    utility system, and s. </span>11(b), which <span style='color:black;background:
white'>provides that the landlord covenants “not to initiate or conduct or
    carry on maintenance or other activities” that it knows or reasonably should
    know would adversely affect the solar energy project.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted that when the lease was signed, both 60A and 61A were
    owned by 180 Ontario, and that both properties are now owned by Nissa. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge treated ss. 6(d) and 11(b) as extending the leasehold
    interest to include 60A, but in doing so she failed to give effect to all of
    the relevant provisions in the lease, including the definitions of Property,
    Building, Roof, Roof Area and Project. These definitions operate to clearly
    limit the leasehold interest to 61A. Section 6(a) specifically provides that
    the Tenant leases the Roof Area and rights, interests, rights-of-way, easements
    and privileges and rights of ingress and egress to the Property, which is
    defined as “lands municipally known as 61A Enviro Park Lane… together with all easements,
    rights-of-way and other interests and appurtenances relating thereto.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the negative language in s. 11(b), which precludes the Landlord from
    engaging in activities that adversely affect the solar energy project, cannot
    be construed as creating an easement, right-of-way or other interest in land
    not subject to the lease. The application judge erred in relying on the
    language of this negative covenant to enlarge the description of the leasehold
    interest to include 60A, despite the definitions in the lease that clearly
    limit the leasehold interest to 61A.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The placement of the inverters</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nissa
    argues that the application judge erred in law by failing to apply the correct
    test for contractual interpretation. Specifically, Nissa says that, although
    the application judge correctly set out the principles in <em>Sattva</em>, she
    erred by excluding Mr. Hollett’s evidence, which should have been admitted as
    objective evidence of the circumstances surrounding the negotiations. The
    application judge erred, further, in failing to consider the practical
    consequences of her interpretation of the lease, which Nissa asserts undermines
    its use of the inside of the Building and its commercial interests, contrary to
    the principle of commercial reasonableness.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reject these arguments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the application judge had concerns about the reliability of Mr. Hollett’s
    evidence, but ultimately rejected it on the basis of her finding that it went
    beyond what <em>Sattva</em> permitted. She made no error in doing so. Although
    in the unusual circumstances of this case the lease was entered into by related
    corporations, both of which were controlled by Mr. Hollett, his affidavit is
    evidence about the subjective intentions of the parties, and is impermissible
    on this account: see <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 59. It was also opinion evidence
    as to how the lease ought to be interpreted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge specifically instructed herself concerning the need to
    interpret the lease in accordance with sound commercial principles, as set out
    in the leading decisions of this court, at para. 30 of her decision. In
    essence, the Landlord is advancing on appeal the same argument that was rejected
    by the application judge – that s. 2(b) does not permit inverters to be
    installed anywhere other than the Roof.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge provided cogent reasons in support of her conclusion
    rejecting this argument. By its terms, s. 2(b)(i) provided that Connecting
    Equipment, which included inverters, may be connected in places other than the
    Roof. The language of s. 2(b) was very broad and included provisions designed
    to facilitate the operation of a solar power system, which necessarily involved
    the connection of the solar panels on the Roof to equipment that exited the
    Building in order to connect to the electrical utility system. Thus, the
    application judge interpreted the right of way broadly rather than narrowly&nbsp;–
    as more than simply a right of access to the Roof.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, the application judge’s interpretation of the lease with respect to
    the issue of inverters reveals no legal error and is reasonable. There is no
    basis for this court to intervene on appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal in part. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Tenant is not entitled under the lease to connect to the electrical utility
    system via the transformer at 60A Enviro Park Lane. The Tenant is entitled to
    have inverters located in the building at 61A Enviro Park Lane.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the divided success, I would order the parties to bear their own costs
    of the appeal. I would vacate the application judge’s costs order, and order the
    parties to each bear their own costs of the application.</p>

    tests and inspections as the tenant may reasonably require in order to satisfy

    the event that neither a Notice of satisfaction of the Tenant’s Condition nor a
    Notice waiving the Tenant’s Condition has been delivered by the Tenant to the
    Landlord by 11:59 p.m. EST on the day which is the thirty-six (36) month
    anniversary of the date of this Lease, this Lease shall terminate and be of no
    further force and effect and neither Party shall have any further obligations
    or liability to the other, save and except for the Tenant’s obligations under

    with (i) such rights, interests, rights-of-way, easements and privileges in any
    way pertaining thereto and set forth in greater detail herein and (ii) such
    rights of ingress and egress to the Property as may be reasonably necessary for
    the Tenant’s use of the Roof Area in accordance with the terms hereof, to have
    any to hold for and during the Term. </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>(b) The Landlord agrees that the
    Tenant and its contractors, agents, employees and invitees (including, without
    limitation, the OPA) shall have unrestricted access to the Roof Area, the
    Connecting Right-of-Way and Access Right-of- Way at all times during the Term,

    emergency, the Tenant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
    Landlord with at least twenty-four (24) hours prior notice of the need to
    access such areas and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
    interference with the business of the Landlord or other Building tenants. </p>

    necessary connections to the local electrical utility system so long as such
    connection will not cause an overload to such system(s), and (iii) access to
    all such areas of the Property for the purposes of performing the foregoing
    actions. The Tenant covenants to use its best efforts to minimize any
    disruptions to business operations on the Property in exercising its rights

    agrees to keep the Roof and the structural elements of the Building in good
    repair at all times during the Term, provided that the Landlord shall not
    initiate or conduct or carry on maintenance or other activities to, on or
    affecting the Roof or other parts of the Building or the Property, or on any
    lands adjacent to the Property, that it knows, or should reasonably know, may
    damage, impair or otherwise adversely affect the Project or its function (including
    activities that may adversely affect the Project’s exposure to sunlight), or
    cause the Tenant to be in breach of its obligations under the FIT Contract.</p>
