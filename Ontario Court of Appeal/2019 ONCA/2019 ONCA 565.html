  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of one count of sexual assault and one count
    of threatening death following a trial by judge alone. He was sentenced to two
    years in custody, less time served. In his notice of appeal, the appellant
    indicated that he appealed from conviction and sentence. In oral argument, duty
    counsel focused on the conviction appeal. The appellant did not make any oral
    submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duty<span lang=EN-US> counsel advances one ground of appeal: allowing
    the appellant’s convictions to stand in the face of the breach of
    solicitor-client privilege that occurred during his trial would constitute a
    miscarriage of justice.</span> We agree. For the reasons that follow, we would
    allow the conviction appeal and order a new trial. It is therefore unnecessary
    to address the sentence appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Background</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant pleaded not guilty to sexual assault and threatening
    death. The events giving rise to those charges occurred on September 27, 2015.
    Both the appellant and the complainant testified at trial about what happened. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that while she was waiting at a bus stop, the
    appellant approached her from behind and said either “hey cutie” or “hey sexy”.
    When she did not respond, the appellant grabbed her by the hair and put his
    hand over her mouth. Then, he dragged her on her knees to an alleyway and put
    his hand down her shirt, underneath her bra. He also put his hand inside her
    leggings, underneath her underwear, and touched her genitals. The appellant
    kept a hand over the complainant’s mouth throughout the assault. At one point,
    the complainant managed to get the appellant’s hand off her mouth long enough
    to start screaming. This prompted the appellant to tell her “shut the fuck up
    or I will kill you”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his testimony, the appellant denied sexually assaulting the
    complainant, though he admitted to assaulting her. He stated that he was trying
    to frighten the complainant, because he mistakenly thought she was a friend of
    his former girlfriend. He hoped that by frightening the complainant, his former
    girlfriend would get the message that he was still angry with her. So, he
    walked up to the complainant and said “where’s Tasha”, referring to his former
    girlfriend. When the complainant did not respond, he grabbed her by the collar,
    shook her, and slapped her across the face. He asked the complainant “where are
    all your friends now”, to which she responded several times by asking what he
    was talking about. After the appellant slapped her, the complainant fell to the
    ground and the appellant decided to walk away. He denied touching the
    complainant’s breast or reaching down her pants. He acknowledged that he may
    have told her to “shut the fuck up” but denied threatening to kill her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    testimony. He accepted the complainant’s testimony, and found that it left him
    without a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before turning to the trial judge’s reasons, however, it is necessary to
    review an interaction that occurred between the trial judge and defence counsel
    during submissions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence presented its closing submissions first. During the course
    of those submissions, the trial judge suggested to defence counsel that he had
    violated the rule in <em>Browne v. Dunn</em> (1893), 6 R. 67 (U.K.H.L.), by
    failing to put the appellant’s version of events to the complainant during her
    testimony. Counsel informed the trial judge that this was because he did not
    know that was how his client would testify. The trial judge continued to
    question defence counsel about why he did not put certain questions to the
    complainant. The trial judge suggested that he knew defence counsel to be an
    ethical lawyer, and that it must therefore be the case that the appellant
    testified to a different version of events than counsel expected to hear.
    Counsel, in breach of solicitor-client privilege, confirmed that this was the
    case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge referred to the information
    disclosed to him in breach of solicitor-client privilege as one reason for
    rejecting the appellant’s testimony.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> He explained:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[The rule in Browne v. Dunn is] really a rule of fairness, and
    it’s a well-known rule. All counsel are obliged to follow it. So in the context
    of this case, we know what [the complainant] has said about what happened to
    her. She was cross-examined very well, by an experienced and well-prepared
    lawyer, and in the course of that cross-examination a very well-prepared lawyer
    never said to her that she had been slapped. He never put to her that she had
    said “what are you talking about?” when you had said to her “where are your
    friends now?”</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[…]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Well, if that had actually occurred, then it would demonstrate
    that she could hear, and she was responding to you, so it was an important
    point in the trial. It wasn’t put to her. The reason it wasn’t put to her was
    because your lawyer didn’t know, and that is one of the very rare instances
    where this rule of Browne and Dunn causes me as a judge to say “I can’t rely as
    much on the evidence of Mr. Olusoga.” The legal term for it is drawing an
    adverse inference, but the reality of it is simply saying “look, if this guy
    hasn’t told his own lawyer what he’s going to say on the stand, how much weight
    can I give it?” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge went on to say that the adverse inference he drew based on <em>Browne
    v. Dunn</em> was “not determinative in the context of this case” because there
    were several reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence, <span lang=EN-US>including
    that it did not accord with the DNA evidence tendered by the Crown</span>. He
    went on to explain why he accepted the complainant’s evidence, and why he was
    left without a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt in all the
    circumstances of the case.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Argument and Analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Duty counsel advances one ground of appeal: the breach of
    solicitor-client privilege that followed the trial judge’s questions about the
    rule in </span><em>Browne v. Dunn</em><span lang=EN-US>, and the trial judge’s
    use of that information in finding the appellant guilty, constitutes a
    miscarriage of justice: see </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>.
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 683(1)(a)(iii). It is immaterial, he contends, that
    the information that was improperly disclosed to the trial judge and the
    adverse inference he drew based on that information were not essential to his
    findings of guilt. Duty counsel submits that the appearance of unfairness in
    this case is so severe that the appeal must be allowed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>Counsel for the Crown takes the position that the appeal should be
    dismissed because the information disclosed to the trial judge in breach of
    solicitor-client privilege had no impact on his decision to reject the
    appellant’s testimony. Counsel notes that the trial judge gave several proper
    reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence. Further, the trial judge
    explicitly stated that the adverse inference he drew – purportedly relying on
    the rule in </span><em>Browne v. Dunn</em><span lang=EN-US> – was not
    determinative in rejecting the appellant’s testimony. The Crown contends that
    there was accordingly no prejudice or unfairness, and that the appeal should be
    dismissed: see </span><em>R. v. Pomanti</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2017 ONCA 48, at
    para. 10; </span><em>R. v. A.K.</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2018 ONCA 567, at paras.
    8-9.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>We agree with duty counsel that the appeal must be allowed and a new
    trial ordered. It is well-established that “a miscarriage of justice need not
    always be supported by the demonstration of actual prejudice to an appellant;

lang=EN-US>That is precisely what happened in this case. Regardless of whether
    it was “determinative” in finding the appellant guilty, the trial judge’s use
    of the information disclosed to him in breach of solicitor-client privilege
    created an appearance of unfairness that rises to the level of a miscarriage of
    justice. The appearance of unfairness in this case requires that the appeal be
    allowed, the convictions set aside, and a new trial ordered. In these
    circumstances, the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span

    rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> in his reasons for conviction. It is unnecessary
    to address that error, since the breach of solicitor-client privilege that
    followed the trial judge’s line of questioning and used by the trial judge to
    find the appellant guilty constituted a miscarriage of justice, which itself
    requires appellate intervention.</p>
