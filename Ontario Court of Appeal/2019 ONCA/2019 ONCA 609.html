  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Patrick J. Monahan
    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 14, 2018, with reasons
    reported at 2018 ONSC 966.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Brown J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>I.        OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At issue on this appeal are two components of
    the damages awarded in respect of incentive plan compensation to the respondent
    employee, James Anthony Manastersky, in his wrongful dismissal action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Manastersky was employed by the appellant,
    RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (“RBCDS”), in its RBC Capital Partners unit. For
    ease of reference, I will refer to both as RBCDS. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At trial, RBCDS conceded that it terminated the
    employment of Mr. Manastersky without cause. The trial judge found that Mr.
    Manastersky was entitled to 18 months’ notice upon termination. RBCDS does not
    appeal that finding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During his employment, Mr. Manastersky
    participated in profit-sharing plans called “carried interest plans”. From late
    2004 until his termination in 2014, Mr. Manastersky participated in the
    Mezzanine Carried Interest Plan (the “Mezzanine CIP”). The trial judge awarded
    Mr. Manastersky: (i) the sum of $953,392.50 in respect of “the lost opportunity
    to earn entitlements under” the Mezzanine CIP during the 18-month reasonable
    notice period: Judgment, para. 5; and (ii) the amount of $190,789.00 in respect
    of Mr. Manastersky’s share of investment proceeds under the Mezzanine CIP for
    the period 2005 to 2013, as calculated using Mr. Manastersky’s foreign exchange
    methodology: Judgment, para. 6. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>RBCDS appeals both awards.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons set out below, I would allow the
    appeal in respect of the award of damages for lost opportunity and set aside
    para. 5 of the Judgment. I would dismiss the appeal in respect of the award
    concerning the foreign exchange methodology.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify;
line-height:150%'>II.       <span lang=EN-US>THE MEZZANINE CIP ENTITLEMENTS </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This ground of appeal concerns whether Mr. Manastersky
    was entitled during the period of reasonable notice to payments under the
    Mezzanine CIP beyond those he received in respect of the portfolios in the RBC
    CP Mezzanine Fund (the “Mezzanine Fund”) in existence at the time of his
    termination: Funds 1 and 2. To place the issue in context, I will first review
    in some detail the evidence concerning Mr. Manastersky’s employment and the
    carried interest plans that formed part of his contract of employment. I will
    then consider the errors that RBCDS contends the trial judge made in awarding
    damages for lost opportunity.</span></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    contract of employment</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2001, Mr. Manastersky was recruited to work
    as a director for the Mezzanine Fund. The Mezzanine Fund managed by RBCDS was
    designed to make investments in established companies with a track record of
    positive cash flow, secured by subordinated debt with some form of equity
    participation such as warrants or conversion rights. The funds invested largely
    originated with the Royal Bank of Canada (the “Bank”) as investing principal.
    The average term to maturity of Mezzanine Fund investments would be 5 to 7
    years. As a director of the Fund, Mr. Manastersky was expected to source
    investment opportunities, perform appropriate due diligence and strategic
    analysis, and successfully close transactions. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The initial carried interest plan</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The May 17, 2001 RBC Offer of Employment that
    Mr. Manastersky accepted and signed stated that his base salary initially would
    start at $200,000 per year and he would participate in a discretionary bonus
    pool determined annually. As well, it confirmed that Mr. Manastersky had been
    allocated points as a participant in a carried interest incentive plan which,
    at the time, was the Royal Bank Capital Partners Carried Interest Plan (the
    “2000 Plan”):</span></p>
  <p class=StrongUnderline><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Carried Interest Plan</span></strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>You have been provided with a copy of the RBCP
    Carried Interest Plan. We confirm that you will be allocated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>1) 26.25 points in the 2001 Mezzanine Sector
    Pool; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>2) 1.75 points in the 2001 Shared Pool</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Allocations for the fiscal 2002 Sector and
    Shared Pools will be completed in September 2001. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After starting his employment, Mr. Manastersky
    received letters from RBC advising him of the points he had been awarded in the
    2000 Plan for each of the years 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. Each letter stated
    that the award of points for a year did not constitute any agreement or
    commitment by RBC “to award the same amount of points or any points at all in
    the future or for future years”.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The 2004 and 2006 Mezzanine CIPs</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In late 2003, RBCDS decided to reduce the number
    of sector funds in which it was investing. However, it continued its
    investments in the Mezzanine Fund. To reflect that business shift, in November
    2004 RBC revised the profit-sharing mechanism available to employees managing the
    Mezzanine Fund by establishing the Mezzanine CIP. Certain terms of the
    Mezzanine CIP were amended in December 2006, to which Mr. Manastersky agreed in
    writing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One purpose of the Mezzanine CIP was to incent
    the participating employees to maximize returns to RBCDS on its investment
    portfolio. The CIP entitled participating employees to receive incentive
    compensation payments “computed with reference to the net cash profits and fees
    resulting from [RBCDS’] investment activities”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar><span lang=EN-US>The concept of
    “Investment Periods</span></span><span lang=EN-US>”: Under the Mezzanine CIP, investments
    made by the Bank and managed by RBCDS in the Mezzanine Fund were placed into
    portfolios established for defined “Investment Periods”. The first portfolio
    covered an Initial Investment Period running from November 1, 2004 until
    December 15, 2006: the Fund 1 Investment Period, or Fund 1. Investments made in
    the subsequent Investment Period were known as the Fund 2 Investment Period, or
    Fund 2. The Fund 2 Investment Period would end when that fund had accumulated investments
    totaling $160 million. When the Fund 2 Investment Period ended, the Mezzanine CIP
    contemplated a possible Fund 3 Investment Period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=EmphasisStrongChar><span lang=EN-US>The allocation of
    points in an Investment Period fund</span></span><span lang=EN-US>: All
    full-time employees of RBCDS were eligible to participate in the Mezzanine CIP,
    but no employee was entitled as of right to participate. The decision as to
    which employees would participate lay in the hands of a management committee.
    When a person became entitled to participate, the committee would issue the
    participant an allocation letter that established the participant’s points in
    the Mezzanine CIP. Section 4.4 of the Plan stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Status as a Participant with respect to any
    Investment Period </span><em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>shall not give
    any Participant the express or implied right</span></u></em><span lang=EN-US> to continued employment by the Bank, RBCP or any of the Bank’s subsidiaries </span><em><u><span
style='font-style:normal'>or to any</span> </u></em><em><u><span
style='font-style:normal'>Points for any future Investment Period</span></u></em><span
lang=EN-US>. [emphasis added]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Under the Mezzanine CIP, a participant was
    granted points “[w]ith respect to each Portfolio relating to a given Investment
    Period.” Those points represented the participant’s “share of the portion of
    the aggregate profits and losses of [RBCDS] with respect to that Portfolio”. Points
    were not allocated to a participant on an annual basis. The points allocated to
    Mr. Manastersky for Funds 1 and 2 were set out in schedules to the 2004 and
    2006 Mezzanine CIPs. In connection with any Investment Period after the Fund 2
    Investment Period, art. 6.1.3 of the Mezzanine Plan stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In connection with each Investment Period
    thereafter, RBCP will deliver to each Participant who is granted Points for the
    Portfolio applicable to such Investment Period Allocation Letters, dated on or
    about the date on which such Investment period commences, setting forth such
    Participant’s Points for each such Portfolio.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An RBC letter dated October 18, 2007, and signed
    by Mr. Manastersky, confirmed that he had been allocated 56.25 points in
    respect of the Fund 1 Investment Period and 50 points for the Fund 2 Investment
    Period. The letter stated that the CIP would otherwise remain in full force and
    effect. The letter continued: “Nothing herein shall restrict the ability of the
    Management Committee to modify the CIP, provided such changes do not negatively
    affect your interest in the Fund 1 and Fund 2 Investment Periods.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is no dispute that at the time of his
    termination, Mr. Manastersky’s points were fully vested. When the employment of
    a participant was terminated without cause, the participant continued as a
    participant, retaining “in all Portfolios with respect to which he or she has
    Points, all rights represented by his or her Vested Points.”</span></p>

    in the Mezzanine CIP did not receive annual profit-sharing payments. Whereas
    the investment periods under the 2000 Plan were annual periods, the 2004 and
    2006 Mezzanine CIPs provided for Investment Periods based on the cumulative
    dollar amount of investments made in the given investment period. The timing of
    profit-sharing payments to participants was tied to the end of an Investment
    Period, such as the end of the Fund 1 Investment Period or the Fund 2
    Investment Period. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Article 7.1 of the Plan provided, in part, that

    the end of the Fiscal Year in which an Investment Period ends</span>, and
    semi-annually thereafter on June 15 and December 15 … to the extent such

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By mid-2013, Mr. Manastersky was advised that
    RBCDS was reconsidering its continued reinvestment in the Mezzanine Fund. In an
    October 2013 presentation, Mr. Manastersky canvassed the possible termination
    of the Mezzanine CIP and moving the RBCDS Mezzanine Fund team into the Bank’s
    client services group. He noted that a pending transaction would effectively
    bring the Fund 2 Investment Period to an end and that the Fund’s portfolio
    would mature naturally over the next three years.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This decision formed the background to the
    January 21, 2014 offer to Mr. Manastersky to join the Bank as Managing
    Director, Mezzanine Finance, National Client Group. The compensation offered
    included payment of an annual incentive but not participation in a carried
    interest plan similar to the Mezzanine CIP. Mr. Manastersky expressed
    disappointment with the offer. Some further discussions took place. They did
    not prove fruitful from his perspective. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Manastersky that his employment would end effective Friday, February 14, 2014. The
    termination letter offered to pay Mr. Manastersky his base salary, bonus
    payments and benefit entitlements for a period of 13 months, or until March 15,
    2015. The letter also provided the option of retiring immediately and receiving
    a lump sum payment. With respect to the Mezzanine CIP, the termination letter stated
    that, “[y]our rights and interests in respect of the RBC Capital Partners
    mezzanine fund carried interest plan remain fully vested and all payments to
    which you may ultimately be entitled, if any, will be determined by and
    distributed in accordance with the terms of the plan.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In June 2014, the Bank began making mezzanine
    investments through its Mezzanine Finance, National Client Group. In a June 25,
    2014 memorandum, RBCDS sought formal approval from the Mezzanine CIP’s Management
    Committee to wind-down Funds 1 and 2 and “to approve the termination of the
    Plan in respect of all future Investment Periods pursuant to Article 9.3 of the
    Plan.” The memo noted that RBCDS was in the process of winding down the
    portfolio through the maturity and repayment of the underlying loans in both
    funds. RBCDS advised that it did not intend to make any further investments in
    respect of the portfolio. RBCDS sought to terminate the Plan “to ensure no new
    investment periods are permitted to commence automatically as currently
    contemplated by the Plan.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Approval was granted. Funds 1 and 2 were

    his entitlement under the Mezzanine CIP from Fund investments made between 2005

    which the trial judge found Mr. Manastersky was entitled ran from February 2014
    until August 2015. During that period, RBCDS proceeded to wind-down Funds 1 and
    2 and distribute the proceeds of distribution in accordance with the priorities
    established by the Mezzanine CIP. Mr. Manastersky received his full share of
    the profits realized upon the disposition of Funds 1 and 2. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that Mr. Manastersky was
    entitled to an amount beyond the full share of profits he had been paid in
    respect of Funds 1 and 2. He awarded Mr. Manastersky the sum of $953,392.50 “in
    respect of the lost opportunity to earn entitlements under [the Mezzanine CIP]

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>RBCDS contends that although the trial judge
    began his analysis of the issue by citing the correct legal principles, he
    misapplied those principles to the facts of the case. In its view, since Mr.
    Manastersky received all the profits he was entitled to in respect of Funds 1
    and 2, and as under the terms of the Mezzanine CIP the managing committee was
    under no obligation to start up a new Fund 3 Investment Period, Mr. Manastersky
    did not lose any opportunity to earn further entitlements under the Mezzanine CIP,
    which was the contractual basis for his entitlement to incentive plan
    compensation during his employment.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On his part, Mr. Manastersky takes the position
    that the trial judge properly interpreted his contract of employment and
    applied the governing jurisprudence, so this court should not interfere with
    his award. In his view, the surrounding circumstances of his employment
    relationship and all of the other evidence clearly illustrated that if RBCDS
    terminated the Mezzanine CIP, it would have to be replaced by another carried
    interest plan or comparable form of compensation. He submits that an employer
    cannot take advantage of the discontinuance of a part or function of its
    business to avoid payment to an employee of compensation tied to production of
    that function during the notice period.</span></p>

    principles are those set out in three decisions of this court: <em>Taggart v.
    Canada Life Assurance Co.</em>, [2006] O.J. No. 310 (C.A.); <em>Lin v. Ontario
    Teachers’ Pension Plan Board</em>, 2016 ONCA 619, 402 D.L.R. (4th) 325; and <em>Paquette
    v. TeraGo Networks In</em>c., 2016 ONCA 618, 352 O.A.C. 1. The <em>Lin</em> and <em>Paquette</em> decisions were decided by the same panel and released the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The analysis in each of the three decisions
    proceeded from the general principle that where an employer terminates an
    employee without cause, the employer is liable for damages for breach of
    contract, measured by the loss of wages or salary and other benefits that would
    have been earned during the reasonable notice period: <em>Taggart</em>, at
    para. 13; <em>Lin</em>, at para. 84; <em>Paquette</em>, at para. 16. A
    terminated employee is entitled to a common law claim for damages for the loss
    of pension benefits that would have accrued or he would have earned had the
    employee worked until the end of the notice period: <em>Taggart</em>, at paras.
    13 and 20. A similar approach applies in the case of bonuses or incentive
    payments that are an integral part of the employee’s compensation: <em>Lin</em>,
    at para. 86</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When considering a claim by a terminated
    employee for damages in respect of benefits payable under such plans during the
    period of reasonable notice, <em>Taggart </em>describes the two-step inquiry a
    court should undertake: (i) first, consider the employee’s common law right to
    damages for breach of contract; and then (ii) consider whether the terms of the
    plan alter or remove a common law right: at para. 12.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As to the first step of the inquiry, although <em>Taggart</em> stated that a terminated employee’s claim “is not for pension benefits but
    rather for damages as compensation for the pension benefits he lost as a result
    of the appellant’s termination of his employment contract,” the decision
    explained that the claim “is for common law contract damages as compensation <em><u><span
style='font-style:normal'>for the pension benefits the respondent would have
    earned had the appellant not breached the contract of employment</span></u></em>”
    [emphasis added]: at paras. 11 and 16. The proper measure of damages reflects
    the employer’s obligation “to pay damages that place the employee in the
    position that he or she would have been in had the contract been performed”: <em>Taggart</em>,
    at para. 16. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once a court determines on the evidence what
    benefits the employee would have earned had the employer not breached the
    contract of employment, the employee is entitled to claim damages for loss of
    those common law rights unless there is some contractual term limiting the
    employee’s common law right. This is the focus of the second step of the <em>Taggart</em> analysis. As put by <em>Taggart</em> in respect of pension plans, a court must
    ascertain whether there is anything in the pension plan at issue “capable of
    depriving the [employee] of his common law right to damages for the loss of the
    pension benefits that <em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>he would have earned
    during the notice period</span></u></em>” [emphasis added]: at para. 15. As to
    bonus plans that contain entitlement terms placing limitations on or conditions
    for the payment of a bonus, the question is whether the wording of the bonus
    plan was sufficient to limit the employee’s common law right to receive
    compensation for lost bonuses during the period of reasonable notice and
    whether any limiting language was brought to the attention of the employee and
    formed part of his or her contract of employment: <em>Lin</em>, at para. 86; <em>Paquette</em>,
    at paras. 18 and 46.</span></p>

    respect of the Mezzanine CIP as one for payment in lieu of lost participation
    in the CIP during the period of reasonable notice, using an annual rate of
    payment of $1,053,735. In assessing that claim, the trial judge undertook the
    first step in the <em>Taggart </em>analysis: determining the employee’s common
    law right to damages for breach of contract: at para. 38. However, in this part
    of his analysis, the trial judge focused exclusively on the materiality or
    magnitude of payments made under the Mezzanine CIP in relation to Mr.
    Manastersky’s overall compensation. He held that payments under the RBCDS
    carried interest plans “represented an integral part of Manastersky’s
    compensation”: at para. 39. In the trial judge’s view, “the CIP was a
    significant, nondiscretionary variable form of compensation that represented
    more than half of Manastersky’s annual income, similar to the variable forms of
    incentive compensation considered [in <em>Lin</em>]. It was integral to his
    compensation and therefore forms part of his presumptive entitlement to damages
    at common law during the notice period”: at para. 41.&nbsp;</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>RBCDS submits that although the trial judge correctly
    identified the applicable analysis as that set out in <em>Taggar</em>t, the
    first step of his inquiry incorrectly framed the question to be asked. Instead
    of asking what Mr. Manastersky would have earned in respect of the Mezzanine
    CIP had RBCDS not breached the contract of employment, the trial judge wrongfully
    concluded that Mr. Manastersky was presumptively entitled to common law damages
    in respect of the Mezzanine CIP merely because the payments under that Plan
    historically had constituted a significant form of compensation to him. RBCDS
    contends that the trial judge erred by failing to ask and answer the proper
    question under the first step of the <em>Taggart</em> analysis.</span></p>

    compensation was an integral part of the employee’s compensation package does
    not exhaust the inquiry under the first step of the <em>Taggart</em> analysis.
    It only recognizes that a head of damages is available to a terminated employee
    if he can demonstrate that he would have earned that form of compensation
    during the period of reasonable notice. That commonly occurs, for example,
    where an employee can point to a history of receiving annual performance
    bonuses: see, for example: <em>Paquette</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,

lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It remains the case, however, that when applying
    the <em>Taggart</em> approach to a claim for a form of incentive compensation, a
    court must inquire into the terms of the incentive compensation plan, which may
    contain eligibility criteria or establish a formula for the calculation of the incentive
    compensation: <em>Paquette</em>, at para. 18.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first step of the <em>Taggart </em>analysis therefore
    required the trial judge to ascertain whether Mr. Manastersky had a common law
    right to damages for breach of contract in respect of incentive compensation
    related to the Mezzanine CIP. That required the trial judge to determine what Mr.
    Manastersky would have earned under the Mezzanine CIP had RBCDS performed the
    contract of employment and provided him with 18-months’ notice of termination.
    That, in turn, required the trial judge to examine the terms of the Mezzanine
    CIP as part of the first step in the <em>Taggart </em>analysis. The trial judge
    failed to do so and thereby fell into error, ignoring key provisions of the
    Mezzanine CIP relating to what Mr. Manastersky would have earned during the
    notice period.</span></p>

    of another type of incentive plan.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I do not believe that the fact that RBC had
    the option of terminating the Plan at the end of an investment period should be
    regarded as limiting Manastersky’s entitlement to notice at common law. First,
    RBC’s right to terminate the CIP was in no way tied to the termination of
    Manastersky’s employment. Far from containing “clear language” limiting rights
    upon termination of employment, </span><span class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span
style='font-style:normal'>the provision in the CIP permitting RBC to terminate
    the Plan did not purport to limit or reduce his common law entitlements</span>.</span><span
lang=EN-US> Nor could it be said that the parties did not turn their minds to
    the consequences flowing from the termination of Manastersky’s employment on
    his entitlements under the CIP. In fact, the CIP enhanced Manastersky’s
    entitlements in the event his employment was terminated without cause, through
    accelerated vesting of his Points. [emphasis added]</span></p>

    that provision, when read with other provisions in the Mezzanine CIP, set the
    parameters on Mr. Manastersky’s common law entitlement to incentive payments
    during the period of reasonable notice. Respectfully, the trial judge failed to
    read that provision – Art. 9.3 – in the context of the contract as a whole,

    respect of some new Fund 3 that RBCDS should have set up under the Mezzanine CIP.
    Yet, by awarding Mr. Manastersky damages for earnings beyond those relating to
    Funds 1 and 2, the trial judge effectively was holding that RBCDS was obligated

  <p class=CQuote>What if Manastersky’s employment had continued past February
    14, 2014 and in June 2014 RBC had terminated the CIP without offering
    Manastersky some alternate, comparable form of compensation? Although
    consistent with the terms of the CIP, this would have amounted to a unilateral
    significant reduction in his compensation, as it would have eliminated the
    opportunity for him to continue to accrue entitlements through the CIP. This
    would in all likelihood have amounted to a constructive dismissal, thereby
    triggering an entitlement to damages at common-law, including damages for the

    v. New Brunswick Legal Aid Services Commission</em>, 2015 SCC 10, [2015] 1
    S.C.R. 500, at para. 30. The termination of the Mezzanine CIP did not involve

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, although Mr. Manastersky is not a
    chartered professional accountant, he had decades of experience making and
    managing investments. That experience provided a firm basis for the trial
    judge’s acceptance of Mr. Manastersky’s evidence about the appropriate foreign
    exchange methodology for the investments that he had managed, especially given
    his unchallenged evidence that the methodology had been used by RBCDS to
    calculate payments out to participants under the 2000 Plan. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, the trial judge did not improperly allow
    evidence of surrounding circumstances and the parties’ subjective intentions to
    rewrite the words of the Mezzanine CIP. The evidence was clear: the Mezzanine
    CIP was silent on the issue of the appropriate foreign exchange methodology.
    Simply put, there was no contractual term to rewrite.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the trial judge’s conclusion that it
    was not fair or appropriate for RBCDS, after the fact, to seek to apply a
    methodology that had the effect of exposing participants to significant foreign
    exchange risk was firmly supported by the evidence. The Mezzanine CIP was
    silent on the issue of the applicable foreign exchange methodology. Consequently,
    by imposing the “exit rate” methodology on the calculation of payments to Mr.
    Manastersky in respect of Funds 1 and 2, RBCDS in effect was amending the CIP
    in a material way, as well as departing from the methodology it had used in
    making payments out under the 2000 Plan. Article 9.2.1 of the Mezzanine CIP
    required the written consent of a participant to any change that “may
    materially and adversely affect the determination of any amount to be paid to
    any Participant in respect of any Investment Period which has already
    commenced.” Mr. Manastersky did not consent to using the “exit rate”
    methodology. Consequently, the trial judge’s conclusion on this point found
    firm support in the language of the Mezzanine CIP.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading>Decision of the Trial Judge</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge accurately described the issue and the positions of
    the parties at paras. 26-27 of the reasons:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[<a name=par26>26</a>]    The
    Termination Offer provided that Manastersky’s entitlements under the CIP
    remained fully vested and all payments to which he was entitled would be
    distributed in accordance with the terms of the Plan. However, although RBC
    compensated Manastersky for amounts he had earned from investments made up
    until the date of his termination, they did not compensate him for additional
    amounts that he might have earned from Mezzanine Fund investments that might
    have been made had he remained employed during the notice period.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[<a name=par27>2</a>7]    RBC
    maintains that it was not required to provide any such compensation due to the
    terms of the CIP itself. In particular, RBC maintains that at the time of the
    termination of Manastersky’s employment, it was entitled to terminate the CIP
    in respect of future investment periods. Therefore, RBC maintains, since it
    could have terminated the CIP at the time of Manastersky’s dismissal, it was
    not required to compensate him for amounts that he might have earned from
    future investments. Manastersky, on the other hand, argues that the CIP was a
    fundamental component of his compensation and that RBC was required to
    compensate him for the lost opportunity to accrue additional entitlements under
    the CIP during the notice period.</p>

    examined the RBC Capital Partners Mezzanine Fund (the “Mezzanine Fund” or the

    Fund, operated as a profit-sharing vehicle for those employees who were

    offered a “highly attractive compensation package, including base salary,
    annual performance bonus <u>and participation in the [F]und’s carried interest</u>”
    (emphasis added). The respondent’s participation in the Plan was provided for

    points in the Fund that were allocated to the respondent over his years of
    employment, from June 2001 to February 2014. He noted that while the allocation
    of a specific number of points was discretionary, the respondent’s points had
    remained constant since 2007 when he received 50% of the available points for
    all employees. Over the course of his 13 years of employment with RBC, the
    respondent’s CIP share represented well over 50% of his total annual earnings.
    The trial judge referred to <i>Bain</i><i> </i>(ONSC) for the general test for
    determining whether a bonus is an integral part of an employee’s compensation.
    One element of that test is whether the employee received a bonus every year: <i>Bain</i><i> </i>(ONSC), at para. 83.</span></p>

    entitlement formed an integral part of the respondent’s compensation, the trial
    judge took into account the following contextual factors: it formed part of his
    contract; he participated throughout his 13 years of employment; although the
    points allocation was discretionary, his had remained constant since 2007; and
    his CIP entitlement represented over 50% of his annual income. The trial judge
    concluded, at para. 41:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>In short, the CIP was a
    significant, nondiscretionary variable form of compensation that represented
    more than half of Manastersky’s annual income, similar to the variable forms of
    incentive compensation considered by Corbett J. in [<i>Lin v. Ontario Teachers’
    Pension Plan Board</i>, 2015 ONSC 3494, at paras. 92-94]. It was integral to
    his compensation and therefore forms part of his presumptive entitlement to

    second component of the test: whether the terms of the CIP altered or removed
    the respondent’s common law right to damages on termination of his employment.
    He noted, relying on the jurisprudence of this court, that clear language is
    required to limit common law entitlements. He focused on the fact that the CIP
    specifically addressed what would happen on termination of employment by
    providing for accelerated vesting of the respondent’s points in the CIP. It did
    not purport to reduce or limit the respondent’s entitlement. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'><span
style='line-height:100%'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge then addressed the
    argument, which is renewed on appeal and which my colleague accepts, that
    because the Plan provided that RBC could terminate the CIP at the end of any
    investment period, RBC was entitled to eliminate the respondent’s ability to
    earn CIP during his employment, which in turn constituted a limitation on the
    respondent’s right to have the CIP be considered part of his compensation
    package and presumptive common law entitlement on termination. The trial judge
    rejected that argument, as follows:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[43]    RBC argued that
    Manastersky was not entitled to compensation in respect of the CIP during the
    common law notice period by virtue of a provision which allowed RBC to
    “terminate the Plan effective as of the end of any Investment Period with
    respect to future Investment Periods.” As noted earlier, by the fall 2013, the
    CIP was nearing the end of the investment period for Fund 2, by virtue of the
    fact that the total amount invested through the Mezzanine Fund was approaching
    $160 million. Upon the conclusion of the Fund 2 investment period, a new
    investment period would automatically begin. However, RBC could also elect to
    terminate the CIP with respect to future investment periods upon the conclusion
    of the Fund 2 investment period and prior to the commencement of Fund 3. In
    fact, RBC exercised this right on June 25, 2014, when it terminated the CIP in
    respect of future investment periods.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[44]    I do not believe that the
    fact that RBC had the option of terminating the Plan at the end of an
    investment period should be regarded as limiting Manastersky’s entitlement to
    notice at common law. First, RBC’s right to terminate the CIP was in no way
    tied to the termination of Manastersky’s employment. Far from containing “clear
    language” limiting rights upon termination of employment, the provision in the
    CIP permitting RBC to terminate the Plan did not purport to limit or reduce his
    common law entitlements. Nor could it be said that the parties did not turn
    their minds to the consequences flowing from the termination of Manastersky’s
    employment on his entitlements under the CIP. In fact, the CIP enhanced
    Manastersky’s entitlements in the event his employment was terminated without
    cause, through accelerated vesting of his Points.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>[45]    Further, the fact that
    RBC terminated the CIP in respect of future investment periods on June 25,
    2014, four months after Manastersky’s dismissal without cause, does not alter
    this analysis. As Sharpe JA explained in <i>Taggart</i>, in cases where a
    terminated employee seeks compensation for entitlements under a benefit plan,
    the claim is not for the benefits themselves. Rather, the claim is for common
    law contract damages as compensation for the benefits that the employee would
    have earned had the employer not breached the contract of employment. The
    employee is claiming for the lost opportunity to continue to earn or receive
    benefits that would have been available in the event their employment had
    continued. As of the date of the Termination Offer, RBC had not in fact
    terminated the CIP, and it therefore remained in place as an integral component
    of Manastersky’s compensation.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='background:white'>[<a
name=par46>46</a>]    What if Manastersky’s employment had continued past
    February 14, 2014 and in June 2014 RBC had terminated the CIP without offering
    Manastersky some alternate, comparable form of compensation? Although
    consistent with the terms of the CIP, this would have amounted to a unilateral
    significant reduction in his compensation, as it would have eliminated the
    opportunity for him to continue to accrue entitlements through the CIP. This
    would in all likelihood have amounted to a constructive dismissal, thereby
    triggering an entitlement to damages at common-law, including damages for the
    lost opportunity to continue to earn entitlements under the CIP.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>My colleague takes issue with the trial judge’s application of the <em>Taggart </em>test. He says the trial judge had to consider the terms of the CIP as part
    of the first step in the <em>Taggart</em> analysis in order to determine the
    respondent’s common law right to damages, and that he erred in law by failing
    to do so. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'><span
style='line-height:100%'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The argument is that the CIP
    contains a limit on the respondent’s common law right to earn CIP during his
    employment, rather than a limit on his right to a bonus or a pension following
    termination, as in <i>Paquette</i> and <i>Taggart</i><i>.</i> In other words,
    because RBC had no obligation to continue the CIP beyond the two existing funds
    or to start a third fund, it could not be said that the respondent would have
    continued to earn CIP during his employment or during the reasonable notice period. </span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'><span
style='line-height:100%'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>I agree with my colleague that, as
    a matter of law, the terms of the employment contract and the terms of any plan
    documents incorporated into the employment contract by reference – as the CIP
    was here – are relevant at the first stage of the <i>Taggart</i><i> </i>test in
    determining what the employee would have earned during the period of reasonable
    notice: see <i>Paquette</i>, at para. 18. </span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:100%'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>However, as I read his reasons,
    the trial judge carefully considered the terms of the CIP in determining
    whether the appellant’s right to terminate the CIP prevented that portion of
    the respondent’s compensation from forming part of his presumptive entitlement
    to common law damages. He made two cogent observations, at para 44: 1) RBC’s
    right to terminate the CIP was in no way tied to the termination of the
    respondent’s employment, and 2) that right did not purport to limit or reduce
    the respondent’s common law entitlements.</span></p>

style='line-height:100%'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge considered the
    appellant’s argument on this point fully at the end of his analysis and
    rejected it. While it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have
    addressed this argument in the part of his reasons where he deals with the
    first stage of the <i>Taggart</i> test, read as a whole, the trial judge’s
    reasons reveal that he properly considered the terms of the relevant documents
    and the applicable law in determining the respondent’s entitlement to damages. </span></p>

style='line-height:100%'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Moreover, I disagree with my
    colleague that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in finding
    that the terms of the CIP did not preclude that component of the respondent’s
    compensation from constituting part of his presumptive common law right to
    damages for breach of contract. </span></p>

    one that is “plainly seen”: <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2
    S.C.R. 235, at paras. 1-6. This standard is met “if the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence in that the findings are ‘clearly wrong’,
    ‘unreasonable’, or not ‘reasonably supported by the evidence’”: <i>RBC Dominion
    Securities Inc. v. Crew Gold Corporation</i>, 2017 ONCA 648, 73 B.L.R. (5th)

style='line-height:100%'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>In my view, the trial judge did
    not make a palpable and overriding error. To the contrary, not only was the
    trial judge’s interpretation of the CIP a reasonable one, in my view it was
    correct. </span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:100%'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge took into account
    all of the history and other contextual factors surrounding the respondent’s
    compensation while employed at RBC in interpreting his common law entitlement.
    As the trial judge found, the provision that allowed RBC to unilaterally
    discontinue the Plan, a particular mechanism of part of the compensation, does
    not contain clear language that has the effect of removing the employee’s right
    to receive compensation in an amount equivalent to what he would have earned
    through that mechanism during the period of reasonable notice: <i>Lin</i>, at
    para. 86 (citing <i>Taggart</i>, at para. 20). </span></p>
  <p style='

style='line-height:100%'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The reason clear language is
    required is to ensure that the employee is bound only by what was understood
    and agreed to. There is no dispute that the respondent understood and agreed
    that the CIP could be terminated by RBC. However, he did not agree as a term of
    his contract that his compensation package would then no longer include
    participation in an incentive plan. Nor was there evidence that it was the intention
    of the parties that the clause that gave RBC the right to terminate the CIP
    would have that effect.</span></p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:100%'><span
style='line-height:100%'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>I agree with the trial judge that
    RBC’s right to discontinue the CIP does not constitute the type of clear
    language that is required to limit an employee’s common law entitlement to
    damages in lieu of notice. It gives the company the business discretion and
    flexibility to continue or discontinue a particular mechanism of compensation
    linked to the company’s investments. It does not speak to the employee’s
    entitlement to receive the level of compensation to which the employee is
    entitled. </span></p>

style='line-height:100%'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>While RBC could terminate the CIP
    pursuant to Article 9.3, it would have been required to offer the respondent an
    alternate comparable form of compensation, because the contract does not
    provide that the effect of the employer’s ability to terminate the CIP is that
    the respondent’s compensation would be unilaterally reduced by that amount, in
    this case about 50%. If RBC had terminated the CIP without offering alternate comparable
    compensation, that would have evinced RBC’s intention to no longer be bound by
    the employment contract and would have amounted to constructive dismissal: <i>Potter
    v. New Brunswick Legal Aid Services Commission</i><i>,</i> 2015 SCC 10, [2015]
    1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 30.</span></p>

    agree, that inclusion of entitlement to the CIP was the product of an agreement
    between a sophisticated employer and a group of sophisticated employees. Had it
    intended to do so, the sophisticated employer in this case could have drafted a
    contractual provision that clearly stated that if it terminated the CIP, then
    the employee’s compensation would be reduced accordingly. </span></p>

style='line-height:100%'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Further, it is difficult to
    imagine a sophisticated employee knowingly agreeing to continue in the position
    if the employer could, in its sole discretion, remove over 50% of the
    employee’s compensation, especially considering the CIP was intended to “assist
    RBC CP in retaining and recruiting talented individuals to carry out its
    business objectives”: Reasons, at para. 7. </span></p>

  <p style='

style='line-height:100%'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>I agree with the trial judge that
    the language of the CIP, and in particular Article 9.3, does not limit the
    respondent’s right to CIP or its equivalent as an integral part of his
    compensation. The trial judge did not err in law or commit a palpable and
    overriding error in his interpretation of the contract. There is therefore no
    basis to interfere with his decision. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</span></p>
