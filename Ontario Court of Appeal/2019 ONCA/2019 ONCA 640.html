  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Barbara Thurston (the respondent) is a sole
    practitioner lawyer who provided legal services to the Office of the Children’s
    Lawyer (the “OCL”) pursuant to a series of agreements over a period of 13 years,
    the last of which expired on March 31, 2015.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The OCL did not renew her retainer following the
    expiry of the last agreement. The respondent brought a claim alleging that she
    was a dependent contractor and was therefore entitled to 20 months’ notice of
    termination. The OCL brought a motion for summary judgment dismissing her claim.
    That motion was dismissed and the OCL appeals.</span></p>

    concluding that the respondent was a dependent contractor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would allow the appeal for the reasons that
    follow.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>BACKGROUND</p>
  <h2>The facts</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent was a member of the OCL Personal
    Rights Panel, one of approximately 380 lawyers retained by the OCL to provide
    legal services in regard to custody, access, and child protection matters. She
    was first appointed to the OCL panel of lawyers in 2002, for a two-year period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent remained a member of the OCL panel
    for the next 13 years pursuant to a series of fixed-term contracts, each of
    which required her to apply for reappointment as each contract expired. There
    was no automatic right of renewal for the contracts. However, on each occasion
    she was reappointed to the panel, initially for two-year terms and then from
    2012 on an annual basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent maintained an independent legal
    practice while she was a member of the OCL panel, and that practice formed a
    majority of her billings. Her OCL work accounted for anywhere from a low of 14.8%
    to a high of 62.6% of her annual total billings. Over the 13-year period that
    she was on the OCL panel, OCL billings accounted for an average of 39.9% of her
    annual billings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s last retainer agreement expired
    in 2015. On March 31, 2015, the expiry date of that agreement, the OCL informed
    the respondent that her retainer was not going to be renewed. The respondent
    was given one year to wind down her existing OCL files and was not subsequently
    appointed to the OCL panel. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>The retainer agreement</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s 2012 retainer agreement ran
    until March 31, 2013, but was extended from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014, and
    again from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015. It included the following
    provisions:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The term may be extended or subsequently
    renewed in the discretion of the Children’s Lawyer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>                   …</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>No guarantee of work</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The OCL makes no guarantee of the total value
    or volume of work to be assigned to you. You confirm that in your capacity as
    an OCL agent, you are not an employee of the OCL.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>                   …</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>Termination of Agreement</strong></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>In order to effect an orderly transition, you
    agree to give the OCL sixty days written notice of your intention to resign
    from the OCL panel…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Children’s
    Lawyer, or her designate, reserves the right, at her sole discretion, to
    terminate this retainer agreement at any time, without fault and without
    liability.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge’s decision</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent conceded that she was not an
    employee. The issues before the motion judge were whether the respondent was a
    dependent contractor and, if so, whether she was entitled to reasonable notice
    or payment in lieu of reasonable notice, despite the fixed-term nature of the
    retainer agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge found that the respondent’s
    relationship with OCL was continuous for a 13-year period with no break. During
    that period, the respondent performed the work of the OCL under the OCL’s
    control and was perceived by the public to be an employee of the OCL. An
    average of 39.9% of the respondent’s total billings from her legal practice came
    from the OCL during the period in which she was on the OCL panel, and the trend
    was for an increasingly larger portion of the respondent’s income to come from
    the OCL – reaching a high of 62.6% in 2012-2013, though dropping to 50% in the
    final year in which she was retained. In brief reasons, the motion judge
    concluded that these factors were sufficient to “tip the balance” in favour of
    a finding of dependent contractor status. In particular, the motion judge noted
    the permanence of the respondent’s relationship with the OCL, the fact that she
    performed work that is integral to the OCL, and the public perception that she
    was an OCL lawyer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge rejected the OCL’s alternative
    position that there was no obligation to provide notice or payment in lieu of
    notice at the expiry of a fixed-term agreement. She distinguished the cases
    proffered in support of the OCL’s position on the basis that the respondent’s
    contract was renewed for 13 years, without break in service, in addition to the
    factors outlined above. The motion judge dismissed the OCL’s motion for summary
    judgment and seized herself of the trial of the notice and damages issues. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>Jurisdiction to hear the appeal</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A preliminary issue arose concerning whether the
    appeal was properly before this court – in particular, whether the motion judge
    had made a final order concerning the respondent’s status as a dependent
    contractor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The order dismissing the appellant’s motion for
    summary judgment includes the following provisions:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>THIS COURT ORDERS
    that the OCL had not met its burden of proof that Ms. Thurston was an
    independent contractor. Ms. Thurston was a dependent contractor.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>THIS COURT ORDERS
    that findings of fact in relation to this motion, as stated in the Court’s Endorsement,
    dated June 27, 2018, were intended to be binding on the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>THIS COURT ORDERS
    that the remaining issues for trial are the appropriate notice and damages, if
    any, to be awarded to Ms. Thurston.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>THIS COURT ORDERS
    that the Honourable Madam Justice Pollak shall remain seized of the trial,
    provided the trial can be scheduled in a timely and expeditious manner without
    adverse delay or consequences to the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='background:white'>The wording of the order followed
    an exchange between counsel and the motion judge, after counsel for the
    appellant had taken the view that the motion judge had, in her endorsement,
    made no findings of fact or law in dismissing the motion for summary judgment,
    and that all issues were to be determined at trial. Counsel wrote to the court
    seeking clarification on the nature of her decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge’s assistant replied on behalf
    of the motion judge in an email dated August 8, 2018. The parties were informed
    that “on the issues put before the Court, findings of fact were made and
    intended to be binding on the parties. … The reference to there being no
    genuine issue for trial refers to the fact that the Court was able to make a
    decision with respect to the only issue put before the Court by the parties –
    that is the Plaintiff’s status on the basis of the record before it.” The only remaining
    issues concerned “the appropriate notice and damages to be awarded” to the
    respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am satisfied that the motion judge’s
    clarification confirms that she made a conclusive finding on the dependent
    contractor issue. This was the issue on which the motion depended. Although r.
    20.04(4) of the </span><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, is not cited in the email clarification, the rule was put to the
    motion judge by counsel for the appellant, her response is clear, and there is
    no doubt that the motion judge intended her determination to be binding on the
    parties at trial: </span><em>Skunk v. Ketash</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2016 ONCA
    841, 135 O.R. (3d) 180, at para. 58.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, this appeal is from a final order
    of a judge of the Superior Court of Justice and is properly before this court.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>The respondent is not a dependent contractor</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given the respondent’s concession that she was
    not an employee of the OCL, it was necessary to determine only whether she was
    a dependent or independent contractor. </span></p>

    relationship in which there is “a certain minimum economic dependency, which
    may be demonstrated by complete or near-complete exclusivity”. “Minimum
    economic dependency” is a vaguely worded standard, and its application yields
    outcomes that are highly context-specific: </span><em>McKee</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 38. It follows that a judge’s decision as to the nature
    of a working relationship is generally entitled to deference.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>But the determination as to dependent contractor
    status must be made having regard to the purpose of the concept: the extension
    of the common law entitlement to notice of termination from employees to
    dependent contractors. That extension was justified in <i>McKee</i> on the
    basis that, like employees – and <i>unlike</i> independent contractors –
    dependent contractors are to a large extent economically dependent, albeit on a
    contracting party rather than an employer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In distinguishing dependent from independent
    contractors, <i>McKee</i> made clear that exclusivity of service provision, and
    therefore of income, is key. As the court put it, “exclusivity is </span><em>determinative</em><span
lang=EN-US>, as it demonstrates economic dependence”; exclusivity, the court
    said, is a “hallmark” of the dependent contractor category: <i>McKee</i>, at
    para. 34. In </span><em>Keenan</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 25, this court
    emphasized that exclusivity was “integrally tied to the question of economic
    dependency” and that the determination of exclusivity requires consideration of
    the full history of the relationship in question.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These two cases constitute the primary guidance
    from this court on the issue of distinguishing dependent and independent
    contractors. Since <i>McKee</i> was released in 2009, several lower court
    decisions have interpreted and applied the concept of “exclusivity” to
    determine a contractor’s status. In several cases in which a dependent
    contractor relationship was found to exist, the relationship was absolutely
    exclusive in nature: </span><span lang=EN-US>see, e.g., </span><i><span

    relationship was found to exist but exclusivity was not absolute, substantially
    more than a majority of the dependent contractor’s income was earned from the
    contracting party:<i> </i>see, e.g.,<i> Beattie v. Women College Hospital, </i>2018

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, there is no question that the
    respondent did not work exclusively for the OCL. On the contrary, the OCL
    expected her to maintain a private legal practice throughout the entire time that
    she was retained, and she did so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Putting the respondent’s case at its highest,
    over the course of her retainer an average 39.9% of her annual billings came
    from the OCL. To be sure, that is a significant percentage of the respondent’s
    billing, and the loss of the OCL retainer would have had a substantial impact
    on the respondent’s legal practice and her income. But that is not determinative
    of her status as a dependent contractor. On no account can 39.9% of billings be
    said to constitute exclusivity or “near-complete exclusivity”, such that
    economic dependence on the OCL is established.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Exclusivity is a categorical concept – it poses an
    either/or question, and “near-complete exclusivity” must be understood with
    this in mind. “Near-complete exclusivity” cannot be reduced to a specific
    number that determines dependent contractor status; additional factors may be
    relevant in determining economic dependency. But “near-exclusivity” necessarily
    requires substantially more than 50% of billings. If it were otherwise,
    exclusivity – the “hallmark” of dependent contractor status – would be rendered
    meaningless.</span></p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the OCL reserved the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate

    liability;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the respondent had her own office, supplies, and staff; and</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In short, the OCL was one of the respondent’s
    clients – a very important client, but only one of her clients. The loss of a
    client will be more or less significant to any contractor, but care must be
    taken in applying dependent contractor case law to professionals such as
    lawyers working under retainer agreements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the respondent’s loss of the OCL retainer
    results in a 39.9% reduction in the billings generated by her legal practice.
    That is a significant loss, but it is insufficient to establish the requisite economic
    dependency. As a result, there is no need to consider the appellant’s
    alternative position that any economic dependence was self-induced.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From the OCL’s perspective, the respondent was
    one of many lawyers on retainer across Ontario. The longevity of the
    respondent’s retainer with the OCL did not transform it into a relationship of
    “enduring dependency”, as the respondent submits. The terms of the retainer
    make it plain that the respondent had no entitlement to any minimum level of
    work. Specifically, as noted above, the retainer agreement in place from
    2012-2015 stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The OCL makes no guarantee of the total value
    or volume of work to be assigned to you.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge’s failure to give effect to
    these considerations renders her conclusion that the respondent was a dependent
    contractor unreasonable. The motion judge focused on the work the respondent
    performed for the OCL, noting that the OCL had a great deal of control over her
    work and working conditions and that the public perceived the respondent to be
    an OCL employee. But the OCL did not control the respondent’s work in general,
    and its control over her OCL work was necessary given the nature of the
    relationship that the retainer established and the OCL’s public function. Moreover,
    regardless of any public perception the terms of the contract clearly
    distinguished lawyers on retainer from OCL in-house lawyers. But the key point
    is this: only 39.9% of earnings came from the OCL during the relevant period.
    This cannot reasonably be categorized as a “near-exclusive” relationship
    without changing the nature of the legal test.</span></p>

    could practice children’s law was to do so with the OCL. That may be true, but it
    is irrelevant: the respondent had no entitlement to work in her preferred area
    of practice. She is in no different position than any other lawyer who has lost
    a preferred client. The terms of her retainer made the nature of her
    relationship with the OCL clear.</span></p>
