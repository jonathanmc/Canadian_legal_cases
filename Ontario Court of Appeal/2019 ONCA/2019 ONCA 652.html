    He described himself as making the “ultimate sacrifice” for his partner. The
    appellant told his roommates and others about his HIV status.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After learning that he was HIV positive, the appellant continued to have
    an active sex life. He did not use condoms. He met most of his partners on
    various dating websites. While most of the encounters were casual “one-night
    stands”, some of his texts suggested the appellant was looking for, perhaps
    even desperate for, a more long-term, meaningful relationship. He made similar
    comments to his roommates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant spent time online immersed in what was referred to at the trial as
    the “bug-chasing” culture. This phrase refers to persons who are sexually
    aroused by the idea of infecting others and being infected by others with HIV.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    numerous texts, the appellant bragged about infecting many young men with HIV.
    He referred to his high viral load and his reluctance to take antiretroviral
    drugs because they would make it more difficult for him to infect his partners.
    The appellant also indicated that he routinely lied to his partners about his
    HIV status so they would agree to unprotected anal intercourse. He also
    described how he would deliberately misuse or sabotage condoms to trick his
    partners into thinking they were having protected sex.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s online chats are replete with comments about infecting partners
    with HIV. A sampling is set out below:</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some of the text messages, the appellant spoke of infecting others with HIV and
    getting a biohazard tattoo with his initials and his partner’s initials on the
    tattoo.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the defence argued that the texts were in the main exchanges between
    individuals who frequented certain websites because they would find others who
    were sexually aroused by conversations about being infected with HIV and
    infecting others with HIV. The defence maintained that the conversations were
    fantasy and roleplaying. They were full of comments that were demonstrably
    false. M.B. and J.B., two of the complainants called by the Crown, used these
    websites for exactly that kind of fantasy roleplaying. The defence submitted to
    the jury that most things said on those websites could not safely be relied on
    for their truth, or as indicative of the appellant’s true state of mind.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence did, however, rely on some comments made by the appellant in the texts.
    For example, the defence submitted that the appellant’s comments showed that he
    knew HIV could lead to AIDS, a disease that could be managed and lived with by
    the administration of appropriate drugs. It was not, as it once was, a disease
    that inevitably killed those who suffered from it. The defence submitted that
    these comments were inconsistent with an intention to kill those he infected.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown put forward a different interpretation of the text messages. The Crown
    argued to the jury that the appellant’s repeated statements should be taken at
    face value. He deliberately and repeatedly engaged in very high-risk sexual
    activities, intending to infect his partners with HIV. He lied to those
    partners about his HIV status to achieve that end. The Crown argued that the
    appellant’s text messages showed that he was sexually aroused by, and deeply
    committed to, spreading HIV to his sexual partners. He knew that HIV eventually
    led to AIDS, a fatal disease. He set out to infect others and eventually cause
    their death to satisfy his own perverse sexual desires. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant never expressly indicated he wanted to, or intended to, kill anyone
    in his text messages. However, the Crown contended that the jury could infer
    that intention from repeated statements made in the texts about the desire to
    infect partners, combined with the appellant’s knowledge of the consequences of
    infection.</p>

    was seventeen years old when he met the appellant on the internet in January
    2010. They had unprotected anal sex nine times in late January and early
    February 2010. On each occasion, D.S. was the receptive partner and the
    appellant was the insertive partner. The appellant ejaculated into D.S.’s anus
    on seven occasions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.S.
    learned that the appellant was HIV positive in February and confronted him. The
    appellant initially denied being HIV positive, but later admitted to D.S. that
    he had lied to him about his status.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.S.
    was not HIV positive when he met the appellant. He tested positive for HIV in
    April 2010. D.S. had sexual relations with other men between the end of his
    relationship with the appellant and his positive HIV test. Dr. Remis, after
    examining the details of D.S.’s sexual contacts with others, agreed that it was
    highly likely that the appellant infected D.S.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.S.
    will be on antiretroviral medication for the rest of his life. Dr. Remis cited

    years shorter than that of non-infected individuals.</p>

    defence accepted that the appellant repeatedly had unprotected anal intercourse
    with D.S. and did not reveal his HIV-positive status to D.S. Those facts
    warranted a conviction on the aggravated sexual assault charge (count 1): see <em>R.
    v. Mabior</em>, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584. The appellant has not
    appealed that conviction. He does appeal his convictions on attempted murder

    to meet and have sex. The appellant repeatedly told M.C. that he was “clean”.
    M.C. and the appellant met at the appellant’s home. They had oral sex without
    condoms. Neither ejaculated. The appellant anally penetrated M.C. twice and
    ejaculated into M.C. both times. He was not wearing a condom.</p>

    M.B. contacted the appellant, hoping they could get together for sex. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span

    March 2010, the appellant confirmed to M.B. that he was HIV positive and not
    taking any medication. M.B. lied to the appellant and told him that he thought
    he was HIV negative, but wanted to have unprotected sex. According to M.B., he
    lied to the appellant because he thought the appellant was sexually aroused by
    the idea of infecting others. The appellant had not said anything in his texts
    about wanting to infect M.B.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span

    interview with the police, he falsely claimed that the appellant had not
    disclosed his HIV status to him and that he would not have consented to sex had
    he known the appellant’s status. M.B. acknowledged that he was confronted with
    his lies before he testified at the preliminary inquiry and that he may have
    lied under oath had he not been confronted before the preliminary inquiry with

    penetrated B.C. B.C. insisted that the appellant use a condom. He saw the
    appellant put the condom on before sex and remove it afterward. B.C. could not
    say for sure whether the appellant ejaculated. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span

    was no direct evidence that the appellant somehow compromised the condom he
    used or deliberately misused the condom when he had sex with B.C. The Crown
    argued, however, that many comments made by the appellant in his texts, in
    which he bragged about poking holes in his condoms and tricking his partners
    into thinking he was using a condom, provided evidence from which the jury
    could infer that he used one of those “tricks” after B.C. insisted that he use

  <h1>The Expert Evidence</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two experts, Dr. Remis for the Crown, and Dr. Tyndall for the defence, agreed
    on most matters.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[6]</span></span></span></a> They agreed that HIV is incurable and, if untreated, leads to AIDS which will
    cause death within 10 to 15 years of infection. The arrival of antiretroviral
    drugs in the mid-1990s drastically reduced the mortality rate due to AIDS. With
    the proper use of that medication, HIV is a long-term, manageable illness.
    People with HIV can live healthy lives. However, the drugs are not effective
    for everyone and some people cannot tolerate them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    with drug therapy, HIV reduces life expectancy by 12 years. The younger a
    person is when he or she contracts HIV, the more significant the impact on life
    expectancy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Receptive
    anal sex carries the highest risk of transmission of HIV. Oral sex carries the
    lowest risk. Condoms can reduce the risk of HIV transmission by 80 percent or
    more. If a condom is properly applied and used, the risk reduction is much
    closer to 100 percent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ejaculation
    increases the risk of infection because of the volume of bodily fluid
    containing the virus. Pre-ejaculate also carries some, but a lesser risk of
    infection.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    higher the infected person’s viral load, the greater the risk that a sexual
    partner will be infected with HIV. A low viral load is fewer than 1,500 copies
    per millilitre of blood. The appellant had a high viral load at the relevant
    time of over 50,000 copies per millilitre of blood. He was aware of his high
    viral load and its relationship to the risk of infecting his partners.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    presence of other sexually transmitted diseases increases the risk that an
    infected person will transmit HIV to a sexual partner. The appellant tested
    positive for gonorrhea in May 2009 and again in April 2010.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Remis calculated the risk of transmission of HIV from the appellant to each of
    the complainants based on the sexual activity described by the complainants and
    using a per-act risk taken from different scientific studies. Dr.&nbsp;Remis estimated
    D.S.’s risk at 8.6 percent, M.C.’s risk at 2 percent, B.C.’s risk at 0.2
    percent, and M.B.’s risk, had he not already been infected with HIV, at 2 percent.
    Dr. Tyndall agreed with these estimates.</p>

    appellant was convicted on three counts of attempted murder. Those convictions
    were the main focus of the appeal. The appellant alleges several specific
    errors. Broadly speaking, he contends that the trial judge’s instructions on

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    crime of attempted murder requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    accused intended to kill, coupled with conduct by the accused done for the
    purpose of carrying out that intention. The conduct must amount to “some act
    more than merely preparatory”: <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s.
    24; <em>United States of America v. Dynar</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462, at para.
    50; <em>R. v. Gordon</em>, 2009 ONCA 170, 94 O.R. (3d) 1, at para.&nbsp;56. The
    point at which an accused’s actions pass beyond preparation to the <em>actus reus</em> component of an attempt to commit the crime is difficult to identify in the
    abstract: see Eugene Meehan, Marie-France Major &amp; John H. Currie, <em>The
    Law of Criminal Attempt</em>, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2015), ch. 5. The
    conduct component need not be itself criminal or even unlawful: <em>The Queen
    v. Ancio</em>, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, at p.&nbsp;248; <em>Gordon</em>, at para.
    56; <em>R. v. Colburne</em> (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 235 (Qc. C.A.), at pp.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>actus reus</em> component of the attempted murder charges was not in dispute
    at trial. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that if they were
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had ejaculated into the
    anuses of D.S., M.C. and M.B., that act provided the conduct component of the
    crime of attempted murder. The defence accepted that the appellant had
    unprotected anal intercourse with the three complainants and that he had
    ejaculated into them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    outcome of the attempted murder charges depended on whether the Crown had
    proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the necessary <em>mens
    rea</em> for the offence of attempted murder. The crime of attempted murder
    requires proof of “the specific intent to kill”. The intention to inflict harm,
    even significant harm, combined with recklessness as to the consequence of
    inflicting that harm, does not suffice to establish the <em>mens rea</em> for
    attempted murder: <em>Ancio</em>, at pp. 248-51.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    can it be said that a person intends to kill? Certainly, a person whose purpose
    is to kill another, either as an end in itself or as a means to achieving some
    further end, has the intention to kill. However, and subject to the language of
    the provision creating the offence, courts have extended this everyday
    conception of intention to include the decision to carry out some purpose in
    the knowledge that killing is virtually certain to result, although the killing
    is neither the ultimate purpose in acting, nor the means chosen to achieve the
    desired purpose, and may even be deeply regretted. That is, the law treats as
    intended those side-effects that are foreseen to occur with virtual certainty. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    well-used example of the package on the airplane usefully draws the distinction
    between the two notions of intent. “A” places a bomb on a plane intending that
    it will explode while the plane is in mid-air. He has placed a package on the
    plane and intends to make an insurance claim when the package is destroyed in
    the explosion. “A” also believes, to a virtual certainty, that the persons on
    the plane will die when the bomb explodes, although he does not want them to
    die and actually hopes that they will somehow survive. “A’s” direct intention
    is to defraud his insurer. Whether his state of mind is described in terms of
    accepting the deaths as a regrettable but virtually certain side-effect to
    achieving his actual purpose of defrauding the insurer, or as an oblique or
    indirect intention to kill the occupants of the plane, it is properly
    characterized as intention for the purposes of the criminal law: see Dennis J. Baker, <em>Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law</em>, 4th ed. (London, U.K.:
    Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 2015), at pp. 113-22; Glanville Williams, “Oblique

    this court considered the <em>mens rea</em> requirement on a charge of wilfully
    promoting hatred against an identifiable group. Martin J.A., after examining
    the language of the section and the statutory context, concluded, at p. 381,
    that the word “wilfully” meant “with the intention of”. He proceeded, at pp. 384-85,
    to articulate, with his customary clarity, the dual meaning of intention:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I agree, however (assuming without deciding that there may be
    cases in which intended consequences are confined to those which it is the
    actor’s conscious purpose to bring about), that, as <span class=Underline>a
    general rule, a person who foresees that a consequence is certain or
    substantially certain to result from an act which he does in order to achieve
    some other purpose, intends that consequence</span>. The actor’s foresight of
    the certainty or moral certainty of the consequence resulting from his conduct
    compels a conclusion that if he, none the less, acted so as to produce it, then
    he decided to bring it about (albeit regretfully), in order to achieve his
    ultimate purpose. His intention encompasses the means as well as to his
    ultimate objective.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I conclude, therefore, that the appellants “wilfully”
    (intentionally) promoted hatred against the French Canadian community of Essex
    County only if: <span class=Underline>(a) their conscious purpose in
    distributing the document was to promote hatred against that group, or (b) they
    foresaw that the promotion of hatred against that group was certain or morally
    certain to result from the distribution of the pamphlet</span>…. [Emphasis

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Martin
    J.A.’s formulation of intention as including both purpose and foresight of virtually
    certain consequences was adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>R. v.
    Keegstra</em>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at pp.&nbsp;774-75, also a case involving
    the offence of wilfully promoting hatred. In <em>R. v. Chartrand</em>, [1994] 2
    S.C.R. 864, at pp.&nbsp;889-90, that court again adopted Martin J.A.’s words in
    defining intention in respect of the offence of unlawfully taking a child under
    14 with intent to deprive a parent of possession of that child. L’Heureux-Dubé J.
    defined the phrase “with intent to” in this way, at p. 414: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>General principles of <em>mens rea</em> apply to the words
    “with intent to”, and, accordingly, in order to conclude that the <em>mens rea</em> of the offence under s. 281 has been made out, it is sufficient that the taker
    knows or foresees that his actions would be certain or substantially certain to
    result in the parents (guardians, etc.) being deprived of the ability to
    exercise control over the child.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case law and academics use different phrases, including “morally certain”,
    “virtually certain” and “substantially certain”. Insofar as they are used to
    describe oblique or indirect intent, I take them to have the same meaning. I
    prefer the phrase “virtual certainty”, as to me it best connotes the very high
    degree of certainty required.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mental state predicated on a belief that a result is a virtually certain consequence
    of one’s action must be distinguished from recklessness as to consequences. Recklessness
    refers to a state of mind in which a person decides to do an act, realizing
    that a specific consequence may flow from that act. Indeed, the person may
    realize that the consequence will probably flow from that act. That person is said
    to be reckless as to the consequence. Recklessness will suffice to establish
    criminal culpability for many offences. Recklessness is not, however, to be
    equated with intention based on a belief in the virtual certainty that the
    consequences will flow: <em>Buzzanga</em>, at p.&nbsp;384. The <em>mens rea</em> required for attempted murder is not satisfied by recklessness as to the
    consequence. A person who appreciates that his acts may, or probably will, lead
    to the victim’s death is not guilty of attempted murder unless killing his
    victim was his purpose: <em>Ancio</em>, at pp.&nbsp;248-51.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    argue that oblique intent is a misnomer in that it does not describe a distinct
    culpable state of mind, but rather refers to a state of mind – a belief that a
    specific consequence is certain – which provides powerful evidence of an actual
    or direct intention to bring that consequence about: see Beatrice Krebs,
    “Oblique Intent, Foresight and Authorisation” (2018) 7 U.C.L.J.L.J. 1; Glenys
    Williams &amp; Gavin Dingwall, “Inferring Intention” (2004) 55:1 N. Ir. Leg. Q.
    69. Professor Stuart goes so far as to describe the distinction between direct
    and indirect or oblique intent as “pedantic” and unnecessary in the real world
    of criminal trials and jury instructions: Stuart, at p.&nbsp;250.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that in most attempted murder cases, there will be no need for the trial
    judge to distinguish between an accused’s purpose and an accused’s belief as to
    the certainty of the consequence of his act when explaining to the jury the <em>mens
    rea</em> required for attempted murder. In most cases, it will be enough that
    the jury understand that if they conclude that the accused believed his actions
    would certainly lead to the victim’s death, that belief provided powerful evidence
    of the intention to kill.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, the distinction can be important if the evidence in the case suggests
    that the accused acted with a purpose other than to cause the death of the victim.
    In that kind of case, the jury needs more help with the meaning of “intend to
    kill”. The jury must understand that a purpose other than a purpose to kill,
    even a desire not to kill, does not necessarily exculpate on a charge of
    attempted murder. It is equally important that the jury understand that in the
    absence of proof that the accused’s purpose was to kill, the Crown can succeed
    only by demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused believed that
    the victim’s death was a virtually certain consequence of his actions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no impediment to holding that the intention to kill for the purposes of
    attempted murder encompasses both forms of intention described in <em>Buzzanga</em>. <em>Ancio</em>, which firmly rejects recklessness as a basis for the <em>mens
    rea</em> of murder, does not consider whether a belief in a virtual certainty that
    a consequence will occur can be a form of intent. There is English authority
    that accepts that oblique intent will suffice for attempted murder: see <em>R.
    v. Walker</em> (1989) 90 Cr. App. R. 226.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is there any policy basis for distinguishing between the two forms of intent
    described in <em>Buzzanga</em>. A person who decides to commit an act believing,
    to a virtual certainty, that the act will cause the death of another is surely
    as culpable as a person who acts for the purpose of killing another. Indeed,
    the two states of mind are so clearly compatible that in many cases if one
    exists, so will the other.</p>

    significantly, this court, in an earlier appeal brought by the appellant, has
    held that oblique intent, as described in <em>Buzzanga</em>, can support a
    conviction on the attempted murder charges. The appellant was discharged at his
    preliminary inquiry on the attempted murder charges. The Crown successfully brought
    a motion to quash the discharges: <em>R. v. Boone</em>, 2011 ONSC 5889. On a
    further appeal by the appellant, this court affirmed the decision of the
    Superior Court: <em>R. v. Boone</em>, 2012 ONCA 539. Simmons J.A., speaking for
    the full court on this issue, described the appellant’s potential liability for
    attempted murder in these terms, at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the appellant believed that by infecting his sexual partners
    his conduct would, in the absence of intervening circumstances that might cause
    their death, inevitably kill them, in my view, it would be open to a trier of
    fact to find that he possessed a specific intent to kill.</p>

    I read Crown counsel’s closing argument to the jury, she did not specifically invite
    the jury to find that the appellant set out to infect and kill his sexual
    partners. In other words, she did not argue that the appellant’s purpose in
    infecting his partners was to kill them. She argued for a form of intention
    akin to the oblique intent described in <em>Buzzanga</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, Crown counsel said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Boone’s specific desire is to infect people. His motive is
    the satisfaction of his own perverse sexual desires, and he <span
class=Underline>knows that by infecting these men it is predictable that the
    HIV infection will cause their deaths. Of course he knows this. Everyone knows
    this. He sets about trying and hoping to infect them, doing the very thing that

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I understand it, the Crown’s case rested essentially on this chain of
    reasoning:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant intended to infect his sexual partners with HIV;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>to maximize the chances of achieving that goal, he lied to his
    partners about his HIV status, engaged in unprotected anal intercourse, knowing
    that he had a very high viral load and continued to lie to his partners about
    his status, thereby reducing the likelihood that the partners would seek
    medical assistance;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he believed that HIV could lead to AIDS, a deadly disease; and</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence argued that there was no evidence that the appellant wanted to or meant
    to kill his partners in the sense that their death was his purpose or the desired
    outcome. As counsel put it: “Mr. Boone wanted to date them, not kill them.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span

    counsel also addressed the oblique intention theory of liability:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[U]nlike the scenario where the gun is placed to the head and
    death is almost certain, the same cannot be said for contracting HIV. Is death
    a possibility? Sure it is. Did Mr.&nbsp;Boone know that? He did. But is death
    probable or predictable such that you can infer he had specifically intended to
    kill these men? No.</p>

    specific state of mind. Crown counsel must satisfy you beyond a reasonable
    doubt that when he did the things that amount to an attempt, <span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of their deliberations, the jury asked:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[I]n the case of attempted murder, where state of mind is
    important, does killing the person need to be the primary goal of the act in
    order to find a verdict of guilty?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s answer reinforced the earlier instructions about the nature of
    the intent required for attempted murder:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A person may act with more than one intent. Killing the person
    does not have to be the primary intent. However, Crown counsel must satisfy you
    beyond a reasonable doubt that when he did the things that amount to an
    attempt, Mr. Boone meant to kill [D.S.], [M.C.] and/or [M.B.]. Nothing less
    will do.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge offered no further explanation of the requisite intent beyond
    repeated references to the requirement that the Crown prove that the appellant
    “meant to kill”. She did tell the jury that they could (not must) infer that
    the appellant intended the natural and probable consequences of his act. The
    trial judge also reviewed the evidence pertaining to the appellant’s desire to
    infect others, his knowledge of the effects of HIV, the expert evidence and
    other evidence that might provide insight into the appellant’s intention when
    he had sex with each of the complainants named in the attempted murder charges.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s arguments</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant alleges five specific errors. He submits that the trial judge failed
    to distinguish between an intention to infect a sexual partner with HIV and an
    intention to kill that partner. Only the latter could justify a conviction for
    attempted murder. The appellant further contends that the trial judge failed to
    make it clear to the jury that the Crown had to prove an intention to kill and
    that nothing less than an intention to kill would suffice. The appellant argues
    that the trial judge should have told the jury that an intention to infect with
    HIV and thereby cause harm, even serious harm, was not enough. Nor was it
    enough that the appellant may have foreseen the risk, or even the probability
    of death.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other three arguments put forward by the appellant are directed at the manner
    in which the trial judge related the evidence to the <em>mens rea</em> requirement for attempted murder. The appellant submits that, on the evidence
    adduced in this case, the “common sense” inference instruction that a person
    intends the natural consequences of his act had no place and was misleading.
    The appellant also argues that the trial judge did not adequately relate the
    expert evidence concerning infection rates and the likelihood of death as a
    result of being infected to the <em>mens rea</em> requirement. Finally, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge should have cautioned the jury about
    drawing inferences as to the appellant’s state of mind exclusively from
    circumstantial evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jury
    instructions must equip the jury with the information needed to properly decide
    the case. The trial judge must explain the legal principles and relate those
    principles to the issues and evidence that arise in the case. In most attempted
    murder prosecutions, as counsel for the appellant acknowledges, it will be
    enough for the trial judge, when explaining the intent required for attempted
    murder, to track the language of s. 229(a)(i) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.
    The trial judge will instruct the jury that the Crown must prove that the
    accused “meant” to (or was “trying to”) kill the victim. The trial judge took
    that approach.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with counsel for the appellant that this was a case in which a more
    detailed explanation of the <em>mens rea</em> component of attempted murder was
    necessary. While telling the jury the appellant must have “meant to kill” the
    complainants would clearly include a finding that when the appellant infected
    his partners, he did so with the purpose of killing them, that was not the
    primary basis upon which the Crown advanced its case of attempted murder. The Crown
    repeatedly spoke in terms of the appellant’s belief with respect to the
    consequences of intentionally infecting his sexual partners. The Crown referred
    to the appellant’s belief that death was “at least a predictable consequence”
    of infection. The Crown also put the appellant’s liability for attempted murder
    in these terms:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[H]e deliberately tried to do something he knew would probably
    ultimately kill his victims, and he did it anyway. From this, you can
    absolutely conclude that every time he tried to infect one of his victims, he
    did so with the intent to kill.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Crown’s main theory on the attempted murder was predicated on the
    appellant’s belief as to the consequences of his actions, it was incumbent on
    the trial judge to tell the jury exactly what the Crown had to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt to establish the requisite intent on the theory advanced by
    the Crown. The Crown had to prove that:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant intended to infect each of the complainants with
    HIV; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the appellant believed, absent medical intervention, that death at
    some point in the future was a virtual certainty as a consequence of
    contracting HIV.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was also crucial that the trial judge relate the evidence to both the
    appellant’s intention to infect his partners, and the appellant’s belief that,
    absent medical intervention, his partners’ deaths from AIDS, at some point in
    the future, was a virtual certainty. While the trial judge reviewed the
    relevant evidence in a fair and balanced manner, she did not relate it to the
    appellant’s state of mind as described above. This failure was particularly
    important in respect of the contention that the appellant believed that, absent
    medical intervention, his partners’ deaths from AIDS was a virtual certainty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the phrase “meant to kill”, without more, would not inform the jury
    that they could only find the requisite intent based on the appellant’s belief
    with respect to the consequence of death if they were satisfied that the
    appellant believed that death was a virtual certainty. There was a real risk
    that the jury would proceed on the basis that the phrase “meant to kill”
    included a belief by the appellant that death was a possible, or even a
    probable outcome of his actions. Neither is sufficient to establish the <em>mens
    rea</em> for murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    risk was enhanced by the trial judge’s summary of the Crown’s position:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Boone knew the terrible and fatal consequences of being
    infected with HIV, and by anally penetrating [the complainants] and ejaculating
    inside them, he was doing exactly what he knew would be most likely to bring
    about that very result. To satisfy his own perverse sexual desires, <span
class=Underline>he attempted to infect them with HIV, knowing that if he
    succeeded, he could also succeed in causing their deaths.</span> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the appellant believed that his actions “<em>could</em> also succeed in causing
    their deaths”, but it was not his purpose to cause their deaths, the appellant
    was not guilty of attempted murder. The Crown had to prove either that the
    appellant’s purpose was to kill his partners, or that he believed that eventual
    death from AIDS was a virtual certainty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was evidence that the appellant knew that his partners could be infected with
    HIV. Indeed, there was strong evidence that he wanted to infect his partners
    with HIV. There was also evidence that the appellant knew that HIV could lead
    to AIDS and to death at some point in the future if left untreated. However,
    the evidence capable of supporting the inference that the appellant believed
    that death at some point was a virtual certainty was not strong. There was also
    a body of evidence suggesting that the appellant understood that even if his
    partners were infected with HIV, death from AIDS was far from a certainty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to bear in mind that in the context of the <em>mens rea</em> inquiry, it is the appellant’s purpose or his subjective belief about the
    likelihood of death as a consequence of infection that matters. The expert
    evidence speaks to the state of scientific knowledge and statistical
    possibilities of infection and death. That evidence is not directly relevant to
    the appellant’s belief or his purpose, although it may, if somehow connected to
    the appellant’s state of mind, assist the jury in deciding what the appellant
    believed.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Summary</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was essential that the jury be told that it could convict the appellant on the
    attempted murder charges only if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant acted with the purpose of killing each of the complainants, or that
    he believed their death at some point in the future from AIDS was a virtually
    certain consequence of HIV infection. The trial judge did not give those
    instructions and did not relate the evidence to the issues arising from the
    issue of the appellant’s foreseeability of the certainty of the consequences of
    his acts.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the Crown’s arguments at trial in support of the attempted murder
    charges, there was a real danger that without the specific instruction outlined
    above, that the jury would proceed on the basis that the appellant “meant” any consequence
    that he saw as a possible or probable consequence of HIV infection. The trial
    judge’s instructions with respect to the <em>mens rea</em> for attempted murder
    revealed non-direction, constituting misdirection. I would quash the attempted
    murder convictions.</p>
  <p class=KHeading10>(vii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “common sense inference” instruction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    I would quash the attempted murder convictions for the reasons set out above, I
    will address one other argument advanced by the appellant. I agree with counsel
    for the appellant that the “common sense inference” instruction given by the trial
    judge in respect of the attempted murder charges was inappropriate and potentially
    misleading in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    instructing the jury on the state of mind required to establish the offence of
    attempted murder, the trial judge told the jury:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>You may conclude, as a matter of common sense, that if a person
    does something that has natural and probable consequences, sometimes also
    referred to as predictable consequences, that person usually intends or means
    to cause those consequences. But that is simply one way for you to determine a
    person’s actual state of mind, what he actually meant to do. It is a conclusion
    that you may <em>only</em> reach, however, after considering all the evidence. [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    “common sense inference” instruction is part of most jury instructions. It is
    an example of the more general instruction to juries that they should use their
    common sense in deciding the issues, including the inferences that should or
    should not be drawn about an accused’s state of mind.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    “common sense inference” instruction, however, assumes that the act or acts in
    question have natural and probable consequences. If, as a matter of common
    human experience, an act commonly produces a certain result, it makes sense,
    absent some other explanation, to infer that the person who did the act
    intended the result which commonly flows from doing the act. Thus, if “A” stabs
    “B”, it is usually safe to infer he intended to cause “B” bodily harm. The more
    likely, as a matter of common human experience, the consequence is to flow from
    the action, the stronger will be the inference that the person intended that
    consequence. Properly used, the “common sense inference” is a helpful tool to
    be used in assessing the evidence going to the accused’s state of mind: Baker, at
    p.&nbsp;115.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    “common sense inference” instruction is helpful, however, only if, as a matter
    of common human experience, there is a close causal connection between the act
    and the consequence which is material to the criminal charge. Can it be said
    that a close causal connection exists either between the sexual activity
    engaged in by the appellant and the infection of his partners, or between the
    infection of his partners and their ultimate death from AIDS? The evidence says
    no to both questions. Indeed, the expert evidence indicates that neither
    infection as a result of the sexual activity, nor eventual death from infection
    can be accurately described as “natural and probable consequences”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    could be argued that, as a matter of logic, the “common sense inference”
    instruction would have assisted the appellant in that the death of his partners
    was not, on the evidence, the natural and probable, or predictable consequences
    of his actions. However, my concern is that the “common sense inference”
    instruction, which invites the use of common sense to draw inferences from the
    evidence, could be taken by the jury as an indication that it could conclude,
    using its own common sense, that infection and death were indeed the natural
    and probable consequences of the appellant’s actions. Both inferences went
    beyond what could be inferred as a matter of common sense. Indeed, both
    inferences were contrary to the evidence given by the experts, the only
    evidence which could speak to the necessary causal connection between the
    appellant’s actions and the consequences of those actions.</p>

    appellant submits that, apart from the errors in the jury instruction on
    attempted murder, the appellant could not, as a matter of law, be convicted of
    attempting to murder M.B. This argument rests on the assertion that M.B.’s
    consent to sexual activity knowing the appellant was HIV positive effectively
    precludes the conviction of the appellant on any criminal charge arising out of
    the sexual activity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that M.B. knew the appellant was HIV positive and gave an informed
    consent to the sexual activity with the appellant. Counsel for the appellant
    submits that M.B.’s informed decision to have sex with the appellant, knowing
    he was HIV positive, not only rendered the sexual activity consensual, but also
    meant that there could be “no criminal liability” arising out of the sexual
    activity. The interveners, Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and HIV &amp; AIDS
    Legal Clinic Ontario, support the appellant’s position. The interveners argue
    that the appellant’s criminal convictions in the face of M.B.’s informed
    consent to the sexual activity are “offensive, discriminatory, and violate the
    human dignity and autonomy of people living with HIV.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, counsel for the appellant accepted that M.B.’s consent to unprotected
    sex had no impact on the attempted murder charge. Counsel at trial was correct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As <em>Mabior</em> makes clear, if a person consents to sexual activity knowing
    the partner is HIV positive, that consent is an answer to any criminal charge
    in respect of which the Crown must prove the absence of consent. Those charges
    would include assault, sexual assault, aggravated assault, and aggravated sexual
    assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Mabior</em>,
    however, does not create a general amnesty from criminal liability in respect
    of allegations arising out of consensual sexual activity with a person who is
    HIV positive. <em>Mabior</em> says nothing about liability for offences that do
    not require proof of the absence of consent. There are many such offences, including
    attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the attempted murder charge, the Crown was required to prove that the appellant
    intended to kill M.B., and did something in furtherance of that intention that
    went beyond preparation. The conduct said to constitute the <em>actus reus</em> of the attempt need not be criminal or even unlawful. The culpability arises
    principally from the accused’s mental state. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.B.
    could clearly not have consented to being killed by the appellant: <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, ss. 14, 241.2. I see no basis for holding that M.B.’s consent to sex
    with the appellant somehow negates or vitiates any essential element of the
    offence of attempted murder. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the interveners’ submission that the appellant’s conduct becomes
    “morally blameless” because of M.B.’s consent to sex ignores the fact that to
    prove the attempted murder charge, the Crown had to prove that the appellant
    intended to kill M.B. It is a misnomer, to say the least, to describe someone
    who intends to kill another as “morally blameless”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also do not accept
    that a conviction of the appellant for attempted murder, assuming he intended
    to kill, is somehow discriminatory or offensive to the dignity of persons
    living with HIV. Anyone who intends to kill someone else, and does something
    beyond preparation to bring that result about, is a would-be murderer and
    properly accountable under the criminal law. Holding the appellant accountable,
    assuming he had the intention to kill, in no way imposes a special rule on him
    or limits his ability to engage in consensual sexual activity any more than it
    limits anyone else’s ability to engage in sexual activity. </p>

    instructions on the offence of administering a noxious thing?</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was
    convicted of administering a noxious thing to D.S. (count 2) and administering
    a noxious thing to M.C. (count 5). Both convictions were stayed. The two counts
    were worded identically. For example, count 2 read:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>And further that the said Steven Paul Boone … did, with intent
    to endanger the life of or cause bodily harm to another person, namely [D.S.],
    administer a noxious thing, namely Human Immunodeficiency Virus, contrary to Section
    245, clause (a) of the Criminal Code.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offence of
    administering a noxious thing is created by s. 245(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.
    The relevant portions of the section read:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Every one who administers … to any person … any … noxious thing
    is guilty of an indictable offence and liable</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) to imprisonment for a term not
    exceeding fourteen years, if he intends thereby to endanger the life of or to
    cause bodily harm to that person; or</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) to imprisonment for a term not
    exceeding two years, if he intends thereby to aggrieve or annoy that person.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the
    indictment specifically alleged the intention described in s.&nbsp;245(1)(a).
    The trial judge instructed the jury that it was for them to determine whether
    the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant meant to
    cause the complainants bodily harm and/or to endanger their lives. No one took
    issue with this instruction at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant makes
    two submissions in respect of the findings of guilt on the administration of a noxious
    thing charges. He submits that <em>Mabior</em> dictates that in cases involving
    non-disclosure of one’s HIV status, the “operative crime” is aggravated sexual
    assault and that there can be no liability for any other offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As explained above
    (paras. 95-96), <em>Mabior</em> addresses non-disclosure of HIV status in the
    context of allegations in which the Crown is required to prove the absence of
    consent as an element of the offence. Consent is not an element of the charge
    of administering a noxious thing. <em>Mabior</em> says nothing about the
    appellant’s potential liability on the charges of administering a noxious thing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also
    argues that the trial judge misstated the <em>mens rea</em> of the offence. The
    trial judge repeatedly told the jury that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant “meant to cause them [the complainants] bodily harm
    and/or to endanger their lives.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asserts
    that the trial judge was obliged, in keeping with <em>Buzzanga</em>, to tell
    the jury that the Crown had to prove that the appellant knew, to a virtual
    certainty, that his actions would endanger the lives of the complainants. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see no need for an
    instruction on oblique or indirect intent in respect of these charges. The
    Crown’s case rested on the evidence that the appellant intended to infect his
    partners with HIV. In pursuit of that intention, he administered the noxious thing
    – HIV. In doing so, he immediately exposed the complainants to the risk of
    infection, a risk that could lead to a deadly disease. That risk clearly
    endangered their lives. The complainants’ exposure to a risk of infection as a
    consequence of the appellant’s actions was inevitable and immediate. That
    exposure endangered the complainants’ lives. Unlike the attempted murder
    charges, an instruction that the appellant “meant to” endanger the
    complainants’ lives adequately captured the intent requirement. These charges,
    again unlike the attempted murder charges, also lent themselves to the “common
    sense inference” instruction given by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One additional point
    should be made. The appellant has not appealed his convictions on the charges
    of aggravated sexual assault relating to D.S. and M.C. He accepts that he had
    unprotected anal intercourse with those complainants, and that he lied to them
    about his HIV status. By not appealing the convictions, he also accepts that
    his conduct endangered the lives of D.S. and M.C. In light of those unappealed
    convictions and the findings underlying them, I would give little credence to
    the submission that the trial judge misdirected the jury on the requirement of
    an intent to endanger life as an element of the charges of administering a
    noxious thing to D.S. and M.C.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    adequately instructed the jury on the essential elements of the offence of administering
    a noxious thing. She also properly stayed the convictions pursuant to the
    principle in <em>R. v. Kienapple</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[111]<span

    appellant with attempting to administer a noxious thing to M.B. The jury
    returned a guilty verdict. The trial judge stayed the finding of guilt in light
    of the jury’s guilty verdict on the attempted murder charge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was the Crown’s
    theory on the attempted administration of a noxious thing charge that the
    appellant believed that M.B. was not infected with HIV at the time they had
    unprotected anal sex. In fact, M.B. was HIV positive. Consequently, the Crown
    charged attempt rather than the full offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In setting out the
    elements of the offence, the trial judge told the jury that the Crown had to
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant believed that M.B. was HIV
    negative. If the Crown failed to prove that fact beyond a reasonable doubt, the
    jury was required to acquit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this count, the
    Crown alleged that the appellant was trying to infect M.B. with HIV. He could
    not achieve that goal because, unknown to him, M.B. was already HIV positive. Impossibility
    is not a defence to a charge of attempting to commit a crime: <em>Dynar</em>, at
    para. 67; <em>R. v. Williams</em>, 2003 SCC 41, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 134, at paras.
    62-64. The fact that the appellant could not infect M.B. with HIV was no legal
    impediment to his conviction on the charge of attempting to administer a
    noxious thing. Nor could M.B.’s knowledge that the appellant was HIV positive
    impact on the appellant’s liability for attempting to administer a noxious thing.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was accepted at
    trial that the appellant had anal intercourse with B.C. on one occasion. He
    lied to B.C., telling him that he was HIV negative. B.C., who was HIV negative,
    would not have had sex with the appellant if he knew that the appellant was HIV
    positive. Fortunately, B.C. was not infected by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>B.C. insisted that the
    appellant wear a condom when they had sex. He saw the appellant put the condom
    on before he penetrated B.C. and saw him take it off after. B.C. could not say
    whether the appellant ejaculated before he removed his penis from B.C. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s
    liability on this count turned on whether the Crown had proved beyond a
    reasonable doubt that there was a realistic possibility that HIV would be
    transmitted to B.C. during the sexual activity. If that realistic possibility
    existed, and in light of the appellant’s misrepresentation as to his HIV status,
    B.C.’s apparent consent to sexual activity was vitiated. A realistic
    possibility of transmitting HIV also established the endangerment to life
    element of the offence of aggravated sexual assault: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s.
    273; <em>Mabior</em>, at paras. 91-94, 104.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The experts agreed
    that the receptive partner in anal intercourse faces the highest risk of
    infection from an HIV-positive partner. They also agreed that the higher the
    viral load of the infected person, the higher the risk of infecting the
    partner. The appellant had a high viral load. Were these the only two factors relevant
    to risk, the allegation involving B.C. would be indistinguishable from the
    allegations involving the other three complainants. A realistic possibility of
    infection would clearly exist.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were, however,
    two additional factors that potentially made the assessment of B.C.’s risk
    different than the risk assessment as it applied to the other complainants. There
    was evidence that the appellant used a condom when he had sex with B.C., and
    there was evidence that he did not ejaculate into B.C.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The experts agreed
    that the proper use of condoms, and the absence of ejaculation, significantly
    reduced the risk of transmission. Dr. Remis, the Crown expert, estimated that
    if the appellant properly used a condom and did not ejaculate before he
    withdrew from B.C., the chances of infection were 1 per 1,000 acts. If the
    appellant ejaculated, Dr. Remis put the risk at 1 per 500 acts (0.2 percent).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Tyndall testified
    that without ejaculation, the risk of infection decreased. He did not think
    that the studies permitted an accurate quantification of that reduction. Dr.
    Tyndall agreed with Dr. Remis that condom use reduced the risk of transmission
    overall by about 80 percent. Dr. Tyndall also testified that if the condom was
    properly applied and did not malfunction during use, the risk reduction
    approached very near 100 percent. Of course, no one could know ahead of any particular
    sexual activity whether the condom would malfunction in some way.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits
    that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that, in the absence of
    any evidence of ejaculation or the misuse or sabotaging of the condom by the
    appellant, the Crown could not establish a realistic possibility of
    transmission of HIV, thereby necessitating an acquittal on the charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with counsel
    for the appellant that the evidence did not permit an inference that the
    appellant ejaculated into B.C. I disagree that it was not open to the jury to
    infer that the appellant somehow sabotaged the condom before having sex with
    B.C. The appellant’s text messages are replete with references to how he would deceive
    his partners by pretending to use condoms, or by poking holes into the condoms
    he used. It was open to the jury to infer that the appellant used one of these
    “tricks” in the face of B.C.’s insistence that he wear a condom. The appellant
    clearly preferred unprotected sex. It was also, of course, open to the jury to
    treat the appellant’s texts as untrue and reflective of the roleplaying among
    the individuals who frequented these websites and not actual events.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the jury was
    satisfied that the appellant did something to compromise the effectiveness of
    the condom, Dr. Remis’s evidence indicated that the risk of HIV infection would
    increase and could, in some situations, approach the risk associated with unprotected
    sex. The risk described by Dr. Remis fell well within the level of risk
    required to establish a “realistic risk” under <em>Mabior</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that
    for the purposes of determining the appellant’s liability on the charge of
    aggravated sexual assault in respect of B.C., it did not matter whether the
    appellant ejaculated or somehow compromised the condom. Crown counsel relies on <em>Mabior</em>. Counsel submits that in the interests of providing “greater
    certainty”, <em>Mabior</em> defined realistic risk, both at the level of
    principle and by reference to “concrete situations”. The Crown argues that <em>Mabior</em> declared that a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV existed unless the
    infected person, both wears a condom and has a low viral load. As the appellant
    had a high viral load, there was a realistic risk of infection, regardless of
    whether he wore a condom: see <em>Mabior</em>, at paras. 101, 104.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown counsel acknowledges
    that the court was careful in <em>Mabior</em> to tie the risk assessment to the
    evidence in the case. She submits, however, that <em>Mabior</em> intended to identify
    the existence of a realistic risk as a matter of law in certain fact
    situations, subject to the evidence in a particular case demonstrating the need
    for recalculation of the risk.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is force to the
    Crown’s submission. However, it ignores one factor. In <em>Mabior</em>, the
    accused ejaculated into his partners. There was nothing in the evidence in this
    case which could support the inference that the appellant ejaculated into B.C.
    Does this factor, which on the expert evidence in this case reduces the risk of
    infection, take this case outside of the holding in <em>Mabior</em> to the
    effect that condom use only eliminates realistic risk when combined with a low
    viral load?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing what constitutes
    a reasonable possibility of transmission, one takes into account both the
    likelihood of transmission occurring and the potential harm caused if transmission
    occurs. The greater the potential harm, the lesser the likelihood needed to
    satisfy the realistic possibility of transmission requirement: <em>Mabior</em>,
    at paras. 86, 90-92. Infection with HIV remains a serious, life-changing, and life-endangering
    event. It is also a risk which the infected partner unilaterally imposes on the
    uninfected partner as a consequence of a misrepresentation as to HIV status.
    Even low statistical chances of transmission qualify as a realistic possibility
    of transmission, given that the uninfected partner never accepted any risk and
    the very serious harm that results if infection in fact occurs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The expert evidence in <em>Mabior</em> placed the risk of infection from unprotected vaginal
    intercourse, without a condom, and with a person who did not have a reduced
    viral load, as high as 1 in 384 and as low as 1 in 2,000: <em>Mabior</em>, at
    para. 97. The court held that when the risk was significantly ameliorated by either
    condom use, or antiretroviral therapy, but not both, the resulting risk remained
    a realistic, as opposed to speculative or negligible, risk: <em>Mabior</em>, at
    paras. 98-101. As I read <em>Mabior</em>, risks in the order of 1 in 1,000
    remain realistic risks for the purposes of determining when non-disclosure of
    one’s HIV status vitiates consent to sexual activity.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the expert evidence
    adduced in this case, the risk of infection, even absent ejaculation, remained
    at about 1 in 1,000. That risk is at least as great as the risks recognized in <em>Mabior</em> as sufficient to cross the realistic risk threshold.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Putting the risk
    factors at their best for the appellant, and assuming condom use and an absence
    of ejaculation, B.C.’s risk of infection was in the same order at least as the
    risk of infection faced by the victims in <em>Mabior</em>. The appellant was
    properly convicted on this count.</p>

  <p class=Heading>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    sentenced the appellant on March 9, 2016. She gave extensive and careful
    reasons. On March 30, 2016, the trial judge heard submissions from counsel and
    adjusted the sentences she had imposed to accurately reflect the total sentence
    she had intended to impose. Having regard to the totality principle, the trial
    judge determined that an effective sentence of 14 years (168 months) should be
    imposed. She gave the appellant credit on a 1.5:1 basis for presentence custody,
    resulting in a credit of 1,710 days (57 months). She imposed a total net
    sentence of 9 years, 3 months (111 months).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentences imposed
    on the individual counts were as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Attempted murder of D.S. (count 3) – 9 years;</p>

  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>attempted murder of M.C. (count 6) – 1 month consecutive;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>aggravated sexual assault of M.C. (count 4) – 4 years concurrent;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>attempted murder of M.B. (count 8) – 1 month consecutive; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>aggravated sexual assault of B.C. (count 9) – 1 month
    consecutive.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also
    imposed a long-term supervision order under s. 753.1(3) for a period of five
    years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I would order a new
    trial on the attempted murder charges, I am concerned only with the sentences
    on the aggravated sexual assault convictions for the purposes of the sentence
    appeal. Those three sentences totalled 8 years, 1 month. However, those
    sentences no doubt took into account the sentences imposed on the attempted
    murder charge. More significantly, they also took into account, to some extent,
    the lengthy presentence custody. It is impossible to say what sentence the
    trial judge would have imposed had there not been convictions on the attempted
    murder charges. Given her justified concern with totality, I think it is fair
    to say that the sentences for the aggravated sexual assault convictions may
    well have been somewhat higher absent the sentencing on the attempted murder
    charges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, in
    her careful reasons for sentence, made it clear that she regarded the
    aggravated sexual assault convictions as serious offences, particularly the
    conviction involving D.S. The trial judge described the appellant’s conduct as
    “calculated and ruthless” and “deliberate and malicious”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also
    found as a fact that the appellant had infected D.S. with HIV. In doing so, she
    relied on the opinion of Dr. Remis. As counsel for the appellant points out, Dr.
    Remis did not go quite that far. On his analysis of D.S.’s encounters with
    other sexual partners, Dr. Remis concluded “it’s far more likely that he [D.S.]
    was infected by Boone than by any of these partners”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge
    misapprehended Dr. Remis’s evidence to some extent, the evidence he actually
    gave would, in my view, support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the
    appellant infected D.S. The existence of a scientific possibility that someone
    else infected D.S. does not preclude a finding beyond a reasonable doubt based
    on Dr. Remis’s evidence that it was the appellant who infected D.S. Proof
    beyond a reasonable doubt does not require scientific certainty.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I see no reason
    to interfere with any of the findings made by the trial judge on sentence, or
    with the long-term offender order made by the trial judge, I do think the
    interest of justice would be best served by giving counsel the opportunity to
    make submissions as to the appropriate sentences on the aggravated sexual
    assault charges taking into account that the attempted murder convictions have
    been quashed. The Crown may be in a position to indicate whether it intends to
    proceed with the attempted murder charges. If it does not proceed with the
    attempted murder charges, fixing a fit sentence on the aggravated sexual
    assault charges may become a more straightforward matter. Counsel should make
    arrangements for a conference call with me to determine exactly how the
    sentence appeal should proceed.</p>

  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal
    from the convictions on the three attempted murder charges (counts 3, 6 and 8)
    and direct a new trial. I would set aside the stay on the charge of attempting
    to administer a noxious thing (count 7) and direct a new trial. I would adjourn
    the sentence appeal for further submissions, in light of the disposition of the
    conviction appeal.</p>
