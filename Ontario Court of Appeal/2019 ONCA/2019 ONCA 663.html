  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the acquittals entered by Justice David E.

  <p><strong>Hoy A.C.J.O.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown appeals the respondent’s acquittal of
    human trafficking (s. 279.01(1)), procuring a person to offer or provide sexual
    services for consideration (s. 286.3(1)), and advertising sexual services for
    consideration (s. 286.4). It submits that the trial judge erred in law by
    misinterpreting these provisions, that he consequently misdirected the jury,
    and that the errors might reasonably be thought, in the circumstances of this
    case to have had a material bearing on the respondent’s acquittals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the following reasons, I agree that the trial
    judge misdirected the jury. I would order a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span

    a brief, broad outline of the events giving rise to the charges. I will then
    set out the </span><em>Criminal Code</em> <span lang=EN-US>provisions in
    question, review the charge provided to the jury regarding those provisions,
    and explain how the trial judge erred in his charge.</span></p>
  <h1>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The charges arose out of events that occurred over a two-week period in
    November 2015. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was 22 years of age and had experienced a difficult
    upbringing. She began working at a strip club as a dancer. It was her first
    involvement in the adult entertainment industry. She met the complainant on
    November 5, 2015 – the day that the complainant began working as a dancer at
    the strip club and about a month after the respondent had begun working there.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was 18 years of age and had never worked at an adult
    entertainment establishment before. She had been kicked out of her mother’s home
    and was living in an apartment, receiving welfare. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent and the complainant quickly developed a relationship.
    When the respondent said she needed a place to stay, the complainant let her
    stay at her apartment. The respondent stayed there over the next two weeks. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant and the respondent were the only two witnesses at trial.
    Although they described the same general series of events, their evidence
    diverged about the nature of their relationship and the extent of the
    respondent’s involvement in the sale of the complainant’s sexual services. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The series of events was generally as follows. On November 17,
    advertisements for the complainant’s sexual services, featuring sexualized
    photos, were posted on the website “Backpage”. On the same day, a client showed
    up at the complainant’s apartment, but the complainant refused to engage in
    anal intercourse with him and he left. On November 18, a male acquaintance of
    the respondent and another man picked up the complainant and the respondent and
    drove them first to one condo, and then to another. At each condo, the
    complainant had intercourse with a client. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early in the morning of November 19, the respondent woke the complainant
    and told her that one of the clients wanted to see her again. When the client
    arrived, the complainant went outside, obtained money from the client, returned
    and gave money to the respondent, and then left with the client. The client
    returned the complainant to her apartment about a day and a half later. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the client dropped the complainant off at the apartment, the
    respondent left. In the respondent’s absence, the complainant called her
    mother, who paid for a cab. When the complainant arrived at her mother’s home,
    she broke down and explained the trouble she had been going through. She did
    not explain how she had met the respondent. Her mother took her to the police
    station. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her evidence at trial, the complainant described several occasions
    when she said the respondent became angry with her while they were living
    together. She also testified that it was the respondent who brought up the
    topic of escorting, and it was the respondent who posted the ads on Backpage
    and told her a client would be showing up at the apartment. According to the
    complainant, when she did not get money from that client, the respondent became
    angry with her, and, the next day, the respondent brought up the topic of
    escorting again. The complainant testified that she went along with what the
    respondent suggested because she was scared after the respondent’s previous
    episodes of anger. She also testified that she gave the money she received from
    clients to the respondent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent testified that it was the complainant’s idea to sell her
    sexual services and that they did the Backpage posting “step-by-step” together,
    using the respondent’s phone and photographs that a male friend of the
    complainant had taken. The respondent testified that she contacted her male
    acquaintance when the complainant asked <span lang=EN-US>her if she knew anyone
    who could help the complainant with escorting. The respondent said that the
    complainant gave all of the money she received from the condo clients to one of
    the males who brought them to the condos. The respondent testified that she
    argued with the males about taking money from the complainant. Ultimately, one
    of the males returned half the money. The next day, when the complainant left
    the apartment to go with one of the clients again, the respondent testified
    that the complainant gave her some money to pay her back for the times the
    respondent had been “paying for everything”.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The modern principle of statutory interpretation

    statutory interpretation, the presumption against tautology is relevant. That
    presumption of statutory interpretation instructs “that the legislature avoids
    superfluous or meaningless words, that it does not pointlessly repeat itself or
    speak in vain”: </span><em>Sullivan</em><span lang=EN-US>, at </span><span
lang=EN-US>p. 211, citing </span><em>Attorney General of Quebec v. Carrières

    Thus, “[e]very part of a provision or set of provisions should be given meaning
    if possible”, and courts should avoid, “as much as possible, adopting
    interpretations that would render any portion of a statute meaningless or
    pointless or redundant”: </span><em>Hutchinson</em><span style='color:black'>,

    the word “or” throughout the part of the provision describing the conduct caught
    by it that the <em>actus reus</em> is disjunctive – not, as the trial judge interpreted
    it, conjunctive. Thus, the conduct requirement is made out if the accused engaged
    in any one of the specific types of conduct set out in the first part of the
    provision – <em>i.e.</em><i> </i>recruits, transports, transfers, receives,
    holds, conceals or harbours. It is also made out if the accused’s conduct
    satisfies one of the acts in the second part – <em>i.e.</em><i> </i>exercises
    control, direction or influence over the movements of a person. For example,
    the <em>actus reus</em> would be made out if the accused recruited the complainant.
    It would also be made out if the accused exercised influence over the movements
    of the complainant. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>There is nothing in the offence provision, the other
    provisions concerning human trafficking or the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>as a whole that indicates that the use of the word “or” in
    this provision should be given anything other than its ordinary and grammatical
    meaning – </span><em>i.e.</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>one requiring that the
    various conduct caught by the provision be read disjunctively rather than conjunctively.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, a disjunctive interpretation is consistent

    that has, as its purpose, the exploitation of vulnerable persons”: </span><em>A.A.</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 88 (emphasis added). A disjunctive reading of the various
    conduct caught by s. </span>279.01(1) supports the achievement of this object
    by capturing various and diverse types of offending conduct, including some
    which are “preliminary or preparatory conduct, such as recruitment”: <em>A.A.</em>,
    at para. 88. A conjunctive interpretation, melding the meanings of all of the

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the essence of what the Court of
    Appeal of Quebec adds here is that all these residual terms – “exercises
    control, direction or influence” – evoke a scenario in which a person, by
    virtue of her or his relationship with the complainant, has some power –
    whether physical, psychological, moral or otherwise – over the complainant and his
    or her movements. As stated in </span><em>A Handbook for Criminal Justice
    Practitioners on Trafficking in Persons</em><span lang=EN-US>, (Ottawa:
    Department of Justice, 2015), which was developed by the
    Federal/Provincial/Territorial Working Group on Trafficking in Persons, these
    residual terms characterize “the nature of conduct in terms of the relationship
    between the accused and the victim in relation to the victim’s mobility”: at p.
    20. In other words, by virtue of the relationship between the accused and the complainant,
    the accused was in a position or had the ability to control, direct, or
    influence the movements of the complainant. However, as already stated, the
    terms “control”, “direct” and “influence” involve different degrees of coercion:
    see </span><em>Urizar</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 76 (“[L]’infraction peut
    être commise par des agissements qui, <u>à</u></span><span class=Underline> degré

lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The jury ought to have been instructed on how
    exercising influence was different from exercising direction, and, especially,
    that it involved a lesser degree of coercion with respect to the complainant’s
    movements. The trial judge erred in not doing so, and further erred in
    essentially equating these two modes of committing this offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, each of the two errors discussed above requires a new trial,
    because they “might reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case
    at hand, to have had a material bearing on the acquittal”: <em>R. v. Graveline</em>,
    2006 SCC 16; [2006] 1 S.C.R. 609, at para. 14. In essence, these errors had the
    effect of requiring the Crown to prove more than the offence provision demanded
    for a finding of guilt. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since a retrial is required, guidance is appropriate. Therefore, it is
    prudent to point out an additional error even though it was not raised by the
    Crown and I am not relying upon it to resolve this appeal. That error relates
    to the exploitation issue. Specifically, although the trial judge correctly
    charged the jury that the Crown must prove what the respondent did was “for the
    deliberate purpose of exploiting” the complainant, and that “[t]he focus is on
    the accused’s actions and what effect they might be anticipated to have as
    opposed to what effect they actually had on the alleged victim”, he
    subsequently stated that the Crown was required to prove that the respondent
    actually exploited the complainant. Specifically, he instructed the jury: “In
    short, did [the respondent] <span class=Underline>cause</span><span lang=EN-US> there to be a reasonable expectation of fear for safety </span><span
class=Underline>in [the complainant]</span><span lang=EN-US> if she did not
    provide sexual services? That is the question” (emphasis added). He also
    instructed the jury: “Was there an exercise of control over [the complainant’s]
    movements and </span><span class=Underline>was she exploited</span>?” Those are
    the questions” (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These latter instructions are incorrect, because a finding of actual
    exploitation is not an essential element of the offence. The Crown need only
    prove that the accused intentionally engaged in any of the conduct described in
    s. 279.01(1) with the <span class=Underline>purpose</span> of exploiting the
    complainant or facilitating her or his exploitation: <em>A.A</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em>, at paras. 84-86. No exploitation need
    actually occur or be facilitated by the accused’s conduct. The focus of this
    element is on the accused’s state of mind – <em>i.e.</em><i> </i>his or her
    purpose in engaging in the prohibited conduct – and not on the actual
    consequences of his or her conduct for the complainant: <em>A.A.</em>, at para.
    86. As Watt J.A. observed in <em><span lang=EN-US>A.A.</span></em>, at para.
    87, where exploitation, as defined in s. 279.04, arises from the facts,
    “inferring that the accused’s purpose was to exploit the victim will usually be
    a relatively straightforward task.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Urizar</em>, the Court of Appeal of Quebec came to the same
    conclusion about the purpose element, stating, at para. 69:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Les actes mentionnés au premier alinéa de l’article 279.01

    Code</em> offences addressing prostitution-related conduct unconstitutional. I
    say more about Bill C-36 below, in relation to the offence in s. 286.4 of
    advertising sexual services for consideration. Bill C-36 also modernized and
    reformulated the prior procuring offence in s. 212(1), by enacting s. 286.3(1). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The new procuring offence set out in s. 286.3(1) reads as follows:</p>

    services for consideration or, for the purpose of facilitating an offence under

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As can be seen from the wording of s. 286.3(1), there are two modes of
    committing the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>of the procuring offence :</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accused “procures a person to offer or provide sexual services for

  <p class=AParaNumbering>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accused “recruits, holds, conceals or harbours a person who offers

    or influence over the movements of that person.” </p>

lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <em>actus reus</em> of the offence of
    procuring can be established by proof of conduct satisfying either of these modes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US> Dealing with the first mode, “procure” means “to
    cause, or to induce, or to have a persuasive effect upon the conduct that is
    alleged.” This definition was adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>R. v. Deutsch</em>,
    [1986] 2 S.C.R. 2, at pp. 26-27, in considering the procuring offence then in
    effect. This court subsequently applied this definition to the former procuring
    offence in s. 212(1)(d): <em>R</em></span><em>.</em><em><span lang=EN-US> v.
    Barrow</span></em><em><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'> (2001)</span></em><span

    S.C.C.A. No. 431; <em>R. v. Bennett </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(2004)</span></em>,
    184 C.C.C. (3d) 290 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 53. </span>And lower courts have
    applied this definition from <em>Deutsch</em> to the new procuring offence: <em>Alexander</em>,
    at para. 51; <em>R. v. Evans</em>, 2017 ONSC 4028, at para. 137. I agree that
    this is the correct definition to use for the term “procure” in s. 286.3(1). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The second mode of committing the <em>actus reus</em> of procuring shares language with the human trafficking offence in s. 279.01(1). </span>With the exception of the words “transports”, “transfers” and “receives”,
    which are included in the human trafficking offence but not the procurement
    offence, Parliament used the same words and phrasing. As I will explain below,
    like the human trafficking offence, the second mode of the <em>actus reus</em> for the procuring offence is satisfied by proof that the accused committed any
    one of the specified types of conduct – <em>i.e.</em><i> </i>recruits, holds,
    conceals, harbours, or exercises control, direction or influence over movement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To prove <em>mens rea</em> for the first mode of the procuring offence,
    the Crown must prove that the accused intended to procure a person to offer or
    provide sexual services for consideration. To prove <em>mens rea</em><i> </i>for
    the second mode, the Crown must prove that the accused intended to do anything
    that satisfies the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>for this mode in relation to a
    person who offers or provides sexual services for consideration, and that the
    accused acted with the purpose of facilitating an offence under s. 286.1(1)
    (the purchasing sexual services offence). More will be said about these
    elements below in the course of my analysis of the trial judge’s charge
    regarding this offence. </p>
  <h3>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s charge on procuring</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The procuring charge was described on the indictment as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Alicia GALLONE further stands charged:      </p>
  <p class=CQuote>2.       That she … did for the purpose of facilitating an
    offence under subsection 286.1(1) procure, recruits, holds, conceals or
    harbours [the complainant] a person who offers or provides sexual services for
    consideration, or exercises control, direction or influence over the movements
    of [the complainant], contrary to section 286.3(1) of the Criminal Code of
    Canada[.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge charged the jury as follows with respect to this
    offence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The procuring first part of this definition, “procures,
    recruits, conceals or harbours,” means to cause, induce or have persuasive
    effect. This requires the accused’s active encouragement and involvement in the
    prostitution of another.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The second way the offence can be proved is found in the second
    clause I referred to which is, “exercise control, direction or influence over
    the movements of a person,” for the purpose of facilitating prostitution. You
    will recognize this language from the human trafficking charge, count number
    one. The same definition applies here. Here it is again. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>These words express slightly different concepts, but again,
    they must be read together as one. Recruit, means to enlist someone, to
    persuade them to get involved, like an army recruitment campaign. Conceal,
    means to hide or secret away. Exercise control over movements of a person;
    control refers to invasive behaviour, domination which leaves little choice to
    the person controlled. Exercise direction over the movement of a person, when
    rules or behaviours are imposed. The exercise of influence over the movements
    of a person is similar. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>If you were going to look for a governing concept I would have
    thought it would be the requirement of “exercise of control over movement”.
    This sits at the centre of the provision. So that definition again is; control
    refers to invasive behaviour, domination which leaves little choice to the
    person controlled. And remember, it must be control over movement. That is the
    trafficking nature of the offence. The word “trafficking” used to be associated
    mainly with drugs. Trafficking in that context refers to movement. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>So in summary, there are two modes of committing the offence in
    this count: one is the procuring mode which requires causing or inducing the
    prostitution; the other is the requirement of an element of control over the
    prostitute. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Lastly, you must find in order for the Crown to have proved its
    case that [the complainant] was a person “who offers or provides sexual
    services for consideration.” </p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>So summing up on this count, the key issue here is whether [the
    complainant] chose prostitution on her own or whether she was pushed into it by
    [the respondent]. By which I mean, putting it in the legal language, whether
    there was procurement or control.</p>
  <h3>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made the same two errors in his charge on procuring as
    he did in his charge on human trafficking. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, he instructed the jury to treat all of the different and distinct
    types of conduct captured by the second mode of the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>for
    the procuring offence (<span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>recruiting,
    holding, concealing, or harbouring a person, or exercising control, direction
    or influence over the movements</span></span> of a person) “as one” – namely,
    that the accused must have had an element of control over the movements of the
    complainant. He defined control restrictively as “invasive behaviour,
    domination which leaves little choice to the person controlled.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, with the exception of the words “transports”,
    “transfers” and “receives”, Parliament used the same words and phrasing to
    describe the second mode of the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>for procuring under
    s. 286.3(1) as it did to describe the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>for the
    offence of trafficking in persons under s. 279.01(1). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As with the human trafficking offence, a disjunctive interpretation of
    the words used to describe the second mode of the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>for
    procuring accords with the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words used in
    the provision, particularly with the use of the word “or”, and with the
    presumption against tautology. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It also accords with legislative intent. The preamble to Bill C-36
    indicates that one of Parliament’s objectives in enacting these new offences
    was “to continue to denounce and prohibit the procurement of persons for the
    purpose of prostitution”. While in the circumstances little weight needs to be
    placed on other indicators of legislative intent, the extrinsic evidence of
    Parliamentary intent that is available is persuasive, offering more
    particularity. Specifically, the Technical Paper produced by the Department of
    Justice on the new prostitution-related offences, which was tabled before the
    parliamentary committees tasked with reviewing the proposed new offence
    provisions, notes that “[c]onsistent with [this objective], Bill C-36 prohibits <span class=Underline>comprehensively all conduct related to procuring others
    for the purpose of prostitution</span>”: <em>Technical</em><i> Paper – Bill
    C-36</i>, at p. 8 (emphasis added). A broad interpretation that reads the
    prohibited conduct disjunctively rather than conjunctively supports this
    legislative intent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I conclude that the different types of prohibited <span
lang=EN-US>conduct</span> set out in the second mode of s. 286.3(1) should be
    read disjunctively, and the trial judge erred in instructing the jury
    otherwise. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, as he did in relation to the offence of human trafficking, the
    trial judge erred by failing to provide the jury with any instruction regarding
    the meaning of exercising influence except to say that “[t]he exercise of
    influence over the movements of a person is similar” to “[e]xercise direction
    over the movements of a person”, which he had defined as “when rules or
    behaviors are imposed.” As explained above, conflating “influence” with
    “direction” runs counter to the ordinary meaning of these words and the
    presumption against tautology. It also fails to accord with legislative intent,
    because it narrows the reach of the offence provision and renders it less comprehensive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As they did in relation to the offence of human trafficking, each of these
    two errors in the trial judge’s instruction on procuring require a new trial,
    because they “might reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case
    at hand, to have had a material bearing on the acquittal”: <em>Graveline</em>,
    at para. 14. In essence, these errors had the effect of requiring the Crown to
    prove more than the offence provision demanded for a finding of guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before leaving this section of my analysis, I wish to briefly address one
    other issue with the charge on procuring identified by the Crown. I will also
    address an issue with respect to the wording of the indictment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the Crown argues that, although the trial judge correctly defined
    “procure” as “cause, induce or have persuasive effect”, in summing up on this
    count, he erred by essentially equating “procure” with being “pushed” into
    prostitution. In the context of the charge as a whole, I am not persuaded that
    this attempt to summarize the concept of procure in simpler language was an
    error that might reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at
    hand, to have had a material bearing on the acquittal, particularly when the
    trial judge provided the jury with the correct definition earlier in his
    charge. However, it is preferable to use the explanation of “procure” from <em>Deutsch</em><i> </i>rather than search for other ways of explaining this concept. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next, I note that the wording of this count in the indictment
    essentially merged the first mode of committing the <em>actus reus</em> of the
    offence into the second by putting the term “procure” next to “recruits, holds,
    conceals or harbours”, and the trial judge repeated this wording in his charge.
    In future, it would be preferable if the first mode were kept distinct from the
    second, particularly because, as set out above, they contain different
    elements. For example, the first mode does not require that the procured person
    be a person who offers or provides sexual services for consideration. However, as
    the trial judge commented, in this case, this particular element was not really
    in dispute.</p>
  <h1>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ADVERTISING SEXUAL SERVICES</h1>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Parliament enacted s. 286.4 in 2014, pursuant to Bill C-36, it
    created an entirely new offence prohibiting the advertising of an offer to
    provide sexual services for consideration. Section 286.4 provides:</p>

    services for consideration is guilty of [a hybrid offence].<a href="#_ftn10"

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>of this offence is made out if the
    accused advertised an offer to provide sexual services for consideration. The <em>mens
    rea</em> is made out if: (i) the accused intended to advertise the offer; and
    (ii) the accused knew that the offer was one to provide sexual services for
    consideration.</p>

  <h3>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s charge on advertising sexual services</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the advertising offence, the respondent was charged as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Alicia GALLONE further stands charged:      </p>
  <p class=CQuote>3.       That she … did for the purpose of facilitating an
    offence under subsection 286.1(1) knowingly advertise an offer to provide
    sexual services for consideration, contrary to section 286.4 of the Criminal
    Code of Canada.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge directed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>It is vital to recognize under this count that Section 286.5 of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which you do not have, declares that no person can
    be prosecuted for this offence if they are advertising their own sexual
    services.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>So this count deals with the two Backpage ads, obviously. Were
    those, to a significant extent, put together and posted by [the complainant] or
    was [the respondent] the prime mover? [The complainant] said she was forced
    essentially to produce these. [The respondent] testified to the contrary, that
    she helped by lending her phone camera to the photographer and helped [the complainant]
    pick what she wore in the pictures, but this was all at the request of [the
    complainant].</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The key question here for you again will be who was the prime
    mover in deciding to produce and then publish the ad? Advertising sexual
    service is a crime unless you are advertising your own sexual services. The <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, like in the procuring section, makes the seller exempt from
    prosecution.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>So if [the complainant] wanted to advertise her own sexual
    services and [the respondent] merely helped in the way she testified in her
    evidence, there is no crime. That goes for anyone who helped realize [the
    complainant’s] intention. Those advertising their services are entitled to have
    people to help them do that without the helpers becoming criminal accomplices.
    Otherwise, the photographer, the typesetter, the person supplying the clothing,
    anyone advising on any technical aspect and the Backpage company itself would
    all be criminalized.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If on the other hand you are convinced beyond a reasonable
    doubt that it was [the respondent] who was behind the posting of the ad and it
    was her doing more or less, unilaterally, and it was not [the complainant’s]
    choice, then [the respondent] is guilty of this offence.</p>
  <h3>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties’ positions</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues that that the trial judge erred in law by directing the
    jury that the immunity provision in s. 286.5 extends to anyone who knowingly
    assists a seller in advertising his or her own sexual services. The Crown
    submits that the immunity provision only applies to sellers of their own sexual
    services. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response, the respondent argues that the trial judge correctly
    directed the jury that the immunity provision in s. 286.5 extends to anyone who
    knowingly assists a seller in advertising his or her own sexual services. She
    submits that if the seller can lawfully advertise his or her own sexual
    services, then assisting the seller to do something lawful cannot amount to an
    offence. Moreover, she argues, as the trial judge recognized in his charge, the
    Crown’s interpretation would criminalize a very broad range of conduct in
    circumstances where there may be no exploitation whatsoever of the seller by
    the person assisting with advertising the seller’s sexual services. </p>
  <h3>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Analysis </span></em></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the respondent that the Crown’s interpretation of ss. 286.4
    and 286.5 criminalizes a very broad range of conduct in circumstances where
    there may be no exploitative relationship between the seller and the person
    assisting him or her with advertising. However, the respondent did not
    challenge the constitutionality of the prohibition on advertising. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Crown’s
    interpretation of the reach of the immunity provision in s. 286.5 vis-à-vis the
    offence of advertising in s. 286.4, as currently drafted, is correct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, considering the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words used
    in s. 286.5 to describe the reach of the immunity provision in relation to the
    offence set out in s. 286.4, it is clear that immunity only extends to those
    persons who are involved in advertising their own sexual services. In relevant part,
    s. 286.5(1) provides: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>No person shall be prosecuted for … (b) an offence under
    section 286.4 in relation to the advertisement of <span class=Underline>their
    own sexual services</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 286.5(2) provides:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>No person shall be prosecuted for aiding, abetting, conspiring
    or attempting to commit an offence under any of sections 286.1 to 286.4 or
    being an accessory after the fact or counselling a person to be a party to such
    an offence, if the offence relates to the offering or provision of <span
class=Underline>their own sexual services</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no ambiguity in the wording employed here. Immunity applies to:
    (i) those who knowingly advertise <span class=Underline>their own sexual
    services</span>; and (ii) those who aid or abet the advertising of <span
class=Underline>their own sexual services</span>, conspire or attempt to
    conspire to advertise <span class=Underline>their own sexual services</span>,
    act as an accessory after the fact to the advertisement of <span
class=Underline>their own sexual services</span>, and counsel a person to be a
    party to the advertisement of <span class=Underline>their own sexual services</span>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no suggestion in the wording that immunity also extends to
    those who are involved in advertising <span class=Underline>the sexual services
    of others</span>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The restriction of immunity from prosecution for advertising sexual
    services only to those involved in advertising their own sexual services also
    accords with legislative intent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the clarity of s. 286.5, little weight needs to be placed on other
    indicators of legislative intent. Nevertheless, the available extrinsic evidence
    of Parliamentary intent is both clear and reliable. This evidence confirms what
    is evident from the content of the legislation, namely, that, as stated in <em>Technical
    Paper</em>, at p. 3, the new prostitution offences enacted by Parliament
    represent a fundamental shift from the previous view of prostitution as a
    nuisance toward the conceptualization of prostitution as a form of sexual
    exploitation. This shift is reflected in the language used in the preamble to
    Bill C-36, which refers to “the exploitation that is inherent in prostitution”.
    It is also reflected in Parliament’s choice to place the new prostitution
    offences in Part VIII of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, “Offences against the
    Person”. Previously, the prostitution-related offences were in Part VII,
    “Disorderly Houses, Gaming and Betting”: <em>Technical Paper</em>, at p. 3. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As stated in the aforementioned Department of Justice Technical
    Paper that was tabled before the parliamentary committees that reviewed the new
    offence provisions, the overall objective of the new offences “is to reduce the
    demand for prostitution with a view to discouraging entry into it, deterring
    participation in it and ultimately abolishing it to the greatest extent
    possible”: <em>Technical Paper</em>, at p. 3. <span lang=EN-US>The prohibition
    on advertising in s. 286.4 is central to Bill C-36’s objective of reducing the
    demand for sexual services. At the second reading debate on Bill C-36, </span>then
    Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, the Honourable Peter
    MacKay, <span lang=EN-US>stated that Bill C-36 proposes two entirely new offences:
    purchasing sexual services and advertising the sale of sexual services. He
    explained that both are aimed at the goal of reducing the demand for
    prostitution: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The purchasing offence targets the demand for
    prostitution, thereby making prostitution an illegal activity, and to
    complement this offence, the advertising offence targets the promotion of this
    exploitative activity, </span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-US>thereby
    furthering the legislation’s overall objective of reducing the demand for
    sexual services</span></span><span lang=EN-US>: </span><em>House of Commons
    Debates</em><i><span lang=EN-US>, </span></i><span lang=EN-US>41st Parl., 2nd
    Sess., No. 101 (11 June 2014), at p. 6653 (Hon. Peter MacKay).  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in line with this conceptualization of prostitution as exploitation
    rather than nuisance, the new legislative scheme “treats those who sell their
    own sexual services as victims who need support and assistance, rather than
    blame and punishment”: <em>Technical Paper</em>, at p. 9. The immunity
    provision in s. 286.5, as it applies to the prohibition on advertising in s.
    286.4, supports this objective by shielding those who sell their own sexual
    services from prosecution should they advertise their own services (whether as
    a principal, party, conspirator, etc.). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As its language makes clear, the immunity provision does not “legalize”
    the advertising of one’s own sexual services. It simply exempts those who do
    advertise their own sexual services from prosecution. The advertising is still
    unlawful. <span lang=EN-US>As Donald Piragoff, Senior Assistant Deputy
    Minister, Policy Sector, Department of Justice, stated during questioning
    before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on
    September 11, 2014 regarding the meaning of the immunity provision generally:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>If you look at the language used in the
    section [<i>i.e.</i> s. 286.5]… it says no person shall be prosecuted. It
    doesn’t say no person commits an offence or no person is criminally liable. It
    says no person shall be prosecuted in the following circumstances. It’s an
    immunity from prosecution. That doesn’t mean that the person is not involved in
    illegal activity. </span><em>Proceedings of the Standing Senate Committee on
    Legal and Constitutional Affairs</em><span lang=EN-US>, 41-2, No. 15 (11
    September 2014) at p. 15:36 (Hon. Donald Piragoff).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the liability of persons who assist sellers with
    advertising their own sexual services was the subject of specific comment in
    the parliamentary debates. For instance, Ms. Emily Symons (Chair, Prostitutes
    of Ottawa-Gatineau Work Educate &amp; Resist) noted on July 8, 2014 that the
    law would “criminalize sex workers advertising their friends”: <em>House of
    Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights</em>, 41st Parl., 2nd
    Sess., No. 35 (8 July 2014), at p. 4. Mr. Josh Paterson (Executive Director,
    British Columbia Civil Liberties Association) raised the same issue on July 9,
    2014, stating that “it could make criminals out of any sex workers who work
    collectively and advertise collectively, because they would then be
    participating in advertising someone else’s services, not just their own”: <em>House
    of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights</em>, 41st Parl., 2nd
    Sess., No. 40 (9 July 2014), at p. 8. And, on November 4, 2014, in the debates
    before the Senate, the Hon. George Baker noted that in addition to the person
    who advertises the sexual services, “[t]he person who promotes or assists in
    providing those services will be prosecuted”: <em>Senate Debates</em><i>, </i>41st
    Parl., 2nd Sess., No. 92 (4 November 2014), at p. 2379. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, Bill C-36 also enacted ss. 286.2(1) and (2), which criminalize
    receiving a financial or other material benefit, knowing that it was obtained
    by or derived from prostitution. In enacting Bill C-36, Parliament carefully
    crafted exceptions to the offences in ss. 286.2(1) and (2) to ensure that criminal
    liability would not result where there was not an exploitative relationship.
    For example, s. 286.2(4) provides that ss. 286.2(1) and (2) do not apply to a
    person who receives a benefit in certain circumstances, including: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) in consideration for a service or good that they offer, on
    the same terms and conditions, to the general public; or</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(d) in consideration for a service or good that they do not
    offer to the general public but that they offered or provided to the person
    from whose sexual services the benefit is derived, if they did not counsel or
    encourage that person to provide sexual services and the benefit is
    proportionate to the value of the service or good.<a href="#_ftn11"
name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[11]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>These exceptions have not been extended to the
    advertising offences. During the House Committee hearings, there was some
    suggestion that these exceptions might also apply to the advertising offence:
    see <i>e.g. <em>House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights</em></i>,
    41st Parl., 2nd Sess., No. 33 (7 July 2014), at p. 18 (Hon. Bob Dechert); No.
    37 (8 July 2014), at p. 12 (Hon. Robert Goguen) and p. 16 (Hon. Bob Dechert). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To clarify any confusion, the Minister of Justice testified before the
    Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on September 11,
    2014 as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To clarify the scope of this offence, because there has been
    some confusion in this regard, a person who advertises the sexual services of
    other persons would commit the offence and the person who knowingly assists
    other persons in advertising sexual services for sale would be a party to the
    offence. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>However, the person who advertises their own sexual services
    could not be prosecuted for this offence because Bill C-36 treats the person as
    a victim of sexual exploitation. So the new law will target those who purchase
    the bodies and the lives of other human beings. This approach is consistent
    with the bill’s objective of reducing the demand for prostitution while
    treating those subjected to it as victims who need assistance, not punishment: <em>Standing
    Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs</em>, 41st Parl., 2nd
    Sess., No. 15 (11 September 2014), at p. 15:14 <span lang=EN-US>(Hon. Peter
    MacKay)</span>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that Parliament could have, but did not, craft any internal
    exceptions to the advertising offence like those it inserted into the material
    benefit offences supports the view that Parliament intended to treat the
    prohibition on advertising, which furthers the bill’s objective of reducing the
    demand for sexual services, differently from the provision of other goods and
    services, such that it would capture those who assist sellers in advertising
    their sexual services even if there were no exploitative relationship between
    them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, as a matter of statutory interpretation, I am of the view that
    the immunity provision applies only to those who advertise their own sexual
    services and not to those who assist them. This interpretation accords with the
    grammatical and ordinary sense of the wording used in the immunity provision as
    well as legislative intent. The trial judge erred in instructing the jury
    otherwise on this point. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This error <span
lang=EN-US>might reasonably be thought, in the concrete reality of the case at
