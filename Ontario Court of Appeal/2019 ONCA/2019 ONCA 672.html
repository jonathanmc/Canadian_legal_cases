  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants Raed Jaser (“Jaser”) and Chiheb
    Esseghaier (“Esseghaier”) were jointly tried by a court composed of a judge and
    jury. They were convicted of conspiracy to commit murder for the benefit of a
    terrorist group and of two counts of participating in terrorist activity. Esseghaier
    was also convicted of conspiracy to damage transportation infrastructure with
    intent to endanger safety for the benefit of a terrorist group. The trial judge
    sentenced them to life in prison.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants have appealed their convictions and
    sentences raising a number of grounds. Watt J.A. directed that one ground of
    appeal, concerning the selection of the jury at trial, be argued first. These
    reasons address that ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The offences with which the appellants were
    charged included a plan to de-rail a passenger train. The prosecution alleged
    the appellants had been motivated by Islamic extremism and had planned
    terrorist attacks on non-Muslim targets or victims. There had been significant
    pre-trial media coverage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, Jaser’s counsel and the Crown
    agreed, and the trial judge accepted, that challenges for cause of prospective
    jurors were necessary. Questions were developed to be put to each prospective
    juror inquiring whether pre-trial publicity and the fact that each appellant
    was a member of a visible minority and a Muslim would, given the nature of the
    charges, affect the prospective juror’s ability to decide the case against each
    appellant on the evidence at trial without partiality.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When a potential juror is challenged for cause,
    the challenge must be tried and a determination must be made as to whether the
    challenge is true before the potential juror may be sworn and become a member
    of the jury. The </span><em>Criminal Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46,</span></em><span lang=EN-US> contemplates two different
    categories of triers of challenges: rotating triers and static triers.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Rotating triers are two
    persons who will serve on the jury, and they change (rotate) as each additional
    jury member is sworn: s. 640(2). Static triers are two persons who hear and
    determine all challenges until the entire jury has been selected and sworn, but
    who do not themselves become members of the jury: ss. 640(2.1) and (2.2).<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On an application to resolve jury selection
    issues, Jaser sought rotating triers to determine challenges for cause as
    mandated by s. 640(2) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>. He
    asked the court to exercise its inherent jurisdiction to exclude unsworn jurors
    from the courtroom while challenges were heard in order to protect jury
    impartiality by avoiding exposing unsworn jurors to other jurors’ answers. Jaser’s
    counsel indicated that if and only if the court ruled it lacked the inherent
    jurisdiction to order the exclusion of unsworn jurors while using rotating
    triers, then Jaser would apply under s. 640(2.1) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-US> for the exclusion from the courtroom of sworn and unsworn jurors,
    with the result that challenges for cause would be determined by static triers
    under s. 640(2.2). Counsel described this scenario in oral argument as “very
    much our alternate position”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Esseghaier was not represented by counsel at
    trial. He refused the assistance of any counsel who would conduct a defence based
    on the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US> rather than the Holy
    Qur’an. </span><em>Amicus curiae</em> <span lang=EN-US>had been appointed for
    him by the trial judge with a limited role. Although Esseghaier did not make
    submissions about whether jurors should be challenged for cause or about the
    questions they should be asked, the questions the trial judge ruled would be
    asked were as much about him as Jaser. Esseghaier made no application in
    respect of the process for trying such challenges, whether the triers should be
    rotating or static, or about what jurors should be excluded during the process.
    He did not make specific submissions about how Jaser’s application should be
    determined.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge ruled that he had no common law discretion
    or inherent jurisdiction<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> to exclude unsworn jurors during a challenge for cause tried by rotating
    triers. He held the discretion to do so had been removed when ss. 640(2.1) and
    (2.2) of the </span><em>Criminal Code </em><span lang=EN-US>were enacted, which
    provided that all unsworn and sworn jurors could be excluded, but only where static
    triers were used. He also held that if he had such a discretion he would not
    exercise it because it would be wrong to make an order limited to the exclusion
    of only unsworn jurors when the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    in s. 640(2.1), provided a “full and effective statutory remedy” of excluding
    sworn and unsworn jurors. He instead ordered that all jurors, unsworn and sworn,
    be excluded under s. 640(2.1) and that challenges for cause be heard and determined
    by static triers. The jury selected by this process then tried the charges against
    both appellants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Decisions of this court rendered subsequent to
    the trial judge’s ruling on the jury selection process make it clear that he
    erred when he held he had no common law discretion to exclude unsworn jurors while
    rotating jurors tried the challenges for cause. Although at the time of his
    ruling there was a split in trial level case law about the existence of that
    discretion, this court’s jurisprudence subsequently settled that issue in the
    opposite manner to the way the trial judge did. No party challenges that conclusion.
    The issue on this appeal is the extent and effect of the error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants argue that they are entitled to a
    new trial as the error involved a fundamental right of the appellants about the
    process by which the jury was selected and therefore its proper constitution. They
    argue that this type of error cannot be cured by the curative proviso in s.
    686(1)(b)(iv) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown argues that the error did not deprive
    Jaser of an option for jury selection to which he was entitled because the
    trial judge said that even if he had the discretion to order what Jaser sought
    he would not have done so. Moreover, Jaser asked, in the alternative, for the static
    trier procedure that was implemented. Esseghaier is similarly disentitled to
    relief as he did not participate in the jury selection process by his own
    choice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons which follow, I would allow the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Contrary to the Crown’s submissions, the trial
    judge’s alternative holding, that if he had a discretion to exclude unsworn
    jurors while using rotating triers he would not have exercised it, was the
    product of a legally erroneous view of the nature and scope of the discretion.
    The circumstances for the exercise of the discretion were present.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor would I give effect to the Crown’s arguments
    that Jaser cannot complain because he indicated he would make a s. 640(2.1)
    application if the court ruled it did not have the discretion he was seeking to
    have exercised, or that Esseghaier’s non-participation disentitles him to
    relief.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are three procedural options for a
    challenge for cause: (1) rotating triers with no one excluded from the
    courtroom while challenges are heard and determined; (2) rotating triers with
    unsworn jurors excluded from the courtroom;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a> and (3) static triers with sworn and unsworn jurors excluded. While the court
    has a discretion whether to order exclusion when the accused seeks to invoke an
    option that involves it, pursuant to the </span><em>Criminal Code </em><span
lang=EN-US>the accused has the right to choose which option to invoke. A
    wrongful deprivation of an option the accused properly seeks to invoke results
    in an improperly constituted jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s errors deprived Jaser of the option
    which he had properly sought to invoke, rotating triers with unsworn jurors
    excluded from the courtroom. Jaser’s alternate position did not reflect a
    change of mind or a withdrawal of what he had originally sought; it was simply
    a choice between the remaining two options when the one he had sought was
    improperly denied. In these circumstances the procedure implemented, static
    triers, flowed directly from those errors. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Esseghaier refused to meaningfully participate
    in the challenges for cause (and all other aspects of the trial), but that does
    not mean it does not matter what method was used to determine those challenges.
    He never gave up his right to rotating triers as he never invoked the
    alternative of static triers. One jury was selected for both appellants, the
    challenge for cause questions pertained to both, and the trial judge properly
    recognized that Esseghaier would have the benefit of any successful challenges
    for cause by Jaser’s counsel. In the circumstances of this case it cannot be
    said that a jury improperly constituted for one accused was properly constituted
    for the other.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor is this a case in which the curative proviso
    in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US> is
    applicable.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 640 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> deals with the procedure for
    hearing and determining challenges for cause. In 2008, the <em>Criminal Code</em> was amended to add ss. 640(2.1) and (2.2). At the time of trial, in relevant
    part, s. 640 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> provided as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>(2)</strong> If the ground of a challenge is one that
    is not mentioned in subsection (1) and no order has been made under subsection
    (2.1), the two jurors who were last sworn — or, if no jurors have been sworn,
    two persons present who are appointed by the court for the purpose — shall be
    sworn to determine whether the ground of challenge is true.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>(2.1)</strong> If the challenge is for cause and if the
    ground of the challenge is one that is not mentioned in subsection (1), on the
    application of the accused, the court may order the exclusion of all jurors —
    sworn and unsworn — from the court room until it is determined whether the
    ground of challenge is true, if the court is of the opinion that such an order
    is necessary to preserve the impartiality of the jurors.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>(2.2)</strong> If an order is made under subsection
    (2.1), two unsworn jurors, who are then exempt from the order, or two persons
    present who are appointed by the court for that purpose, shall be sworn to
    determine whether the ground of challenge is true. Those persons so appointed
    shall exercise their duties until 12 jurors — or 13 or 14 jurors, as the case
    may be, if the judge makes an order under subsection 631(2.2) — and any
    alternate jurors are sworn.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Section 640(2) is the default rule. The accused need do
    nothing to be entitled to rotating triers. Unless an application is brought,
    and an order is made under s. 640(2.1), challenges for cause are determined by
    rotating triers, that is, the two jurors who were last sworn or if none have
    been sworn, two persons present who are appointed by the court for that
    purpose: </span><em>R. v. Husbands</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2017 ONCA 607, 353

lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, static triers will be used
    only if the accused seeks a specific order. Only if an application is made by
    the accused resulting in an order under s. 640(2.1) for the exclusion of all
    sworn and unsworn jurors, is s. 640(2.2) triggered. This provision requires the
    appointment of two static triers, that is, two fixed persons who determine
    whether challenges are true until the entire jury is empaneled, but who do not
    themselves become jury members.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Thus, unlike rotating triers which are the
    accused’s right without the need to take any action, for static triers to be
    used, there are preconditions. First, there must be an application under s. 640(2.1)
    by the accused for the exclusion of all sworn and unsworn jurors during the
    hearing and determination of challenges for cause. Second, the application must
    succeed and an order under s. 640(2.1) must be made. As this court stated in </span><em>Husbands</em><span
lang=EN-US>: “No application. No static triers. An unsuccessful application. No
    static triers.”: at para. 37.</span></p>

    be initiated by the accused, the result is that the method of trying challenges
    for cause – rotating triers or static triers – is a function of the accused’s
    choice. If the accused does not invoke the procedure for static triers, the
    result will be rotating triers. And only the accused may make a s. 640(2.1) application
    which can lead to the appointment of static triers. The Crown may not. Nor can
    the Court make orders under ss. 640(2.1) and (2.2) in the absence of an
    application by the accused or its “functional equivalent”. Whether there has
    been an application by the accused invoking the option that will involve static
    triers is determined not only by whether a formal application has been made,
    but by looking at what the accused in substance has asked for; in other words,
    it is assessed on a substance over form basis: </span><em>Husbands</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 34, 38-39, 41 and 44-49. If the accused does not, on a
    substance over form basis, invoke the option of static triers, the result will
    be rotating triers.</span></p>

    about exclusion of any jurors from the courtroom when rotating triers were

    to order the exclusion of unsworn jurors. This discretion was exercised when it
    was necessary to preserve the impartiality of the unsworn jurors, which may
    have otherwise been compromised if they were present to hear questions put to
    and answers given by other jurors before they themselves were questioned: </span><em>R.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There can be good reasons for preferring
    rotating triers to static triers that could inform an accused’s decision as to
    which option to invoke. In </span><em>Grant</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>,</span></em><em> </em><span lang=EN-US>this court noted, at para. 21:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Using rotating triers benefits the process of selecting the
    jury in two ways: by avoiding the risk the process could be tainted by a single
    static juror who does not properly assess the partiality of prospective jurors;
    and by promoting a sense of responsibility in individual jurors and a sense of
    cohesiveness in the jury chosen. <span class=Underline>These potential benefits
    are particularly important to the accused</span>. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there can be advantages to the alternative procedure,
    including the broader exclusion that will be in place if static triers are
    used. In <em>Grant</em> this court stated, also at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>On the other hand, if rotating triers are used, the sworn jurors
    could be tainted by the answers to a challenge for cause given by a prospective
    juror; if static triers are used, none of the members of the jury can be
    tainted by answers given by any other prospective juror.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering these comparisons, two points must be kept in mind.
    First, given that it is the accused who has the option to invoke the method of
    selecting triers, it is the accused who initially balances these perceived
    advantages in deciding which option to seek to invoke. Second, both the category
    of triers and the extent of exclusion must be considered together. If rotating
    triers are to be used, all sworn jurors cannot be excluded because rotating
    triers are sworn jurors – they must be present to hear and determine
    challenges. Accordingly, if an accused wants rotating triers, the accused
    cannot seek exclusion of all jurors; the accused can only seek exclusion of
    unsworn jurors. That is the extent of that option.<a href="#_ftn6"

  <p class=CQuote>Chiheb Esseghaier and Raed Jaser are charged with

    exclude unsworn jurors. He held the only route to exclusion was to exclude
    sworn and unsworn jurors both under s. 640(2.1) which together with s. 640(2.2)
    had removed the court’s pre-2008 discretion to exclude unsworn jurors while
    using rotating triers to preserve impartiality: </span><em>Jaser (Jury
    Selection Ruling)</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 42.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge treated the indication in
    Jaser’s factum and in his dialogue with counsel, that in the event of such a
    ruling Jaser would apply under s. 640(2.1), as the application itself. He made
    an order excluding all sworn and unsworn jurors and requiring the appointment
    of static triers. To make that order, he was satisfied that such an exclusion
    order was “necessary to preserve the impartiality of the jury”: s. 640(2.1); </span><em>Jaser

lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge stated that even if he had the
    discretion to exclude unsworn jurors with rotating triers he would not exercise
    that discretion, since “it would be wrong to make such a limited and
    ineffective common law order, when a full and effective statutory remedy was
    readily available, pursuant to s. 640(2.1).”: </span><em>Jaser (Jury Selection
    Ruling)</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 46. He felt that a limited order
    protecting only prospective jurors from tainting would ignore the danger of tainting
    sworn jurors, which could be addressed under the statutory remedy: </span><em>Jaser

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    ruling, Esseghaier was provided with a memorandum by the trial judge which,
    among other things, stated that if Esseghaier wished to challenge a juror for
    cause and he satisfied the trial judge such a challenge was appropriate, he
    could submit proposed questions for the trial judge to rule upon. The
    memorandum also advised Esseghaier that Jaser had been permitted to challenge
    prospective jurors for cause and that “[y]ou, of course, will have the benefit
    of any of these challenges, if they are successful.” It also described the static
    trier procedure the trial judge ordered.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The jury was selected pursuant to the procedure
    the trial judge ordered. Jaser through counsel participated in the challenges.
    Esseghaier did not participate in the challenges.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-US>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Extent of The Trial Judge’s Error</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parties agree that the trial judge erred
    when he held that he lacked common law discretion to order exclusion of unsworn
    jurors while rotating jurors tried challenges for cause, and that ss. 640(2.1)
    and (2.2) removed the discretion that had existed before those provisions came
    into force. That holding is contradicted by this court’s subsequent decisions,
    starting with </span><em>Grant</em><span lang=EN-US>. The parties disagree,
    however about the extent of that error and its effect. Because the extent of
    the error may impact its effect, I discuss the extent of the error first.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown does not agree that Jaser’s
    application for exclusion of unsworn jurors while using rotating jurors would,
    on a correct view of the law, have necessarily been granted. The Crown relies
    on the fact that the trial judge stated that even if he had a discretion he
    would not have exercised it to grant the application for exclusion of unsworn
    jurors and rotating triers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not agree with the Crown’s position. In
    making the s. 640(2.1) order which he did, the trial judge was satisfied that
    exclusion was necessary for the preservation of impartiality of jurors. </span>Preservation
    of impartiality is a relevant consideration in an application for exclusion of
    unsworn jurors while using rotating triers as well<span lang=EN-US>. The trial
    judge however effectively held that since a s. 640(2.1) order would do a better
    job of preserving impartiality by excluding both sworn and unsworn jurors, an order
    for exclusion of unsworn jurors while using rotating triers should not be made.
    There are several problems with this.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the discretion, properly viewed, was not
    ousted, circumscribed, or altered in any way by the enactment of s. 640(2.1): </span><em>Husbands</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 35. Yet the trial judge’s approach was to compare s.
    640(2.1), which he considered to be a “full and effective statutory remedy”, to
    the more limited exclusion available under the discretion, and to consider the very
    existence of s. 640(2.1) a sufficient reason not to exercise the common law
    discretion. This treats the enactment of s. 640(2.1) as ousting, circumscribing,
    and altering the common law discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unless the accused has applied under s. 640(2.1),
    granting an order under s. 640(2.1) is not an option for the court. Jaser’s
    indication that he would apply under s. 640(2.1) was conditioned on the court
    determining it lacked the jurisdiction to order the exclusion of unsworn jurors
    while using rotating triers. A consideration of whether a discretion to do so
    should be exercised had to be premised on the existence of the jurisdiction and
    therefore no s. 640(2.1) application by Jaser. It was an error of law for the
    trial judge to refuse to exercise a discretion based on a view that a remedy
    not sought by Jaser would have better achieved his ends. Approaching the matter
    in that manner is inconsistent with the existence of the option of using rotating
    triers with unsworn jurors excluded, a jury selection method the accused has
    the right to invoke.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Further, the trial judge gave no consideration
    to the fact that choice of rotating triers necessarily precludes excluding all sworn
    and unsworn jurors. As long as the accused wishes rotating triers, it is beside
    the point to focus on the advantages of full exclusion – those are not advantages
    that can be available with rotating triers. Jaser’s argument noted the benefits
    of rotating triers, particularly the benefit of the jury participating in its
    own selection. That benefit, unavailable if all jurors are excluded, was identified
    by Jaser’s counsel as a reason he was seeking the exclusion of unsworn jurors
    only, and has been identified by this court in </span><em>Grant </em><span
lang=EN-US>as a benefit that is particularly important to the accused. The discretion
    to exclude unsworn jurors while using rotating triers cannot properly be
    refused on the basis that there is a better way to ensure jury impartiality, that
    is, by the exclusion of all jurors, when doing so negates the ability to use
    rotating triers. This approach makes the discretion unavailable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, Esseghaier had not brought a s.
    640(2.1) application. </span><em>Amicus</em><span lang=EN-US> had expressed the
    view on November 27, 2014 that he thought the position taken on behalf of Jaser
    would “help” Esseghaier, but at that point the only position Jaser’s counsel
    had expressed was for rotating triers with exclusion of unsworn jurors. At the
    time, counsel for Jaser had stated that he was not applying under s. 640(2.1).
    Esseghaier himself had said nothing to indicate he was in favour of any method
    of jury selection, let alone that contemplated by s. 640(2.1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, Esseghaier’s rights were the
    default rights in s. 640(2), namely, to rotating triers. Leaving aside the
    issue of whether, if there are two accused and one applies under s. 640(2.1)
    and the other does not, the default rights of one accused to rotating triers
    must always trump the other accused’s application under s. 640(2.1), the
    default rights of one accused are at least a factor to be considered. Granting
    Jaser’s application for exclusion of unsworn jurors while using rotating triers
    would have been consistent with Esseghaier’s default right to rotating triers. The
    trial judge gave no consideration to this.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, in my view, the extent of the trial
    judge’s error is this: he erred in holding that the pre-existing discretion to
    order exclusion of unsworn jurors while challenges for cause are tried by
    rotating triers had been removed, and he erred in stating that he would not
    have exercised the discretion in favour of exclusion of unsworn jurors with
    rotating triers even if he had it. The result is, on the correct legal
    approach, Jaser’s application to exclude unsworn jurors with rotating triers should
    have been granted, and the trial judge erred in not doing so.</span></p>

    judge’s error was an improperly constituted jury; the result of such an error
    is that the verdicts arrived at by a court composed with that jury cannot
    stand. The decisions of this court which have set aside verdicts where a jury
    was selected by static triers without a proper choice by the accused of that
    option are applicable, namely: </span><em>R. v. Noureddine</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2015 ONCA 770, (2015) 128 O.R. (3d) 23 and </span><em>Husbands</em><span
lang=EN-US>. Jaser argues that he made no valid s. 640(2.1) application; the
    trial judge gave effect to his notice that he would bring such an application
    under s. 640(2.1) on the basis of legal errors which deprived Jaser of what he
    really wanted and was entitled to – his statutory right to rotating triers with
    unsworn jurors excluded pursuant to a proper exercise of the common law
    discretion to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em>Amicus</em><span lang=EN-US> argues that Esseghaier made no
    application under s. 640(2.1). He did nothing that was the functional
    equivalent of such an application. Moreover, his default right to rotating
    triers was not considered by the trial judge when he ordered static triers. The
    effect is that the jury was improperly constituted because static triers were
    improperly appointed in respect of Esseghaier. In any event, if the jury was
    improperly constituted for Jaser, it was improperly constituted for both, Jaser
    and Esseghaier.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown argues that the jury was properly
    constituted for Jaser because Jaser made an alternative application under s.
    640(2.1). The trial judge’s error did not deprive Jaser of a choice between his
    two statutory options: rotating triers or static triers. Recognizing that this
    court has dealt with a number of cases where the trial judge entertained a
    mistaken view about the existence or extent of the common law discretion, this case
    has the strongest similarities to those which have allowed verdicts to stand,
    such as </span><em>Grant, R. v. Atkins</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>2017 ONCA 650, 137 O.R. (3d) 1, leave

    jury was properly constituted for him. Jaser made an alternative s. 640(2.1) application
    and since Esseghaier did not participate in the challenges for cause his active
    concurrence to that alternative application was unnecessary.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US> The principle is that where a jury has been selected
    by a challenge for cause procedure “disavowed by an accused, thus depriving him

    triers”, the verdict cannot stand and s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the </span><em>Criminal

lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><em>Noureddine,</em> <span lang=EN-US>the
    accused brought an application for rotating triers and the trial judge
    purported to exercise an inherent jurisdiction, without any application by the
    accused, and over express objection of the accused, to order static triers.
    This court held that there could be no inherent jurisdiction that contradicted
    the requirements of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em> <span lang=EN-US>which
    provide that it is the accused who has to make an application under s. 640(2.1)
    before static triers can be ordered. The result of the error was to render the
    court improperly constituted because the accused was deprived of his statutory
    right in the absence of an application under s. 640(2.1) to be tried by a jury
    selected by rotating triers: at paras. 53-57.</span></p>

    whether the curative proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span lang=EN-US> could be applied. That provision states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong>686(1) </strong><span lang=EN>On the hearing of an

lang=EN-US>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Court gave two reasons why this type of
    error is beyond the reach of the curative proviso. First, an error in the
    method of selecting the jury leads to an improperly constituted court, and thus
    falls outside the curative proviso, which is available to cure errors by a properly
    constituted court: at paras. 52-53 and 61.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the curative proviso can only be applied
    where no prejudice to the accused results from the error. Prejudice means more
    than actual prejudice which, in this type of situation, is not possible to
    gauge as it is not possible to say whether the improper use of static triers
    had any actual effect on the constitution of the jury ultimately selected to
    try the accused. Prejudice includes prejudice to the due administration of
    justice, which the court found to arise from this type of error:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, the prejudice in this case lies in the negative
    effect the improper use of static triers, over the express objection of
    counsel, had on the appearance of the fairness of the proceedings and the due
    administration of justice. Three factors combined to lead me to that
    conclusion:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The use of rotating triers to decide challenges for cause benefits the
    jury selection process;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Static triers are an alternative method used to determine challenges,

  <p class=CQuote>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is for the accused and only the accused to decide whether to initiate
    the motion that may ultimately result in the use of static triers.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=right style='text-align:right'><em>Noureddine</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 64.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Noureddine</em>, the court noted as important to its analysis of
    the applicability of the curative proviso that the accused “did not want to use
    static triers to determine the challenges for cause. They made their position
    clear to the trial judge. It may be that s. 686(1)(b)(iv) could be used if an
    accused had agreed to the use of static triers.… An accused’s willingness to
    use static triers may be enough to render the court properly constituted during
    the selection process.”: para. 57. In <em>Noureddine</em>, the court gave an
    example that this sort of situation could arise where an accused agreed to the
    use of static triers but failed to make a formal application: para. 57.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Husbands</em>, the trial judge ordered static triers in the
    absence of a defence application and in the face of express, repeated statements
    by defence counsel that no application under s. 640(2.1) was being brought and counsel
    wanted rotating triers: at paras. 45 and 50. The verdicts were set aside; the curative
    proviso could not salvage what occurred: para. 49.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The error that occurred here had the same effect as what occurred in <em>Noureddine</em> and <em>Husbands</em>. In <em>Noureddine</em> and <em>Husbands</em>,<em> </em>the
    error imposed static triers on accused who did not want them, did not apply for
    them, and expressly wanted rotating triers with unsworn jurors excluded. The result
    was to deprive the accused of the option of having rotating triers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge’s error deprived Jaser of his option of
    selecting rotating triers with unsworn jurors excluded. When Jaser invoked this
    option, he did so clearly preferring it to static triers in part because it
    involved rotating triers, his statutory right, and in part because it involved
    exclusion under the common law discretion. He made it clear that absent a
    ruling that the option did not exist, a ruling that was in error, he disavowed
    static triers and was expressly making no application that would trigger their
    appointment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The error forced Jaser to elect between the two remaining options, rotating
    triers with no one excluded or static triers with sworn and unsworn jurors both
    excluded, when he ought not to have had to do so. This does not equate to a
    willingness to use static triers with a mere absence of a formal application,
    the situation the court used in <em>Noureddine</em> to describe where the curative
    proviso might apply.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The error also deprived Esseghaier of his default right to rotating
    triers, which he had invoked by doing nothing to select static triers: <em>R.
    v. Swite</em>, 2011 BCCA 54, 268 C.C.C. (3d) 184, at para. 54.</p>

    applied in <em>Noureddine</em> and <em>Husbands</em> is not applicable where on
    a realistic view of what occurred each appellant “got what he wanted” in terms
    of the jury selection procedure. In Jaser’s case his “alternate position” that
    he would apply under s. 640(2.1) reflected what he wanted in the state of
    affairs then existing, that is, the realistic eventuality at the time that the
    trial judge might rule as he did. In Esseghaier’s case, considering that he
    distanced himself from the challenge for cause process completely, it cannot be
    said that he did not get what he wanted. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “accused got what the accused wanted” jurisprudence starts with <em>Grant</em>.
    In <em>Grant</em>, the trial judge ordered the exclusion of all jurors, sworn
    and unsworn, and appointed static triers. There was no formal application under
    s. 640(2.1). The defence had originally requested rotating triers with the
    “panel out”. The trial judge recognized that he had a discretion to so order
    but was given no reason by defence counsel to make that order. Although he took
    a narrower view of the discretion than he ought to have, the “defence had an
    onus to persuade him that the panel should be excluded.… [and] did not put
    forward any reason for doing so.”: para. 49.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court held that the trial judge’s exercise of discretion should not
    be interfered with: para. 49. It went on to state, at paras. 50-51:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Having been given no reason for using rotating triers but
    excluding unsworn jurors, the trial judge gave counsel a choice: rotating
    triers with the panel in, or static triers with the panel out. After briefly consulting
    with each other, defence counsel reversed their earlier position and chose
    static triers. They evidently wanted the jury panel out. Counsel for Grant
    summed up the defence’s position: “[I]f we are stuck with the legislation and
    the Court does not want to exercise discretion to allow rotating triers and the
    jury out, then we’ll take the static triers.”</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The defence did not make a formal application under s. 640(2.1)
    to have the sworn and unsworn panels excluded, and to have the trial judge
    appoint static triers. But I would treat their decision to choose static triers
    as, in effect, an application to exclude both unsworn and sworn jurors.
    Otherwise form would supersede substance. Had the trial judge asked one
    additional question, “Are you then applying for an order under s. 640(2.1)”,
    defence counsel would undoubtedly have answered “yes”.</p>

lang=EN-US>, in my view, it does not support the Crown’s position. In </span><em>Grant</em><span
lang=EN-US>, the trial judge recognized that he had a discretion to exclude
    unsworn jurors with rotating triers and this court found he had made no
    reversible error in refusing to exercise it. The choice he then put to the
    defence – rotating triers with no exclusion, or exclusion of all jurors and
    static triers, and the defence choice of static triers – was not the product of
    legal error on the trial judge’s part, but of the defence failure to provide
    any reason for using rotating triers excluding unsworn jurors. In the case at
    bar, the trial judge erroneously concluded he had no such discretion, and his
    conclusion that if he had a discretion he would not exercise it was flawed. The
    “choice” of static triers with all jurors excluded, which Jaser had given
    notice he would apply for if the court held it did not have the discretion to
    use rotating triers and exclude unsworn jurors, was a choice borne of the trial
    judge’s legal error, rather than a failure of Jaser to support a proper
    exercise of the common law discretion for the option he had invoked.</span></p>

    from the courtroom while using rotating triers. No mention of rotating triers
    was made at all. The only request was to invoke s. 640(2.1), which the trial
    judge granted:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Despite familiarity with the previous practice of discretionary
    exclusion and rotating triers, none of the experienced counsel mentioned, much
    less suggested or sought, trial of the challenge by rotating triers with the
    panel excluded. No one objected to static triers. The only reasonable inference
    in the circumstances is that what mattered most to counsel was that the
    prospective (unsworn) jurors be excluded, not the manner in which the triers of
    the challenge were selected … Trial counsel sought exclusion of prospective
    jurors during the challenge for cause. They achieved the result they sought by
    expressly invoking s. 640(2.1). They made no submissions about the selection
    procedure for the triers of the challenge, saying nothing to indicate a
    preference for rotating over static triers. They cast their lots under s.
    640(2.1). It is too late now to reverse field. <em>Atkins</em>, at paras. 80
    and 85.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no similarity between <em>Atkins</em> and this case.
    Jaser sought rotating triers with unsworn jurors excluded, expressed a clear
    preference for rotating triers, and made submissions on why rotating triers were
    preferable and on why the discretion existed, an argument which was correct. To
    the extent Jaser indicated he would apply under s. 640(2.1), it was only in the
    circumstances of a jury selection procedure option that did exist being held
    not to exist. Jaser did not achieve the result he sought, in the sense used in <em>Atkins</em>.
    Nor are the circumstances in <em>Atkins</em> applicable to Esseghaier.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor in my view is the Crown assisted by this court’s decision in <em>Murray</em>,
    a case that the court considered to be close to the line: para. 56. In <em>Murray</em>,
    the trial judge had erred by indicating that in a challenge for cause there
    were two options: rotating triers with no one excluded or static triers with
    sworn and unsworn jurors excluded. Defence counsel had selected static triers
    when told these were his two options. Although there was a third option,
    rotating triers with the unsworn jurors excluded from the courtroom, “[a]t no
    point did defence counsel object to the use of static triers or say that he did
    not wish static triers.… [D]efence counsel’s primary request was that unsworn
    prospective jurors be excluded from the courtroom during the trial of the
    challenge for cause.… [D]efence counsel never rejected the use of static triers.…
    [H]e appeared satisfied with the trial judge’s proposal about how the static
    triers would be selected.”: paras. 57, 63 and 65.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The circumstances here differ markedly from those in<em> Murray</em>.
    Jaser had rejected the use of static triers by arguing in favour of rotating
    triers and expressly disclaiming any application for them except in a
    circumstance that is the result of the error in question. Whereas in <em>Murray</em> the primary request was exclusion, here Jaser’s request was also premised on
    the advantages of rotating triers themselves.</p>

class=MsoPageNumber> 2017 ONCA 68, defence counsel stated that he wanted prospective
    jurors excluded. Counsel was told by the trial judge that his preference was
    for static triers but was invited to make submissions on rotating triers.
    Counsel responded that he mainly wanted the panel excluded and “actually like[d]”
    static triers: at para. 8. Defence counsel went on to discuss with Crown
    counsel the steps to vet static triers and after the trial judge indicated the
    triers could be vetted stated: “then I think that would accommodate my biggest
    concerns”: at para. 9. An appeal based on the use of static triers without a
    formal application under s. 640(2.1) failed on the basis that the defence “got
    what it wanted”. That conclusion is inapplicable here.</span></p>

    the court stated at para. 28: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the case before us, as in <em>Mansingh</em>, Kossyrine
    wanted static triers. Unlike in <em>Noureddine,</em> Kossyrine did not ask for
    rotating triers or object to the trial judge’s practice of using static triers.
    His sole concern was that the static triers the trial judge identified be
    properly vetted. This court’s conclusion in <em>Mansingh</em> is entirely
    appropriate in this case: “[c]ounsel got what he wanted and, in substance, if
    not in form, made the requisite application under s. 640(2.1)”. The jury in
    this case was thus properly constituted.</p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s error here took one of the three options, the
    exclusion of unsworn jurors while using rotating triers, away from Jaser. Jaser
    sought that option. He made a case for it and was entitled to it. Unlike the
    cases the Crown relies upon, it did not become unavailable to him because he
    failed to mention it, failed to express a preference for it, failed to support
    a proper exercise of discretion to obtain it, failed to object to static
    triers, or because he actually liked static triers. On a substance over form
    basis, what Jaser wanted was this option. He did not get it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give the alternative request of Jaser for static triers the
    effect the Crown contends for. It became operative only due to a legal error by
    the trial judge, one Jaser had attempted to prevent from occurring. At the
    point that his notice that he would pursue the alternative of a s. 640(2.1)
    application became operative, that is, the trial judge’s ruling that he lacked
    the discretion that he in law had, Jaser had already been deprived of his
    preferred option to invoke a method of selecting the composition of triers that
    the law entitled him to select. A choice of which of the remaining options
    should be used, in those circumstances, cannot cure the error. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do I agree with the Crown that the jury was properly constituted for
    Esseghaier because he did not participate in the challenge for cause process.
    The Crown’s analogy to its inability to challenge an acquittal of an accused by
    an improperly constituted jury, because the Crown is a bystander to the
    challenge for cause process, is not apt. The right to use rotating triers is a
    right which is personal to the accused. The improper use of static triers can
    only create rights in an accused to challenge convictions, not in the Crown to
    challenge acquittals: <em>Noureddine</em>, at paras. 73-87.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, one jury was selected for both appellants. In the circumstances of
    this case, as the jury was not properly constituted for Jaser, it cannot be
    considered to have been properly constituted for Esseghaier.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the curative proviso cannot be applied in this case. As
    pointed out in <em>Noureddine</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>beyond the issue of the curative proviso’s<em> </em>application to a
    question that affects the proper constitution of the jury, and thus of the
    court which tried the appellants, the curative proviso cannot be applied unless
    there was no prejudice to the accused. As in <em>Noureddine</em>, the question
    here is not actual prejudice, which in these kinds of circumstances is
    impossible to gauge, but prejudice to the due administration of justice flowing
    from the denial of a jury selection method which was in law properly invoked: <em>Noureddine</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>at paras. 62-64. The type of
    “willingness” or agreement to the use of static triers discussed in <em>Noureddine </em>as a reason why the curative proviso might be applicable are not present
    here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeals, set aside the convictions and direct a new
