    ONSC 1256, 46 C.C.E.L. (4th) 207.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Fairburn J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent worked for the appellant, a large
    commercial real estate company, from September 2001 to August 2004, when he
    left for other employment. He returned to the appellant’s employ in February
    2009 as a Senior Associate and was quickly promoted to the position of Managing
    Director. The terms of his employment included a base salary and yearly bonus.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not in dispute that the respondent’s
    employment was terminated without cause on January 19, 2017. Nor is it in
    dispute that upon termination the respondent received what he was entitled to
    under the <em>Employment Standards Act</em><i>, <em>2000</em></i>, S.O. 2000,
    c. 41<i> </i>(“<em>ESA</em>”), including a lump-sum payment in lieu of notice
    of termination representing eight weeks of salary, coverage for all benefits
    during that notice period, and a lump-sum severance payment representing about
    12 weeks of salary. Despite having received a bonus for each year that he had
    been employed as a Managing Director, the respondent did not receive any
    compensation for the bonus he would have earned for the period of time that he
    worked between the start of the new year and his termination (January 1 to 19,
    2017) or for the period of time that was covered by notice under the <em>ESA</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent brought an action for wrongful
    dismissal. The parties agreed that the matter could be resolved by way of
    summary judgment. The respondent argued that he was owed damages for: (a)
    reasonable notice under the common law; (b) benefits he would have been
    entitled to during that reasonable notice period; and (c) the bonus he would
    have earned as an integral and non-discretionary part of his compensation
    package. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent argued that the termination
    provision in his employment agreement is unenforceable because it attempts to contract
    out of employment standards in the <em>ESA</em>. Given the unenforceability of
    the termination provision, the respondent said that he was entitled to a period
    of notice in accordance with what was reasonable under the common law. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The termination provision is found within clause
    four of the employment agreement: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>4. Term of Employment</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The company may terminate the employment of
    the Managing Director by providing the Managing Director <u>the greater of</u> the Managing Director’s entitlement pursuant to the Ontario <i>Employment
    Standards Act </i><u>or</u>, at the Company’s sole discretion, <u>either</u> of
    the following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>a. Two (2) months
    working notice, in which case the Managing Director will continue to perform
    all of his duties and his compensation and benefits will remain unchanged
    during the working notice period.  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>b. Payment in lieu
    of notice in the amount equivalent of two (2) months Base Salary. [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>Throughout these reasons, I will refer
    to the first part of the termination clause –“entitlement pursuant to the Ontario
    [<em>ESA</em>]” – as the “first<i> </i>clause”, and to clauses 4(a) and 4(b) by
    those names.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I read the motion judge as coming to two central
    conclusions in determining that the respondent was owed damages reflecting his base
    salary for a period of eight months, minus twelve weeks he had already been
    compensated.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the motion judge made a finding that the
    termination clause could reduce “the benefits to which [the respondent] could
    be entitled on termination to something less than he would be entitled to under
    the <em>ESA</em>.” Among other things, she found that upon termination the respondent
    would be entitled to both benefits and severance under the <em>ESA</em><i>. </i>Yet,
    if clause 4(a) applied, it did not provide for severance and, if clause 4(b)
    applied, it did not provide for benefits. (I would add that clause 4(b) does
    not appear to provide for severance either.) Accordingly, she concluded that
    the <em>ESA</em><i> </i>had been contracted out of and the entire termination
    clause is unenforceable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, despite having already made the finding
    that the <em>ESA</em><i> </i>had been contracted out of, the motion judge went
    on to make an alternative finding that, at its very “best”, the termination
    clause was unclear as to whether clauses 4(a) and 4(b) included statutorily-compliant
    severance and benefits. On that alternative basis, the motion judge found that
    the respondent would not have known the nature of his entitlements with
    certainty at the time he signed the employment agreement (in particular, he
    would not have known whether he would be paid severance if clause 4(a) were
    applied, or if he would be paid benefits if clause 4(b) were applied). Accordingly,
    she concluded that the termination clause did not clearly satisfy the
    obligation to pay the respondent his statutory entitlements and, therefore, the
    clause was unenforceable on this basis as well.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although damages for lost benefits would
    typically be granted for the duration of the applicable notice period, the
    motion judge found that the respondent had failed to provide evidence of actual
    loss incurred as a consequence of his loss of benefits during the eight-month
    period she imposed. This resulted in a refusal to order damages to be paid for
    lost benefits during that time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for the bonus, the motion judge found as a
    fact that it was an integral and non-discretionary part of the respondent’s
    compensation package over the almost eight years he had been a Managing
    Director. The motion judge therefore concluded that the respondent was entitled
    to compensation for the bonus he earned while he was still employed and for the
    bonus he would have earned during the eight-month notice period to which she
    found he was entitled at common law.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals on the basis of two
    alleged errors: </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the motion judge erred by deciding that the
    termination clause was unenforceable; and </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the motion judge erred by concluding that the respondent
    should receive a <em>pro rata</em><i> </i>share of his bonus for the period he
    worked from January 1 to January 19, 2017 and for the eight-month period of
    reasonable notice under the common law. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent cross-appeals, contending that
    the motion judge erred by failing to grant him compensation for his loss of
    benefits during the eight-month period of notice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the
    appeal should be dismissed and the cross-appeal granted.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Motion Judge Did Not Err in Finding the

  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellant’s Position</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the facts of this case, the <em>ESA</em><i> </i>required
    the appellant to provide the following to the respondent:</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>eight weeks’ notice or pay in lieu of notice
    (ss. 57(1)(h), 60(1)(a), 60(1)(b), 61(1)(a));<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a></span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>eight weeks’ continuation of benefits (ss.
    57(1)(h), 60(1)(c), 61(1)(b)); and</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> eleven weeks’ severance pay (ss. 63(1), 64(1)(a),
    65(1), 65(2), 65(4)).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the termination clause
    provides at least the statutory minimum amount of pay in lieu of notice and
    preserves the statutory entitlements to severance pay and continuation of
    benefits. The appellant contends that, regardless of whether the “greater”
    entitlement was under the first clause or clauses 4(a) or 4(b), the termination
    clause ensured that the respondent would always receive his minimum statutory
    entitlements under the <em>ESA</em>. The appellant characterizes the reference
    to the “greater of” at the outset of the termination clause as the “failsafe”
    clause, meaning that even if clauses 4(a) or 4(b) applied, the minimum
    statutory entitlements relating to benefits and severance would be provided
    under those clauses. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant suggests that the motion judge
    made three extricable errors of law, reviewable on a correctness standard, in her
    interpretation of the termination clause: (a) she failed to interpret the
    clause as a whole; (b) she read ambiguity into clauses 4(a) and 4(b) where
    there was none; and (c) she failed to appreciate that there was no need for a
    specific reference to statutory entitlements in clauses 4(a) and 4(b) for those
    entitlements to apply. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I will now explain why I do not accept that the
    motion judge committed an extricable error of law in her interpretation of the
    termination clause. In the absence of an extricable error of law, the motion
    judge’s interpretation of the contract is entitled to deference: <em>Sattva

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    of the statutory entitlements. The appellant maintains that the first clause,
    which imports <em>ESA</em> entitlements by specific reference, also cloaks

    the first clause on other occasions. Her reasons demonstrate her conclusion
    that she interpreted the word “or” as separating the first clause from clauses 4(a)

    light of the disjunctive nature of the clause, it was open to the motion judge
    to find that the first clause did not cast the <em>ESA</em><i> </i>statutory
    entitlements upon clauses 4(a) and 4(b). </span></p>

    would have been entitled to severance had clause 4a applied on his termination,
    and employee benefits had clause 4b then applied.” This statement, however,
    must be read in its context. The motion judge immediately went on to observe
    that when a termination clause is unclear or can be interpreted in more than
    one way, courts should prefer the interpretation that favours the employee: <em>Ceccol
    v. Ontario Gymnastics Federation</em> (2001), 55 O.R. (3d) 614 (C.A.), at

    (4th) 542, at para. 12. Read contextually, I understand the motion judge’s
    reference to “at best” to mean that, because clauses 4(a) and 4(b) did not
    clearly include <em>ESA</em><i> </i>entitlements, the best the appellant could
    argue was that there was ambiguity and that the clauses should be interpreted
    to include those entitlements. She rightly rejected that argument. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    for the motion judge to consider ambiguity. The termination clause was
    unenforceable given that it contracted out of statutory entitlements without
    substituting a greater benefit: <em>Wood</em>, at para. 21. Given that the
    parties addressed the ambiguity point, though, I will also briefly address it. </span></p>

    erred in straining to find ambiguity where there was none. In support of this
    argument, the appellant relies upon <em>Amberber</em>, at paras. 54 and 62,
    where this court commented upon a “failsafe provision” that served to modify the
    other parts of a termination clause, reading them up to comply with the <em>ESA</em>.
    The appellant says that this case is analogous to <i>Amberber </i>in the sense
    that the first clause modifies the whole termination clause, so that the <em>ESA</em><i> </i>minimum entitlements apply to clauses 4(a) and 4(b). </span></p>

    failsafe provision in <em>Amberber</em><i> </i>fell at the end of the “Termination
    of Employment” clause and read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the event that the applicable provincial
    employment standard legislation provides you with superior entitlements upon

    the first clause to “entitlement pursuant to the Ontario [<em>ESA</em>]” does
    not cloak the entire termination clause. Rather, it is stranded within the
    first clause, a clause that the motion judge found provided for different
    entitlements than clauses 4(a) and 4(b).  </span></p>

    the first clause <u>or</u> the latter clauses, combined with elements of the
    first clause. Although she was not required to do so, I can see no error in the
    motion judge’s finding that, even when clauses 4(a) and 4(b) were taken at
    their very “best” for the appellant, they contained a lack of clarity about
    whether the appellant had to pay statutory severance under clause 4(a) and
    statutory benefits under clause 4(b). I agree with the motion judge that when
    the respondent signed the employment contract, at its very best from the
    appellant’s perspective, the termination provision was not explicit and the
    respondent would not have known with certainty what his entitlements at the end
    of his employment would be. As Laskin J.A. observed in <em>Wood</em>, at para.

    did not work so as to exclude those entitlements. As Gillese J.A. said in <em>Roden</em>,<i> </i>at para. 59, while the termination clause did not address benefit plan
    contributions during the notice period, it was “silent in respect of the
    obligation to provide benefits” and did not attempt to limit the employer’s
    obligation. Similarly, Roberts J.A. said in <em>Nemeth</em>,<i> </i>at para. 15:
    “I do not accept that the silence of the termination clause concerning the [employee’s]

    applicable employment standards”, yet no such reference is made in clauses 4(a)
    and 4(b). She concluded that <em>Nemeth</em><i> </i>is distinguishable from
    this case on the basis that the termination clause only attempted to limit the
    amount of notice that the employee would have received on termination, but not
    other statutory entitlements under the <em>ESA</em><i>. </i>The motion judge
    noted that “in the case at bar, unlike <em>Nemeth</em>, there is no referential

    same ground. Again, the <em>ESA</em><i> </i>entitlements are stuck within the

    for such language in order to find that the statutory entitlements do not apply.
    The overriding question is whether the termination clause purports to limit the
    minimum statutory obligations: <em>Nemeth</em>,<i> </i>at para. 15. The focus
    of the inquiry is on what the parties actually agreed to. While clauses 4(a)
    and 4(b) may provide an employee with more notice than the first clause, when the

    notice. Rather, it makes specific reference to “compensation and benefits”
    being unchanged during the working notice period. Yet clause 4(b) makes no
    reference to benefits. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the
    clauses merely suffer from silence as to statutory entitlements. Clause 4(a)

lang=EN-CA>sets out a two-part test at paras. 30-31 to determine whether
    damages in lieu of a bonus should be given. The first step is to determine the
    employee’s common law right. The motion judge concluded that in the circumstances
    of this case, where the bonus was such an integral aspect of the respondent’s
    compensation, he had a common law entitlement to the bonus he earned or would
    have earned. That finding is not challenged on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second step is to ask whether there is
    something in the bonus plan that removes the employee’s common law entitlement.
    The appellant argues that the motion judge erred by focusing only upon the
    words “good standing”. The appellant contends that, although the respondent may
    well have been in “good standing” during the notice period, that notice period
    ended before when the bonus was “payable”. Accordingly, because the
    respondent’s bonus for 2017 was not payable until February 2018 and because the
    parties agreed that the respondent needed to be “an employee in good standing
    with the company at the time bonuses are payable”, the appellant argues that
    the parties contracted out of the common law entitlement to damages for any
    bonus the respondent earned or would have earned in 2017. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would reject this argument. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Where a bonus is a non-discretionary and integral
    part of the employee’s compensation package, damages for wrongful dismissal should
    include both the bonus actually earned before being terminated and the bonus
    that would have been earned during the notice period, unless the terms of the
    bonus plan alter or remove that right: see <em>Paquette</em>, at paras. 16-18;<i> <em>Taggart v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</em></i> (2006), 50 C.C.P.B. 163 (Ont.
    C.A.), at paras. 12-15; <em>Manastersky v. Royal Bank of Canada</em>, 2019 ONCA
    609, at paras. 40-43. Although I agree that one could contract out of the
    requirement to pay a portion of a yearly bonus based upon what a terminated
    employee earned while he was working and would have earned during a notice
    period, that contract would have to be clear on its face. As noted in <em>Paquette</em>,
    at para. 31, the “question is not whether the contract or plan is ambiguous,
    but whether the wording of the plan unambiguously alters or removes the
    appellant’s common law rights”: see also <em>Lin v. Ontario Teachers’ Pension
    Plan Board</em><i>, </i>2016 ONCA 619, 352 O.A.C. 10, at para. 89. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is nothing in the wording of the
    employment agreement in this case to suggest that the common law right to
    damages for lost bonus potential in the wake of a termination without cause was
    contracted out of. I see no error in the motion judge’s finding that the “good
    standing clause” is tantamount to the “actively employed” clause in <em>Paquette</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted in <em>Paquette</em>, at para. 16,

    at p. 589. Support for this proposition can be found in <em>Bain v. UBS
    Securities Canada Inc</em><i>.</i>, 2018 ONCA 190, 46 C.C.E.L. (4th) 50, albeit
    in a different context involving a deferred bonus plan. In <em>Bain</em><i>, </i>this
    court determined that a bonus “earned” by way of notional shares during a
    notice period could vest after the notice period ended. The appellant employer
    argued that the dismissed employee was only entitled to damages for lost bonus
    in respect of amounts he would have actually received prior to his termination
    and during the notice period. The court determined, at para. 15, that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[W]hile the notional shares would not have
    vested before the end of the reasonable notice period, there is no question
    that the bonus was “earned” by Bain during that period. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Absent a contracting out, allowing for common
    law damages that include compensation in lieu of a <em>pro rata</em> share of a
    bonus in circumstances where the bonus is an integral part of the compensation
    package is the only sensible approach. Although the notice period in this case
    ended a few months before the bonus would have come due, one can well imagine a
    scenario in which the notice period could expire on the very eve of the bonus payment
    date. In those circumstances, the appellant’s position would lead to the
    untenable result that the dismissed employee would get no part of the bonus he
    or she had earned through a combination of his or her labour during that
    calendar year and over the course of the notice period that followed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The greater the bonus in relation to the
    employee’s overall compensation and the shorter the notice period, the greater
    the unfairness of the situation. By way of example, if the appellant is right,
    then an employee who is terminated in early December, but only eligible to a
    couple of weeks of notice, would not be eligible to seek damages for a <em>pro
    rata</em><i> </i>share of his or her bonus for the eleven months of work he or
    she completed and the short notice period that followed. Absent clear language
    in the contract, I do not accept the inherent unfairness that would arise in
    precluding those employees terminated without cause from seeking a <em>pro rata</em><i> </i>share of their bonuses only by virtue of the fact that the notice period ended
    before the bonus payment date, particularly where the bonus payment date is
    entirely in the discretion of the employer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the question is not whether the
    bonus would have been “received” during the notice period, but whether it
    whether it was “earned” or “would have been earned” during that period. Damages
    may be sought as compensation for what an employee would have earned had his or
    her contract of employment not be breached. This reasoning is similar to <em>Taggart</em><i> </i>where an active service prerequisite to the accrual of pension benefits did
    not preclude damages for lost pension benefits during the notice period after
    wrongful dismissal. As noted by Sharpe J.A. in <em>Taggart</em>, it is
    important to recall the legal nature of the claim. In <em>Taggart</em><i>, </i>the
    legal nature of the claim was not for the benefits themselves, but for “damages
    as compensation for the … benefits the [employee] would have <u>earned</u> had
    the [employer] not breached the contract of employment”: at para. 16 (emphasis
    added). Equally, the claim here was not for the bonus itself, but for the share
    of the bonus that the respondent would have earned had the appellant not
    breached the contract of employment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not read the <em>Paquette</em><i> </i>decision
    as turning on the narrow point that the dismissed employee was still within the
    notice period when the bonus came due. The fact is that the dismissed employee
    in <em>Paquette</em><i> </i>only claimed damages in lieu of his bonus for the
    periods of time when it would have come due while the notice period was still
    operative. The reasons in <em>Paquette</em><i> </i>are responsive to that
    position. The decision should not be read, though, as being limited to only
    those cases where the notice period continues to run at the time when the bonus
    would have otherwise come due if the employee had not been terminated without
    cause. </span></p>

    Nordstrong Equipment Limited</em><i>, </i>2018 ONCA 364, 47 C.C.E.L. (4th) 218

    bonus potential. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Lin</em>, a decision released on the same
    day as <em>Paquette</em><i>, </i>this court considered a similar issue to what
    is now raised by the appellant. The trial judge had awarded damages for bonuses
    that the employee would have received under two bonus compensation plans
    constituting about 60 percent of his annual compensation. The bonus payments
    were given in April of each year for the “performance period” ending on
    December 31 of the previous year: <em>Lin</em><i>, </i>at para. 58. The
    employee was terminated in March 2011 and was ultimately granted a 15-month
    period of reasonable notice. That meant that the notice period extended to June
    2012. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge awarded damages for the bonuses that
    the employee would have received under the two different plans in April 2011
    and April 2012. He also granted damages for the bonus the employee would have
    received under one of the plans for the period of time between January 1 and June
    22, 2012. On appeal, this court rejected the employer’s argument that language
    in the bonus plans about termination disentitled the employee from receiving
    any bonus compensation once he was terminated. It determined that the employee was
    entitled to compensation for lost bonuses under the plans, including the <em>pro
    rata</em><i> </i>share under the one plan for the period from January 1 to June
    22, 2012, because, absent clear language limiting a terminated employee’s
    common law rights, an employee is entitled to “the bonus he or she would have
    earned during the period of reasonable notice, as a component of damages for
    wrongful dismissal”: <em>Lin</em><i>, </i>at para. 89. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Equally, in <em>Singer</em>, this court
    concluded that the appellant employee should receive damages for the lost
    opportunity to earn his bonus during the entire notice period, including a
    period of time that would have exceeded the yearly bonus payout. In setting
    aside the motion judge’s decision rejecting the employee’s claim for an amount
    to compensate him for the loss of that bonus, Feldman J.A. concluded that there
    was nothing in the employment contract that removed the employee’s entitlement
    to a full share of the bonus he would have earned during the notice period. </span></p>

    on a <em>pro rata</em><i> </i>basis for part of a bonus year, the fact remains
