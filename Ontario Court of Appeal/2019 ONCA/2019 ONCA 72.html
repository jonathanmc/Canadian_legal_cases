  <p class=Heard>Heard: January 25, 2019</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on May 26, 2014 and
    the sentence imposed on December 12, 2014 by Justice B.A. Allen of the Superior
    Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=Judge align=center style='text-align:center'><strong><span
style='font-weight:normal'>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of a series of sexual and violent offences
    against the complainant. The offences occurred in the context of a two-year
    sexual relationship. The complainant was aged 12-14 years at the time of the
    offences, and therefore legally incapable of consenting to the sexual relations,
    while the appellant was aged 27-29. The trial judge imposed sentences totalling
    8 years. The complainant first met the appellant when she would come to his
    mother’s apartment to play with his younger sister. The complainant’s household
    was highly dysfunctional, and although she was intermittently in the care of
    Native Child and Family Services (NCFS), she was frequently truant and living
    clandestinely with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appealed against both conviction and sentence. At the
    conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed the conviction appeal and allowed the
    sentence appeal in part, with reasons to follow. These are those reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Conviction appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the appeal against conviction, the appellant argues that
    the trial judge erred by:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>relying on photographic evidence
    that had not been authenticated;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>rendering an unreasonable
    conviction under the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(i) by relying on the complainant’s
    evidence, given her inconsistent statements and admitted perjury;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>relying on evidence from the
    complainant’s mother and stepfather, despite finding them to be unreliable
    witnesses;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>misapprehending the evidence that
    the complainant had been coached in her police statement by the NCFS and had a
    motive to lie.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree with the submissions.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The
    photographs:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the photographs, it was not necessary that they be
    authenticated by evidence from the person who took the photographs. They were
    capable of being authenticated by the evidence of the complainant, who was able
    to identify herself and the appellant in the photographs, explain the
    interactions depicted, and the locations at which the photographs were taken. She
    was also able to provide a reasoned explanation for the approximate date range
    she gave for the photographs, and her belief that her sister was the likely
    photographer. The trial judge made no error in receiving the photographs into
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The reasonableness of the conviction:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant focuses on the nature and number of admitted lies the
    complainant told the police and repeated at the preliminary inquiry. The trial
    judge was alive to the untruthful statements and carefully considered both the
    complainant’s explanations for them and the circumstances surrounding the
    recantations. The trial judge found that the complainant’s admitted lies did
    not negate her credibility or reliability on the central issue: she and the
    appellant had engaged in sexual intercourse approximately 300 times over a
    two-year sexual relationship, and the appellant had on various occasions physically
    assaulted her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argued that the trial judge erred by finding that the
    complainant’s lies actually made her more credible than she would have been
    without the lies. We do not agree with this reading of the trial judge’s
    reasons. The trial judge expressed concern about the effect of the untruthful
    statements on the complainant’s credibility. In stating that the “recantations
    have a redeeming feature” and cast “a somewhat more positive light on her
    general credibility”, she was merely stating that the complainant’s
    acknowledgment and recantation of the lies had some ameliorative effect. It is
    not open to us to interfere with the trial judge’s credibility assessment.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The parents’ evidence:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the complainant’s parents’ evidence as to the sexual
    relationship between the appellant and the complainant, it was open to the
    trial judge to rely on the parents’ evidence where it was supported by other
    credible evidence, notwithstanding her finding that the parents’ substance
    abuse made their evidence generally unreliable. The evidence of the parents that
    the trial judge was willing to accept was consistent with the photographic
    evidence and the evidence she accepted from other sources, including the
    complainant, the NCFS, and the police. The trial judge viewed the parents’
    evidence as providing some additional support for evidence from sources that she
    found more reliable. She did not err in doing so.</p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'>The evidence
    of motive to lie:</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument rests on the trial judge’s statement at paragraph 58 of
    her reasons that “(t)here is no substantiation” for the defence theory that the
    complainant fabricated the claims she made to the police as part of a deal with
    the NCFS to secure her independence from them. There is, as the appellant
    argues, some evidence that could have supported that allegation. However, we do
    not read the trial judge’s reasons as denying this. Rather, she concluded that in
    light of the totality of the evidence that she accepted, she could not draw the
    inference urged by the defence. The trial judge made no error in so finding.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Sentence appeal</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant advances multiple arguments on the sentence appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant was in a position of trust or authority
    over the complainant, which is an aggravating factor under s. 718.2(a)(iii) of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The appellant disputes this, arguing that he was
    simply a neighbour trying to help the complainant through a difficult home
    life, and ended up romantically involved with her. We do not agree. As the
    trial judge found, the appellant made himself a confidante for a troubled and
    vulnerable 12 year old girl. He “provided places of refuge and protection from
    neglectful parents who were adrift in their own world of substance abuse.” She
    stopped going to school and to her family home in order to spend all her time
    with him. He facilitated her flight from the NCFS and kept her in hiding. She
    was wholly dependent upon him for companionship, food, and shelter. He made
    himself, in the trial judge’s words, “her world”. The trial judge made no error
    in characterizing the relationship as one of trust, coming within s.
    718.2(a)(iii). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge inappropriately considered the complainant’s
    age as an aggravating factor under s. 718.2(a)(ii.1) with respect to the sexual
    interference conviction, which necessarily involves the abuse of a person under
    the age of 16. The complainant’s age was relevant to assessing her degree of
    vulnerability, and the age difference was relevant to assessing the appellant’s
    degree of culpability. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in considering the appellant’s
    conviction for arson as an aggravating factor, given that the conviction
    post-dated the conduct for which the appellant was sentenced. The Crown
    concedes, properly, that this was an error, but argues that it did not have an
    impact on the appellant’s sentence. We agree. Although it was an error to
    consider post-offence conduct, we are not persuaded that it had any impact on
    sentencing. The fact of the arson conviction was listed as part of an extensive
    criminal record, which was itself only one of ten aggravating factors
    considered by the trial judge. Additionally, it was not an error for the trial
    judge to consider the arson conviction when assessing his rehabilitative
    potential.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in relying on facts that were
    not in evidence, specifically, facts related to the appellant’s subsequent
    conviction for sexual offences. Again, it was not an error for the trial judge,
    in assessing the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation, to consider his
    conduct when he was on bail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues, and we agree, that the trial judge erred in failing to comply
    with s. 726 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> and ask the appellant if he had
    anything to say. We are not satisfied, however, that this error had any impact
    on sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    significantly, the appellant argues that the sentence imposed is unfit, falling
    outside the appropriate range. We do not agree. This ground of appeal is
    largely exhausted by our rejection of the argument that the trial judge erred
    in finding the appellant to have been in a position of trust. In any event,
    given the complainant’s vulnerability, the appellant’s domination of her, the
    disparity in ages, the duration of the abuse, and the instances of violence
    (including choking the complainant and punching her in the face), we do not
    agree that the sentence is unfit.</p>

    crown concedes, and we agree, that the trial judge erred in failing to give the
    appellant credit for 105 days of pre-trial custody, which when calculated on a
    1.5:1 basis, should have resulted in a credit of 158 days.</p>

    appeal as to conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is allowed, and
    the sentence appeal is allowed only with respect to credit for pre-trial
    custody. The sentence appeal is dismissed in all other respects.</p>
