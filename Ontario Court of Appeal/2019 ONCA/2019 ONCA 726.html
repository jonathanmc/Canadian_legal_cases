  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent, Ammaan Charley, was found guilty
    of robbery with a firearm and related offences. Subsequent to the findings of
    guilt, but before sentence, the respondent brought a motion to stay the
    proceedings, claiming that his right to be tried within a reasonable time had
    been denied as a result of post-verdict delay. The trial judge granted the
    motion and stayed the proceedings. In doing so, he applied the presumptive
    30-month ceiling established in <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1
    S.C.R. 631 to the period beginning with the laying of the charge and extending
    to the anticipated date of sentencing. After deducting certain periods, the
    trial judge calculated the net delay at 32 months. He went on to hold that the
    Crown had not discharged its onus of showing that the delay was reasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown appeals. The Crown accepts that s.
    11(b) applies throughout the trial process, including through sentencing. Crown
    counsel maintains, however, that post-verdict delay must be treated separately
    from pre-verdict delay and is not subject to the presumptive ceilings
    established in <em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>. Counsel
    contends that the onus of demonstrating the reasonableness of post-verdict
    delay is always on the defence and falls to be determined by the test set down
    in </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> for delay
    that is below the </span></em>presumptive ceilings. The Crown submits that the
    defence failed to show that the post-verdict delay was unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The application of the <em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> analysis to post-verdict delay is an open question
    in this court. For the reasons that follow, I would hold that while the </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> analysis does apply to post-verdict delay, the
    presumptive ceilings established in </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> do not include post-verdict delay. Post-verdict
    delay, for the purposes of applying a presumptive ceiling, should be assessed
    separately from pre-verdict delay and should be subject to its own presumptive
    ceiling. I would fix that ceiling at five months. Applying that approach to
    this case, the post-verdict delay was not unreasonable. </span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>With respect to
    the order this court should make, I am satisfied that this court has the
    jurisdiction to set aside the stay and either order a new trial, or affirm the
    finding of guilt and either sentence the respondent, or remit the matter to the
    trial court for sentence. I would set aside the stay, affirm the findings of
    guilt and remit the matter to the trial court for sentence. </span></em></p>

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>factual background:
    the robbery</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown alleged that the respondent and an
    accomplice robbed a clerk in a convenience store at gunpoint. The Crowns case
    relied primarily on the evidence of the clerk, Glassford Gordon.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gordon testified that the respondent and a
    younger man entered the store together at about 5:30 p.m. As soon as they
    entered, the young man came over the counter and attacked Mr. Gordon. As Mr.
    Gordon struggled with the young man, he saw the respondent pointing a gun at
    him. The respondent pushed the young man out of the way and said to Mr. Gordon,
    wheres the money?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent pushed Mr. Gordon toward the back
    of the store and continued to demand money. He struck Mr. Gordon on the head
    with the handgun twice, opening a significant gash on his head. The respondent
    also pulled a gold chain from Mr. Gordons neck and gave it to the young man.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent continued to demand money. At one
    point, the respondent gave the gun to the young man, telling him to watch Mr.
    Gordon. The respondent had taken some keys from Mr. Gordon and was trying to open
    a door with one of the keys.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the young man became distracted, Mr. Gordon
    grabbed the gun and ran into the alleyway behind the store. The respondent and
    the young man gave chase. The respondent grabbed the hand in which Mr. Gordon
    was holding the gun. They fell to the ground while struggling for the gun. The
    gun discharged twice. Fortunately, no one was hit. The young man, at the
    respondents urging, joined in the struggle for the gun, stomping on Mr.
    Gordons hand and grabbing the muzzle of the gun.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gordon was determined to hold onto the gun,
    despite the attack by the respondent and the young man. When the police arrived
    at the scene in response to a 911 call, they found the respondent and Mr.
    Gordon in the alleyway on the ground, fighting for control of the gun.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gordons evidence was supported in several respects
    by the physical and forensic evidence, and the evidence of a witness who saw the
    beginning of the attack in the store and the last stages of the struggle for
    the gun in the alleyway. That witness had called 911 immediately after she fled
    the store.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent testified in his own defence. He
    indicated that he had been in the same store the previous day to purchase marijuana
    from Mr. Gordon. While he was there, a group of men robbed the store. He had
    nothing to do with the robbery and just happened to be in the wrong place at
    the wrong time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his evidence, Mr. Gordon confirmed that a
    group of masked men had robbed him the day before. The respondent was in the
    store at the time. He was not masked, and as far as Mr. Gordon could tell, was
    not involved in the robbery.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent testified that he went back to
    the same store to purchase more marijuana the next day. He was with his girlfriend
    and a young man. They arrived in a taxi. His girlfriend stayed in the taxi
    while the respondent and the young man went into the store. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As soon as the respondent and the young man entered
    the store, the young man ran toward the clerk, jumped over the counter, and attacked
    him. It was the respondents evidence that, for the second day in a row, he had
    the misfortune of being in the store during a robbery in which he was not
    involved.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent indicated that as soon as he
    realized that the young man was trying to rob the store, he ran out of the
    front door onto the street. He wanted nothing to do with the robbery. He did
    not return to the taxi where his girlfriend was waiting for him but instead
    walked in the other direction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the respondent, he walked a short
    distance away from the store. He was standing on the street trying to decide
    what to do when he heard gunshots. He walked back to the store and saw Mr.
    Gordon and the young man fighting in the alleyway. The respondent decided to
    help the young man, who seemed to be losing the fight. The respondent and Mr.
    Gordon were struggling for possession of the gun in the alleyway when the
    police arrived in response to a 911 call.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent denied that he was ever in
    possession of the gun and claimed to have no knowledge of the gun. In
    cross-examination, the defence suggested to Mr. Gordon that he had the gun
    because, as a drug dealer, he needed to protect himself. He denied the
    suggestion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge disbelieved the respondents
    evidence. He went on to conclude, based on the rest of the evidence, including
    Mr. Gordons testimony, that the Crown had proven the allegations beyond a
    reasonable doubt: <i>R. v. Charley</i>, 2017 ONSC 605.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 25, 2018, 17 months after the trial
    judge found the respondent guilty on various charges, he entered a stay of
    proceedings, holding that the prolonged post-verdict proceedings resulted in a
    breach of the respondents right to be tried within a reasonable time under s.
    11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. The s. 11(b) claim focuses entirely on the
    post-verdict phase of the proceedings. There is no suggestion of any

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge began by accepting that s. 11(b)
    applies to post-verdict delay: <em>R. v. Charley</em>, 2018 ONSC 3551, 414
    C.R.R. (2d) 45, at paras. 2-3 (<i>Charley (application)</i>). He rejected the
    Crowns argument that the post-verdict delay should be measured exclusively
    against the criteria set out in <em>R. v. Morin</em>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771. He
    agreed with the defence contention that the post-verdict delay should be
    assessed by using the <em>Morin</em> criteria as tempered by the analysis in <em>Jordan</em>: <i>Charley (application)</i>, at paras. 6-9.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge calculated the delay from the laying
    of the charges to the verdict as 24½ months (January 15, 2015  January 27,
    2017). He then calculated the delay between conviction and the presumed date of
    sentence as 17 months (January 27, 2017  June 25, 2018). The total delay was
    41 months and 10 days. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge examined the 17-month post-verdict
    period in detail. Using concepts developed in <em>Morin</em>, he characterized
    parts of the 17 months as inherent time requirements, institutional delay,
    Crown delay, or defence delay. He held that of the 17 months, 4 months was
    attributable to the defence and 5 months was properly characterized as inherent
    time requirements, leaving 8 months, which the trial judge found could not be justified
    by the Crown. He added that 8-month post-verdict period to the 24 months pre-verdict,
    resulting in a total delay of 32 months: <i>Charley (application)</i>, at
    paras. 24-80.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge next considered the 32-month
    delay by reference to the presumptive 30-month ceiling established in <em>Jordan</em>.
    He treated the 30-month ceiling as applicable to the entire time period between
    the laying of the charge and the sentencing date. As the total delay from
    charge to sentence exceeded 30 months, it was presumptively unreasonable unless
    the Crown could demonstrate otherwise: <i>Charley (application)</i>, at para.
    80. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In considering whether the Crown had rebutted the
    presumption of unreasonable delay, the trial judge considered any prejudice
    suffered by the respondent. He determined that the respondent was significantly
    prejudiced by the delay, as he was in custody throughout: <i>Charley
    (application)</i>, at paras. 81-84. He also rejected the Crowns submission
    that the transitional exception set down in <em>Jordan</em> should apply in
    this case. The trial judge observed that the post-verdict delay, which lay at
    the heart of the s. 11(b) claim, all occurred well after <em>Jordan</em> had been
    decided: <i>Charley (application)</i>, at para. 86. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that the Crown could
    not rebut the presumption that the 32-month delay was unreasonable, compelling
    the conclusion that the respondents right to be tried within a reasonable time
    had been breached. The trial judge entered a permanent stay of proceedings. The
    Crown did not argue that there were any other remedies available under s. 24(1)
    of the <em>Charter</em> for a breach of s. 11(b).</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both the Crown and the respondent take different
    approaches on appeal to the application of s. 11(b) to post-verdict delay than they
    took at trial. The Crown acknowledges that the right to be tried within a
    reasonable time under s. 11(b) includes the right to be sentenced within a
    reasonable time: <em>R. v. MacDougall</em>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 45, at paras. 10, 19-26.
    The Crown also accepts that the <em>Morin</em> analysis no longer has any role
    to play on a s. 11(b) motion, regardless of whether one is concerned with pre-
    or post-verdict delay. As counsel put it in his factum:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span lang=EN-CA>Morin</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> is
    dead. Today the <em>Jordan</em> framework governs the assessment of sentencing
    delay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown goes on, however, to argue that the presumptive
    ceiling, a central feature of the <em>Jordan</em> framework should not be
    used in the context of post-verdict delay. The Crown contends that, not only
    should the specific presumptive ceilings set down in <em>Jordan</em> (18 months
    or 30 months) not apply to post-verdict delay, there should be no point in time
    at which post-conviction delay becomes presumptively unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that when the defence
    brings a s. 11(b) application based on post-verdict delay, the defence must
    show, first, that it took meaningful steps demonstrating a sustained effort to
    expedite the proceedings and, second, that the case took markedly longer than
    it reasonably should have. This two-prong test is the test applied in <em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> to allegations of pre-verdict delay that falls below
    the presumptive ceilings: </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at paras. 82-91. In effect, the Crown argues that
    post-verdict delay can never be presumptively unreasonable and the defence
    must, in all cases, establish the unreasonableness of the delay according to the
    criteria described in </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'> that are applicable to delay below the presumptive ceiling.</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

    that the respondent cannot show that he made a sustained effort to expedite

style='font-family:Symbol'>*</span></span></a><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'> to the constitutional claims and related motions caused
    virtually all of the delay after August 2017. Crown counsel contends that the
    record demonstrates that the defence, with the acquiescence of the trial judge,
    turned what should have been a two or three-day sentencing hearing into a
    seemingly ever-expanding inquiry into the policies and practices in remand
    centres. The inquiry came to include various federal and provincial ministries.
    The determination of an appropriate sentence for the respondent became an
    afterthought. </span></em></p>

    accepts that the right guaranteed by s. 11(b) runs to the end of the sentencing

    post-verdict delay. Counsel also agrees that post-verdict delay should be

    without a presumptive ceiling, both the need for added certainty in the
    application of s. 11(b), and the desire to shift the trial culture away from
    complacency  the two goals which drove the reformulation of the s. 11(b)
    analysis in <em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>  would be</span></em> lost. Counsel submits that the several reasons identified in <em>Jordan</em><em><span

    presumptive ceiling would be subject to the same exceptions and qualifications
    as the </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA

    7-12. The four-month delay between the verdict and the sentence was not even
    mentioned in the s. 11(b) analysis, much less taken into account in fixing the 30-month
    presumptive ceiling. Similarly, in <em>R. v. Williamson</em>, 2016 SCC 28, [2016]
    1 S.C.R. 741, a companion case to <em>Jordan</em>, total delay was calculated

    the majoritys determination of the end point for the purposes of calculating
    the relevant time period must be regarded as a carefully considered position. If
    the court had intended that post-verdict delay should be taken into account
    when determining whether the presumptive ceilings had been exceeded, the court
    would not have fixed those presumptive ceilings by reference to the date of verdict. </span></p>

    when assessing whether the case has exceeded the presumptive limits is
    significant. In many criminal cases, particularly the more serious cases, sentencing
    will, of necessity, take time, sometimes a matter of months. If, for the
    purposes of the presumptive ceilings, the constitutional clock runs through to
    sentencing, what was described in <em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:

    is expected to make assumptions about delay between verdict and sentence, the
    court must arguably entertain submissions about the nature of the sentencing proceeding
    which might be held, including the kind of evidence that the Crown might call.
    This kind of speculation leads down roads that could be significantly
    prejudicial to an accused who, at the time of the application had not been
    tried and was presumed innocent: see <em>R. v. J.M</em>., 2017 ONCJ 4, 344

    delay is assessed separately from pre-verdict delay. It is also assessed
    according to <em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> principles,
    but without any presumptive ceiling.</span></em> Instead of a presumptive
    ceiling, the onus is always on the defence to establish a breach of s. 11(b).
    To satisfy that onus, the defence must show first that it took meaningful steps
    that demonstrate a sustained effort to expedite the sentencing proceedings and,
    second, that the sentencing proceedings, despite those efforts, took markedly
    longer than they reasonably should have. This is the test used in <em>Jordan</em><em><span

    the accused in all cases to take meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained
    effort to expedite the sentencing proceedings. If an accused did not take those
    steps, nothing done or not done by the Crown or the court would result in a breach
    of s. 11(b). In other words, absent a sustained effort by the defence to move
    the matter to sentence, there could be no obligation on the Crown or the court
    to do anything to move the matter forward, regardless of the length of the
    post-verdict delay. This approach would not only reinforce the culture of
    complacency <em>Jordan</em> sought to displace, it would raise the criminal

lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown argues that the sentencing phase of
    the trial process is highly individualized and therefore not amenable to
    presumptive guidelines. No doubt, fixing an appropriate sentence is a highly
    personalized assessment. The court must decide on the fit sentence for the
    specific offender in the specific circumstances. However, while the assessment
    is highly individualized, the process is at least as standardized as the trial
    process. Indeed, I would suggest that the sentencing process is, in many ways, more
    predictable and controllable than the pre-verdict stage of the process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sentencing proceedings are almost inevitably
    much shorter than trial proceedings. This makes them easier to schedule and
    complete. They normally involve fewer and simpler evidentiary and legal issues.
    At the sentencing phase, a trial judge can be more proactive in requiring
    counsel, especially defence counsel, to make the kinds of disclosures with
    respect to issues and evidence that tend to facilitate hearings. I see nothing inherent
    in the nature of sentencing that makes a presumptive ceiling impractical or
    unworkable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown next argues that there should be no
    ceiling in respect of post-verdict delay because sentencing, properly done,
    requires time. Counsel submits that a sentence which considers all of the
    relevant factors must be preferred over a sentence that is hastily imposed to
    comply with a preordained presumptive ceiling. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is not an argument against presumptive

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown also argues that presumptive ceilings
    applicable to sentencing could not take into account those cases in which time-consuming,
    but necessary, steps must be taken to arrive at a fit sentence. The Crown
    points out that often these additional steps enure to the benefit of the
    accused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This submission assumes that the s. 11(b)
    analysis in <em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> amounts to a
    mechanical calculation based only on the application of the presumptive
    ceilings. The </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> analysis is more flexible than that. Considerations of defence waiver, defence
    delay, and exceptional circumstances may operate to render a pre-verdict delay
    that is above the presumptive ceiling acceptable in the circumstances: </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 58. Similar flexibility would be necessary
    in any presumptive ceilings applicable to the sentencing phase. For example, if
    the defence requested an adjournment to allow the accused to take certain
    rehabilitative steps before sentencing, and the length of the adjournment would
    necessarily take the proceedings beyond the presumptive ceiling, I would think
    the request for that adjournment would be treated as an implicit waiver of any
    s. 11(b) claim based on the delay flowing from that requested adjournment.</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown next submits that presumptive ceilings
    are inappropriate at the sentencing phase because the presumption of prejudice
    underlying the creation of those ceilings for the purposes of the pre-verdict
    stage does not hold true at the sentencing phase. I agree that the presumption
    of prejudice is attenuated post-verdict: see <em>MacDougall</em>, at para. 32.
    However, prejudice does not disappear. Persons awaiting sentence suffer various
    forms of prejudice ranging from the psychological distress brought on by the uncertainty
    of the sentence to be imposed to the very real physical stress of pre-sentence
    incarceration, sometimes in conditions that are worse than those experienced
    post-sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept that the nature of the post-verdict prejudice
    is different. This difference should be taken into account in fixing the
    presumptive ceilings for the sentencing phase of the process. The difference
    does not, however, justify jettisoning presumptive ceilings as part of the
    post-<em>Jordan</em> analysis of sentencing delay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the Crown submits that the nature of a
    sentencing proceeding is such that the Crown is very much in the dark as to
    what may or may not occur at sentencing. Counsel submits that it is unrealistic
    to place the responsibility on the Crown to move the sentencing proceeding forward
    when the Crown has little ability to control that process. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I take a different view of how the sentencing
    process should work post-<em>Jordan</em>. In my view, the trial judge can and
    should control that process. A trial judge can, very early in the sentencing
    process, require both sides to declare their intentions with respect to
    sentence, including identifying the issues to be raised, the evidence to be called,
    and the positions to be taken. Realistic timelines for the exchange of material
    and oral argument should be drawn. Those timelines must recognize both the
    statutory requirement to sentence as soon as practicable and the presumptive
    ceilings. The Crown and the defence have an obligation to cooperate in bringing
    the matter on for sentencing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>At sentencing, an accused is no longer
    presumed innocent. Nor, in my view, does the right to silence permit the
    defence to withhold disclosure of what it proposes to do on sentence. A trial
    judges power to control trial proceedings includes the power to require
    counsel on both sides to lay out their game plan for sentencing very early in
    the sentencing process. That game plan should include a realistic estimate as
    to how much court time will be needed to deal with sentencing. If dates are set
    based on those estimates, counsel must expect they will be required to adhere
    to them. In taking firm but fair control over the sentencing process, the trial
    judge can invoke the powerful language in <em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, to the effect that all participants in the criminal
    justice system have an obligation to work toward achieving prompt justice: </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span

    applies with equal force to post-verdict delay. In <em>Jordan</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, the court described presumptive ceilings as giving meaningful
    direction to the Crown as to the nature of its s. 11(b) obligation. Presumptive
    ceilings provide a benchmark against which the Crown can measure the progress
    of its case and anticipate potential s. 11(b) problems. A presumptive ceiling
    in respect of sentencing proceedings would serve the same guiding function: see </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 50. </span></em></span></p>

    at paras. 51-52. The same simplicity and incentives are brought to the

    consistency would dictate a common analytical approach to the measurement for

    phase. Whether the trial took place entirely in the provincial court, or passed
    through the provincial court to the Superior Court, should have no relevance to

    view, is there any connection between the quantifying of the appropriate presumptive
    ceiling for pre-verdict delay and the fixing of an appropriate ceiling for
    post-verdict delay. The time at which delay should become presumptively
    unreasonable for the purpose of sentence should not be influenced by the time taken
    to reach the verdict. In applying presumptive ceilings, I would keep the

    would treat pre- and post-verdict delay separately for the purpose of the
    presumptive ceilings, pre-verdict delay takes on a somewhat different role when
    the defence relies on post-verdict delay that is below the presumptive ceiling
    to establish a breach of s. 11(b). In that case, the court can look to the
    length of the proceedings prior to verdict as a factor in determining whether
    the defence has established unreasonable delay post-verdict. For example, the
    defence in attempting to show that the case took markedly longer than it
    reasonably should have, could argue that the post-verdict delay, although below
    the presumptive ceiling, constitutes unreasonable delay in the context of very
    significant pre-verdict delay.</span></em></p>

    fashion. In most cases, sentencing will be straightforward and will be
    completed in less than a day of court time. By exchanging information and
    positions in respect of sentence, counsel should be able to expedite the
    proceedings. In many cases, a pre-sentence report will be necessary. There may
    also be evidence from victims or character witnesses. That evidence should be quite

    justify any delay above the presumptive ceiling:<em> Jordan</em>, at para. 70.
    Defence counsel who fail in their obligation to participate in the appropriate
    management of the sentencing process may find causally related delays
    attributed to the defence or viewed as implicitly waived by the defence
    conduct.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cases in which the sentencing proceeding will
    be complex, the parties should be required very soon after the verdict to make
    the trial judge aware of the issues that will be raised on sentencing. In doing
    so, counsel must be prepared to discuss those issues and their potential
    complexities in some detail and with some precision. Vague references to
    evidence that might or might not be called in respect of undefined issues are
    not good enough and should not be accepted by the trial judge. All parties are
    responsible for developing a plan that will allow the sentencing to proceed
    expeditiously.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When a trial judge has been alerted to complex
    issues that will be raised on sentence, the trial judge should set an
    appropriate schedule with counsel to address those issues in a timely and
    efficient manner. That schedule must keep the presumptive ceiling firmly in
    mind. If it appears to the trial judge that the proposed plans of counsel could
    run up against the presumptive ceiling, the trial judge should raise that issue
    with counsel at the scheduling meeting. Counsel should be asked to specifically
    address issues such as waiver and exceptional circumstances considered in the
    context of their proposed plans with respect to sentencing. Potential s. 11(b)
    problems should be confronted and addressed before they become s. 11(b)
    violations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge is entitled to
    expect a high level of cooperation between counsel on sentencing. For example,
    the impact of pre-trial custody conditions on sentence has become a commonly
    litigated matter. Counsel should be well-aware of the kind of material that should
    be put before the trial judge in support of a claim that the sentence should be
    mitigated to reflect those pre-trial conditions. Defence counsel should be able
    to identify, with particularity, the material needed. The trial judge is
    entitled to look to the Crown to cooperate with the defence in obtaining that
    material, especially if it is in the hands of government agencies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>This case provides a good example of what
    cannot be allowed to happen in respect of sentencing proceedings that have some
    complexity. Defence counsels position that he should not be required to take
    any steps to prepare his various motions and arguments on sentencing until the
    Crowns s. 752.1 application was resolved should have been rejected. There is no
    reason why the defence could not have prepared and filed the material relating
    to the appellants pre-trial custody at the same time as the Crown was
    preparing its s. 752.1 application. Counsels suggestion that the respondents
    right to silence entitled him to simply await the resolution of the s. 752.1 application
    was untenable. Armed with a five-month presumptive ceiling and the recognition
    in <em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> that all involved have
    an obligation to move the matter forward, a trial judge could, absent a waiver
    of delay, require defence counsel to move forward immediately after verdict
    with the various issues it proposed to raise on sentencing. </span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Appropriate management of the sentencing process
    by the trial judge would also avoid the kind of rudderless, ever-expanding
    arguments brought by the defence in this case. With respect, it should have
    been obvious, very soon after the defence served its first wave of
    constitutional material in the summer of 2017, that the issues the defence
    proposed to raise went far beyond those that were relevant to determining the
    fit sentence for the respondent. The trial judge did eventually limit the scope
    of the defence motions on sentencing. He did so only after a formal motion
    brought by one of the government respondents, and some seven months after the
    defence motions had begun. By then, numerous court days had been used up, much
    of the time spent inquiring into matters that had nothing to do with the
    appropriate sentence for the respondent. Hopefully, a presumptive ceiling
    applicable to post-verdict delay will alert everyone to the need to focus on the
    issues relevant to the imposition of a fit sentence. A presumptive ceiling
    should encourage trial judges to intervene when necessary to keep sentencing
    proceedings on track.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The trial judge found the respondent guilty of
    various charges on January 27, 2017. The respondent would have been sentenced on
    June 25, 2018, had the proceedings not been stayed. For the purposes of the <em>Jordan</em> analysis, the total delay post-verdict is 17 months. After the Crowns s. 752.1
    application was dismissed in June 2017, the Crown was prepared to speak to
    sentence in early-August 2017. In oral argument, counsel for the respondent
    acknowledged that the period from August 2017 until the convictions were stayed
    in 2018 was consumed with defence constitutional applications and motions,
    which in the circumstances are properly characterized as defence delay for the
    purposes of the <em>Jordan</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> analysis. I
    fully agree with this concession. Consequently, the net delay is </span></em>seven
    months (late-January 2017  August 2017). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The net delay of seven months exceeds the
    presumptive ceiling of five months that I would hold as applicable to
    post-verdict proceedings. However, five of the seven months was occupied with
    the Crowns application under s. 752.1 for an order directing a psychiatric
    assessment of the respondent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The s. 752.1 application could only be made
    after the guilty verdicts. It required the Crown to gather a large amount of
    material from a variety of sources. The Crown began to assemble the material
    well before the verdict. Some of the material could not, however, be obtained
    until after the verdicts. In addition to assembling the material, the Crown had
    to prepare an application record, serve it, and prepare for argument. The
    defence also needed time to digest the information once it was provided by the
    Crown and prepare a response. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A s. 752.1 application is the Crowns first step
    in the bringing of a dangerous offender or long-term offender application under
    Part XXIV of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Part XXIV proceedings are, of
    necessity, taken after verdict. In my view, those proceedings are properly
    characterized as exceptional in the sense that they are reasonably
    unavoidable once the Crown has determined that the circumstances dictate that
    a Part XXIV designation should be sought: see <em>Jordan</em>, at paras. 69-72; <em>Cody</em>, at paras. 46-48. However, even when delay is attributable to a
    reasonably unavoidable circumstance or event, the Crown has an obligation to
    mitigate any resulting delay: <em>Cody</em>, at para. 48.</span></p>

    material before the verdicts. The Crowns conduct in this regard cannot,
    however, be characterized as unreasonable. The Crown acted responsibly: </span></em><em>Cody</em><em><span

    attributable to an exceptional circumstance, that is the commencement of a Part
    XXIV proceeding. In my view, the s. 752.1 application constitutes a discrete
    event in the context of that exceptional circumstance. The five months required
    to bring and resolve the s. 752.1 application should be deducted from
    post-verdict delay before applying the five-month presumptive ceiling: </span></em><em>Jordan</em><em><span

    this application had no chance of success and is properly characterized as
    frivolous. Relying on </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>Cody</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, at paras. 30-35, counsel contends that
    the time spent by the Crown in advancing a frivolous </span></em><span

    cannot rely on the time needed to make and dispose of that application as an
    exceptional circumstance. I do not, however, agree that the Crowns application
    was frivolous. The application was arguable. Indeed, it initially succeeded.
    The trial judge reconsidered and reversed his decision based on a factual error
    concerning one entry in the respondents criminal record. The trial judges
    reasons tell me that this was a close call. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the respondents argument that the application was
    frivolous rests on the assertion that because the test for granting an
    assessment order under s. 752.1 is a low one, any application that fails to
    meet that test must be frivolous. In judging merit, one looks not at the
    severity of the test for granting the relief sought, but rather at how close
    the applicant came to meeting the test. If the application is arguable on the
    test to be applied, the application cannot be branded as frivolous, regardless
    of how difficult or easy the test is to meet.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In summary, I would treat the initiation of a proceeding under Part
    XXIV of the <em>Criminal Code</em> as an exceptional circumstance. I would also
    treat the s. 752.1 application as a discrete event in that process. I would
    deduct five months from the seven-month delay: see <em>Coulter</em>, at para.
    38. The remaining two-month delay falls below the five-month presumptive
    ceiling I would set. It is also below the three-month presumptive ceiling
    suggested by the respondent.</span></p>

    the presumptive ceiling applicable to post-verdict delay set down in this case.
    There is, however, no need to consider how the transitional exception would

lang=EN-CA> and is ripe for reconsideration after <em>Jordan</em>. Crown
    counsel, however, does not suggest that this court should reconsider the <em>ratio</em> from <em>Rahey </em>in this case. Instead, counsel focuses on the appropriate
    remedy for a breach of s. 11(b) caused by post-verdict delay. He submits that
    this issue was not decided by <em>Rahey</em> and that this court is free to
    exercise the full remedial versatility of s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter</em> and
    develop a remedy that is appropriate and just in all of the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>Neither <em>Rahey</em> nor any of the subsequent cases specifically
    address the appropriate remedy for post-verdict delay. In <em>Betterman v.
    Montana</em>, 578 U.S. ___, 136 S. Ct. 1609, at p. 1615, Ginsburg J., for the
    court, described the possibility of vacating a valid conviction based on
    sentencing delay as an unjustified windfall for the accused. That seems to me
    to be an accurate description. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The analysis offered in <em>Rahey</em> to support the holding that a
    stay of proceedings was the required remedy for a s. 11(b) breach suggests that
    the remedy for a post-verdict s. 11(b) breach should target sentence and not
    conviction. In <em>Rahey</em>, at p. 614, Lamer J., for himself and Dickson
    C.J.C., two of the six-person majority, explained that a stay of proceedings
    was the only appropriate remedy for a s. 11(b) breach for jurisdictional
    reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Now to turn to the remedy. Again in <em>Mills</em>,
    I have explained why a stay is the minimal remedy. If an accused has the
    constitutional right to be tried within a reasonable time, he has the right not
    to be tried beyond that point in time, and no court has jurisdiction to try him
    or order that he be tried in violation of that right. After the passage of an
    unreasonable period of time, no trial, not even the fairest possible trial, is
    permissible. To allow a trial to proceed after such a finding would be to
    participate in a further violation of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>

    members of the <em>Rahey</em> majority, did not embrace Lamer J.s
    jurisdictional explanation for the need to impose a stay in all cases involving
    a breach of s. 11(b). They did, however, agree that a stay was the only
    appropriate remedy. For example, Wilson J. said, at p. 619:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>What the court cannot do is find that his
    right has been violated, i.e., that the reasonable time has already expired,
    and still press him on to trial. For to do so is to deprive him of his right
    under s. 11(b) in the pretext of granting him a remedy for its violation.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The language of Wilson J., like the reasons of Lamer J., justifies a

    48. The jurisprudence also recognizes that <em>Charter</em> breaches may

lang=EN-CA>In a case like this, when this court is satisfied that an order
    staying the proceedings must be set aside and the trial judge has made findings
    of guilt, it is necessary for this court to examine the reasons for those
    findings before deciding the appropriate order under s. 686(4)(b). If this
    court is satisfied that the trial judges reasons for his findings of guilt
    reveal reversible error, the court should not affirm findings of guilt based on
    those reasons. Consequently, it can neither proceed to sentence, nor remit the
    matter to the trial judge for sentencing. If the reasons on which the findings
    of guilty are based reveal reversible error, I think the only appropriate
    remedy is an order directing a new trial under s. 686(4)(b)(i). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Consequently, I would hold that the respondent is entitled to
    challenge the trial judges reasons for finding him guilty on the charges. He
    does so, not by way of a conviction appeal as it was characterized by the
    Crown, but as an argument directed at the manner in which this court should
    exercise its remedial powers under s. 686(4)(b).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the respondent submits that the trial judge made several
    errors in his analysis of the evidence. The errors include misapprehension of
    material parts of the evidence given by different witnesses and the failure to
    adequately assess the credibility of Mr. Gordon, the key Crown witness.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Mr. Campbell, with his usual skill and attention to detail, has
    carefully mustered the evidence and examined the reasons. He makes what appears,
    on its face, to be an overwhelming case against the respondent, seem less
    compelling. He does not, however, demonstrate any error by the trial judge. He
    essentially invites this court to retry the case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not propose to review each of the arguments made by counsel.
    They essentially challenge the manner in which the trial judge assessed the
    evidence. They certainly demonstrate that the trial judge could have looked at
    some of the evidence differently than he did. That is not, however, reversible
    error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Two examples of counsels submissions challenging the trial judges
    treatment of the evidence will suffice. Counsel carefully examined the physical
    evidence which the trial judge had said supported, to a significant degree, Mr.
    Gordons credibility. Counsel makes a case for viewing that evidence as less
    supportive of Mr. Gordons credibility than did the trial judge. That
    submission, however, goes to the weight assigned to the evidence, territory
    reserved to the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also relied on the evidence of Ms. Sandra Jonathan
    to a significant extent. Ms. Jonathan was in the store when the robbery
    started, fled the store, walked across the street, and called 911 while
    watching the store. The Crown relied on her evidence to refute the respondents
    evidence about his movements after the robbery started.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Counsel carefully dissected Ms. Jonathans evidence and argued that,
    on her evidence, it was possible that she did not see any of the relevant
    movements made by the respondent. He submits that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence in coming to a different assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Assuming it is possible to read Ms. Jonathans evidence in a way
    that would explain why she saw none of the respondents movements to which he
    testified, that does not mean the trial judge was obligated to take that view
    of their evidence. He took a different view, noting that it would be a rather
    large coincidence if Ms. Jonathan, while watching the store, had missed all of
    the movements described by the respondent. It was open to the trial judge to
    take that view of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is no basis upon which to interfere with the trial judges
    findings of guilt. I would not order a new trial.</span></p>

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>conclusion       </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In summary, I would extend the analysis in <em>Jordan</em> to
    post-verdict delay. Post-verdict delay should be subject to a five-month
    presumptive ceiling that would operate in the same manner, and with the same
    qualifications, as the presumptive ceilings applicable to pre-verdict delay set
    down in <em>Jordan</em>. The post-verdict delay in this case did not exceed the
    five-month presumptive ceiling. There is no suggestion that the delay, even if
    below the presumptive ceiling, was nonetheless unreasonable in the
    circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would allow the Crown appeal and set aside the permanent stay
    entered by the trial judge. The trial judge found the respondent guilty of
    armed robbery, aggravated assault, and possession of a loaded firearm: see <em>R.
    v. Charley</em>, 2017 ONSC 605, at para. 99. I would affirm the findings of
    guilt on each of those charges and remit the matter to the trial court for
    sentencing on those charges.</span></p>

    the court relied on certain American authorities in support of its position
    that s. 11(b) reached the sentencing phase. The Supreme Court of the United
    States has since held that the sixth amendment right to a speedy trial does
    not apply to the sentencing phase of the trial process: see <em><span
