    P. Belobaba of the Superior Court of Justice dated September 10, 2018, with
    reasons reported at 2018 ONSC 5151.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Miller J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Toronto City Council is a creature of
    provincial legislation. Provincial legislation governs everything from its
    composition to the scope of its jurisdiction. Shortly before the 2018 municipal
    election, the Ontario Legislature enacted legislation that changed the
    composition of the City Council, reducing it from 47 to 25 councillors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This was a substantial change, and there is no
    question that it disrupted campaigning and the candidates expectations. But
    the question before this court is not whether the legislation is good or bad
    policy, was fair or unfair; the question is whether it violates the <em>Charter</em> or is otherwise unconstitutional. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Three applications were brought challenging the
    constitutionality of the <em>Better Local Government Act</em>, <em>2018</em>,
    S.O. 2018, c. 11 (the <em>Act</em>), and seeking to restore the <em>status
    quo</em> <em>ante</em> of 47 wards in time for the October 22, 2018 election.
    The applications were successful at first instance, the application judge holding
    that the <em>Act</em> violated s. 2(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ontario appealed and brought a motion to stay (or
    suspend) the judgment pending appeal. Given the timing of the election, it was
    apparent that the stay motion would be the final word on the most significant aspect
    of the litigation  whether the October election would proceed on the basis of
    47 or 25 wards. Because of the finality of the order, the test for granting the
    stay was heavily weighted towards an assessment of the merits of the appeal.
    The most important question was whether there was a strong likelihood that the
    application judge had erred and would be reversed on appeal. A three-judge
    panel of this court concluded there was a strong likelihood that the appeal
    would succeed. Accordingly, it granted the stay and the election proceeded on
    the basis of 25 wards. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court has now had the benefit of a full
    hearing on the merits. We have not been asked to make any order concerning the
    election, which no party seeks to overturn, but simply to declare the <em>Act</em> unconstitutional. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As explained below, none of the arguments
    advanced by the City of Toronto can succeed. Although it is framed as a matter
    of protecting freedom of expression in the context of a municipal election, in
    reality the applicants complaint concerns the timing of the legislatures decision
    to change the composition of City Council  a change that is undeniably within
    the legitimate authority of the legislature. The applicants complaint has been
    clothed in the language of s. 2(b) of the <em>Charter</em> to invite judicial
    intervention in what is essentially a political matter. There is no legitimate
    basis for the court to accept this invitation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judges interpretation of s.
    2(b) of the <em>Charter</em>, guaranteeing freedom of expression, exceeded the
    bounds of legitimate interpretation and amounted to a re-authoring of that
    provision. Additional arguments raised by the City of Toronto and supporting
    interveners  drawing on unwritten constitutional principles and jurisdictional
    limits inherent in the division of powers  are similarly erroneous and
    unsupported by constitutional jurisprudence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In short, the <em>Act</em> is constitutional,
    and the appeal must be allowed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In what follows, I will address the two
    arguments from freedom of expression accepted by the application judge, before
    turning to the arguments from unwritten constitutional principles and from jurisdictional
    limits said to be inherent in s. 92(8) of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em>. First,
    however, it will be helpful to canvass the background to the litigation, and
    address a preliminary question related to the Citys standing to argue the
    appeal in this court.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> assigns to
    the legislatures of each province exclusive jurisdiction over municipal
    institutions in the province. Unlike the federal Parliament and the Legislature
    for Ontario, municipal institutions such as city councils were not established
    by the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> and have no constitutional stature. They
    exercise powers granted to them by the provincial legislatures, and the
    legislation establishing their powers and composition can be amended from time
    to time, in the same manner as any other statute.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One such legislative change occurred in 1997,
    when provincial legislation amalgamated the constituent municipalities of
    Metropolitan Toronto. That legislation organized the new City of Toronto into
    28 wards and established a Council composed of one mayor and 56 councillors,
    two councillors per ward. In 2000, Ontario enacted the <em>Fewer Municipal
    Politicians Act</em>, S.O. 1999 c. 14, which reduced the Citys wards to 22,
    aligning them with the 22 Federal Electoral Districts in existence at the time.
    However, the legislation authorized the Council to split each ward into two,
    which it did to create a total of 44 wards. This model was kept in place for the
    next five elections.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By 2014, uneven population growth in the 44
    wards resulted in some wards approaching or exceeding twice the population of
    others, undermining voter parity. The Council retained consultants to conduct a
    ward boundary review. Based on the recommendations from that review, the
    Council passed two by-laws in November 2016 to increase the number of wards
    from 44 to 47, and redraw the boundaries for all but six of the previous wards.
    Those by-laws were upheld by the Ontario Municipal Board, the administrative
    tribunal then responsible for adjudicating appeals from the Citys electoral
    boundary by-laws.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The City planned the 2018 municipal election on
    the basis of the new 47-ward model. The nomination period opened on May 1, 2018
    and closed on July 27. The election was scheduled for October 22.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 27, the closing date for nominations,
    the Government of Ontario announced that it intended to introduce legislation
    that would reduce the size of Council from 47 to 25 councillors. Three days later,
    Bill 5 was introduced into the Ontario Legislature. It proposed to redraw ward
    boundaries in line with current Federal Electoral Districts, and extended the
    nomination period to September 14.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Bill was passed and the <em>Act </em>came
    into force August 14, 2018. It provided for a municipal election based on 25
    wards, with ward boundaries identical to the existing boundaries for both federal
    and provincial elections.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The City and two groups of private individuals
    brought applications in Superior Court to challenge the constitutionality of
    the <em>Act</em>. They argued that it violated provisions of the <em>Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</em> guaranteeing freedom of expression, freedom of
    association, and equality. They also argued that it was inconsistent with the
    unwritten constitutional principles of democracy and the rule of law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge found that the <em>Act</em> breached s. 2(b) of the <em>Charter</em> in two respects. First, he concluded
    that changing the number and size of the electoral wards after campaigning had
    begun interfered with the candidates ability to campaign. The application
    judge found this to be unfair to the candidates, who found themselves in a
    suddenly altered electoral landscape. In some cases, the redrawing of ward boundaries
    meant that some of their campaigning to date  involving significant financial
    resources  had been misdirected towards voters who could not now vote for
    them. Additionally, they now needed to reach a new set of voters, who may not
    have shared the same concerns as the original target voters.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the application judge found that the <em>Act</em> limited the voters freedom of expression by increasing ward population size
    from an average of 61,000 to 111,000, effectively denying the voters right to
    cast a vote that can result in effective representation. The application judge
    held that the limits on freedom of expression he identified were not reasonable
    and could not be justified under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>. In particular,
    he found that the <em>Act</em> could not pass even the first branch of the <em>Oakes</em> test: there was no evidence that the objectives of the <em>Act</em> were
    sufficiently pressing and substantial to justify taking effect in the middle of
    an election campaign. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having found a violation of the <em>Charter</em>,
    the application judge did not proceed to consider the other arguments advanced
    by the applicants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge declared the provisions in
    the <em>Act</em> reducing the number of City wards from 47 to 25 to be of no
    force and effect. He ordered the municipal election to proceed on the basis of
    the former 47-ward model.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 19, 2019, a three-judge panel of this
    court granted a stay of the application judges order: <em>Toronto (City) v.
    Ontario (Attorney General)</em>, 2018 ONCA 761, 142 O.R. (3d) 481. The stay
    motion effectively decided the immediate controversy and the election proceeded
    on October 22 on the basis of 25 wards. Aware that granting the stay would
    determine whether the election would proceed on the basis of 47 or 25 wards,
    the court noted that greater attention must be paid to the merits of the
    constitutional claim and that it was required to determine whether there is a
    strong likelihood that the  application judge erred in law and that the
    Attorney Generals appeal to this court will succeed. The court concluded that
    the application judges reasoning was unsupportable, and that there was a
    strong likelihood that the appeal would succeed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Attorney General of Ontario appeals from the
    application judges decision. For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal. The application judge erred in determining that the <em>Act</em> infringed s. 2(b) of the <em>Charter</em>, and the constitutionality of the <em>Act</em> cannot be impugned on any other basis advanced.</span></p>

    judge or the stay panel. Neither was it raised in the Notice of Appeal. The individual
    applicants  candidates and electors  clearly had standing, and in the event
    the Citys standing appears to have been overlooked. We have not been told why the
    individual applicants have settled, but there are obvious practical realities:
    the appeal, as far as these applicants are concerned, is moot. As a result of
    the stay granted by this court, the election has taken place. No one now asks

    to interpret the Constitution, and in particular, how to interpret the
    fundamental freedoms guaranteed in s. 2 of the <em>Charter</em>. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>Principles of Charter interpretation</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To interpret the <em>Charter</em> it is
    necessary to have regard to its basic structure, and to respect the decisions that
    were made to constitutionally guarantee some, but not all, possible rights,
    using particular formulations rather than others. These constraints on constitutional
    interpretation have been emphasized by the Supreme Court since the earliest
    years of the <em>Charter</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The interpretation of the <em>Charter</em>, as
    of all constitutional documents, is constrained by the language, structure, and
    history of the constitutional text, by constitutional tradition, and by the
    history, traditions, and underlying philosophies of our society: <em>Reference
    Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.)</em>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313,
    para. 151.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court has further explained that
    understanding the scope of a <em>Charter</em> right or freedom requires an
    understanding of its purpose, which is a matter of considering the human
    interests it is intended to protect:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]his analysis is to be undertaken, and the
    purpose of the right or freedom in question is to be sought by reference to the
    character and the larger objects of the <em>Charter </em>itself, to the
    language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical
    origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and
    purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated
    within the text of the <em>Charter</em>. The interpretation should be  a
    generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of the
    guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the <em>Charter</em>'s
    protection. At the same time <span class=Underline>it is important not to
    overshoot the actual purpose of the right or freedom in question</span>, but to
    recall that the <em>Charter</em> was not enacted in a vacuum, and must
    therefore  be placed in its proper linguistic, philosophic and historical
    contexts: <em>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</em>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The text of s. 2(b) was drafted using
    intentionally vague and open-ended language, leaving much of its meaning to be shaped
    through future legislative choices and judicial decisions. But as <em>Big M</em> noted, it was enacted within particular linguistic, philosophic and historical
    contexts that provide boundaries on its construction. That is, the freedom of
    expression provision is the product of a particular context and history and is
    not so open ended as to be capable of supporting every conceivable rationale
    related to the exercise of expression. As with other <em>Charter</em> rights, and
    as the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Big M</em>, it is necessary to identify
    the actual purpose underlying this particular specification of the right, and
    not to impose others. The underlying purpose constrains and guides
    interpretation of the text of the <em>Charter</em>; it cannot be used to set the
    text aside. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge departed from the text and
    its underlying purpose and misconstrued the meaning of s. 2(b) in two ways: (1)
    extending s. 2(b) to guarantee that government action will not render anyones
    expression less effective; and (2) by subsuming a separate <em>Charter </em>right
     the right to vote (s.3)  within the freedom of expression. I will address
    each of these errors below.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>Argument 1: Legislative timing and its impact on campaign
    effectiveness</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge characterized the impact
    of the <em>Act</em> on the candidates as follows. In the interval between the
    start of the campaign on May 1 and when the <em>Act</em> took effect on August
    14, most candidates had already produced campaign materials, such as websites
    and pamphlets, that were tied specifically to the particular wards in which
    they were running, based on the old 47-ward structure. Both time and money had
    been invested in campaigning within particular wards, addressing particular
    voters with ward-specific messaging. When the wards were effectively doubled in
    size, this created challenges for the candidates: [t]here was confusion about
    where to run, how to best refashion ones political message and reorganize
    ones campaign, how to attract additional financial support, and what to do
    about all the wasted campaign literature and other material. Going forward, [t]he
    candidates efforts to convey their political message about the issues in their
    particular ward were severely frustrated and disrupted as the candidates
    spent more time on doorsteps addressing the confusing state of affairs with
    potential voters than discussing relevant political issues.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Some of the candidates communication for the
    purpose of getting elected had been directed to voters who were now in other
    wards and could no longer vote for that candidate. In other cases, time and
    energy spent earning support from voters was lost when those voters allegiance
    shifted to new candidates who would previously have run in other wards. In the
    period after Ontario had announced its intention to change the legislation, the
    complaint was that voters priorities had changed. They were said to be no
    longer as receptive to substantive political messages; they were instead
    preoccupied with understanding the impact of the <em>Act </em>and the court
    challenges to it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge concluded that the effect
    of the <em>Act</em> was to substantially interfere with the candidates
    political expression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are two related legal errors in this
    branch of the application judges analysis, as I will explain below. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the application judges analysis expanded
    the purpose of s. 2(b) from a guarantee of freedom from government interference
    with expression to a guarantee that government action would not impact the <em>effectiveness</em> of that expression in achieving its intended purpose. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the application judge conflated the
    concepts of positive and negative rights, failed to consider the framework for
    analysing a positive rights claim, and thereby impermissibly extended the scope
    s. 2(b).</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Section 2(b) does not guarantee effective expression</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The freedom to communicate with others is an
    important component of freedom of expression; it allows the dissemination of
    opinions and ideas. It is essential to any joint enterprise that requires
    individuals to coordinate their efforts with others. Section 2(b) of the <em>Charter</em> protects against government interference with most (but not all) such
    communication. But s. 2(b) protects against interference with the expressive
    activity itself, not its intended result. Put another way, freedom of expression
    does not guarantee that government action will not have the side-effect of reducing
    the likelihood of success of the projects or joint enterprises that any person
    is working to achieve. Accordingly, legislation that changes some state of
    affairs (such as the number of electoral wards), such that a persons past
    communications lose their relevance and no longer contribute to the desired project
    (election to public office), is not, on that basis, a limitation of anyones
    rights under s. 2(b): <em>Delisle v. Canada (Deputy Attorney General), </em>[1999]
    2 S.C.R. 989, at paras. 39-41; <em>Baier v. Alberta, </em>2007 SCC 31, [2007] 2
    S.C.R. 673. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Freedom of expression has an essentially
    negative orientation, an orientation that is especially important in the context
    of political expression. Freedom of expression is respected, in the main, if
    governments simply <em>refrain</em> from actions that would be an unjustified
    interference with it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Not that this requires governments to remain
    silent and passive. As Ontario argued, governments may, for example, enter the
    marketplace of ideas to offer messages that counter expression: consumer health
    warnings on various products are an obvious example. Governments may also
    respond to criticism of their policies. These responses, to the extent they are
    persuasive and effectively conveyed, may undermine the messages conveyed by others
    and diminish their intended effects. It is not part of a governments
    constitutional duty to promote, enhance, or even preserve the effectiveness of anyones
    political expression: <em>Longley v. Canada (Attorney General), </em>2007 ONCA
    852, 88 O.R. (3d) 408, at para. 110.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>Act</em>, however, did not counter
    anyones message. Rather, it altered the composition of the Toronto City
    Council, reducing the number of wards and councillors and changing electoral
    boundaries accordingly. It is clear that the legislature is free to add or
    subtract as many council seats as it considers appropriate. It can, for that
    matter, restructure the City of Toronto itself, making it bigger or breaking it
    up into smaller cities should it choose to do so. It is uncontested that it could
    do so after an election, even the very next day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>All that is in issue here is the <em>timing</em> of such legislative changes. But the alleged impact on freedom of expression itself
     as distinct from any other impact on a candidate  would be the same, regardless
    of whether the change was made during or after an election. If expression is
    wasted due to diminished campaign effectiveness when ward composition
    changes, it would be much more thoroughly wasted after campaigning is carried
    to fruition, an election took place, and Council were then restructured. All
    expressive efforts would not simply have been diminished in their effect, but would
    have been entirely for nought; after all, the purpose of campaigning is not
    just to secure election, but to govern. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Expression is one thing. Its impact is another.
    Section 2(b) does not guarantee that expression will retain its value.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Positive and negative rights</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I have noted, s. 2(b) case law emphasizes the
    negative dimension of the freedom of expression: that the purpose of s. 2(b) is
    to prevent interference by government with expression. Government is not
    required to take any positive steps to provide or maintain particular platforms
    to enable anyones expression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To the extent that a positive dimension to s.
    2(b) has been recognized by the Supreme Court, it is exceptional and narrow,
    focussing on the central case of under-inclusion: where a platform is made
    available to some, but not all. In <em>Baier</em>, the Supreme Court
    articulated a set of criteria that need to be satisfied before such an
    exceptional claim can succeed. The application judge did not, however, refer to
    this framework or the cases applying it, and instead applied the <em>Irwin Toy</em> analysis intended for negative rights claims: <em>Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec
    (Attorney General), </em>[1989] 1 S.C.R. 927. He erred in doing so. The
    appropriate framework for analysis is set out below.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>The Baier framework</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Baier </em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>at para. 30</span></em>, the Supreme Court summarized the governing framework
    for resolving a positive rights claim, which it provided in the context of a
    claim of underinclusion:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In cases where a government defending a <em>Charter</em> challenge alleges, or the <em>Charter</em> claimant concedes, that a positive
    rights claim is being made under s. 2(b), a court must proceed in the following
    way. First it must consider whether the activity for which the claimant seeks s.
    2(<em>b</em>) protection is a form of expression. If so, then second, the court
    must determine if the claimant claims a positive entitlement to government
    action, or simply the right to be free from government interference. If it is a
    positive rights claim, then third, the three <em>Dunmore </em>factors must be
    considered. As indicated above, these three factors are (1) that the claim is
    grounded in a fundamental freedom of expression rather than in access to a
    particular statutory regime; (2) that the claimant has demonstrated that
    exclusion from a statutory regime has the effect of a substantial interference
    with s. 2(<em>b</em>) freedom of expression, or has the purpose of infringing
    freedom of expression under s. 2(<em>b</em>); and (3) that the government is
    responsible for the inability to exercise the fundamental freedom. If the
    claimant cannot satisfy these criteria then the s. 2(<em>b</em>) claim will
    fail.&nbsp; If the three factors are satisfied then s. 2(<em>b</em>) has been
    infringed and the analysis will shift to s. 1.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>The following analysis applies the <em>Baier</em> framework.</span></p>
  <h6><b><span lang=EN-CA><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><span lang=EN-CA>Is the activity a form of expression? </span></h6>

The <em>Act</em> changed the composition of the Toronto City Council by reducing the number of
    wards in the City of Toronto, reducing the number of councillors, and changing the
    ward boundaries. It did so in the midst of an election. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The claimants are not required at this stage to
    establish that there has been a limitation on their freedom of expression, but
    simply that the activity for which they claim the protection of the freedom is
    a form of expression. Electoral campaigning  presenting prospective voters
    with messages intended to convince them to vote for the candidate  is
    undeniably expression for the purposes of s. 2(b): <em>Harper v. Canada
    (Attorney General), </em>2004 SCC 33, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827. The claimants

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The City argues that this is not a positive
    rights case. It argues that the candidates did not seek the creation of a new
    platform, but rather sought freedom from government interference with their use
    of an existing platform  defined as the specifically 47-ward election. In
    response to LHeureux-Dubé J.s dictum in <em>Delisle</em> that s. 2(b) does
    not compel the distribution of megaphones, the City responds that Ontario
    already provided the candidates with a megaphone  an election for a 47-member
    Council  and then smashed it. The City argues that once Ontario had provided
    an electoral platform, and the election had begun, s. 2(b) prevents Ontario
    from changing that platform.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is not a positive rights claim of the sort

    the conveyance of any message. A claim for the restoration of access to a specific
    platform is as much a positive rights claim as a demand for a new platform: <em>Baier</em>,

    paths to finding that the <em>Act</em> limited freedom of expression. Having
    found that the first path was in error, it is necessary to consider the second
    argument: that s. 2(b) is informed by the right to vote guaranteed by s. 3 of
    the <em>Charter</em>. This argument extends the protections in s. 3 that apply
    to federal and provincial elections to municipal elections. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 3 of the <em>Charter</em> guarantees
    citizens the right to vote and run for office in provincial and federal
    elections. It has been interpreted as securing for electors a right to
    effective representation: <em>Reference re Provincial Electoral Boundaries
    (Sask), </em>[1991] 2 S.C.R. 158. Section 3, on its face, has no application to
    municipal elections. The application judge, however, created a workaround by
    concluding that because <em>Charter</em> rights are interrelated, the value
    of effective representation can be used to enlarge the scope of s. 2(b) to
    guarantee that municipal voters have a right to cast a vote that results in
    effective representation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The concern from the standpoint of effective
    representation is that with wards significantly increased in size  albeit
    matching the federal and provincial electoral ridings  city councillors would be
    spread too thin and be unable to provide effective representation to constituents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The argument begins with the sound propositions
    that: expressive activity is protected by s. 2(b), voting is expressive
    activity, and voting is therefore protected expression under s. 2(b). However,
    it proceeds to the erroneous conclusion that freedom of expression guarantees
    that a vote  in whatever context  must therefore satisfy the requirements for
    meaningful and effective representation guaranteed by s. 3 for voting in
    federal and provincial elections.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This argument must be rejected. Sections 2(b)
    and 3 guarantee distinct rights that must be given independent meaning: <em>Harper</em>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rights protections often overlap in protecting a
    single activity, because persons, even in carrying out a single act, can
    simultaneously participate in multiple human goods. For example, because
    expression is often the means by which persons engage in other activities, such
    as associational activity, conscientious objection, or religious activity, a
    single act can be protected by s. 2(b) alone, or in conjunction with other
    rights such as ss. 2(a) or 2(d). <em>Baier</em> holds that where a claim can be
    advanced under more than one <em>Charter</em> right, the fact that a claim
    under one right fails does not foreclose the possibility of success under
    another right: each right must be assessed independently and given effect:
    para. 59. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But the basic structure of the <em>Charter</em> must be respected. Although the coverage of particular rights can overlap, the
    content of one right cannot be subsumed by another, or used to inflate its
    content. The application judges analysis wrongly imports the content of s. 3
    into s. 2(b) in order to circumvent the decision of the constitutional framers
    not to extend the protection of s. 3 to municipal elections.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Instead of working from the text of the <em>Charter </em>and giving effect to the constitutional settlement it established, the

    will be addressed in this section, is that unwritten constitutional principles
    provide the court with the authority to invalidate legislation on the basis
    that it is inconsistent with one or more of these principles, in the same
    manner as if there were an inconsistency with a provision of a written
    constitutional text. The second argument, which I will address in the next section,

    of Canada is partly written and partly unwritten. Constitutional texts, such as
    the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> and the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, establish
    governing institutions, allocate executive, legislative, and judicial power,
    and establish limits on the scope of those powers. The unwritten parts of the Constitution
    include conventions and usages: <em>political</em> <em>rules</em> that are
    accepted as binding on the government actors to whom they apply, but are
    enforceable only by the political branches of government and not the judiciary: <em>Reference re Secession of Quebec, </em>[1998] 2 S.C.R. 217.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The unwritten parts of the Constitution also
    include principles of political philosophy that have come to be known as
    unwritten constitutional principles. It is uncontroversial that unwritten
    constitutional principles, like all principles of political morality, can guide
    and constrain the decision-making of the executive and legislative branches of
    government: <em>British Columbia v. Imperial Tobacco, </em>2005 SCC 49, [2005]
    2 S.C.R. 473, at para. 52. But their role in adjudication by the courts is
    easily misunderstood and often overstated, because of the tendency to conflate
    legal and political unconstitutionality. There is thus significant debate both
    over the content of these principles and their relevance in adjudication: see
    for example, Mark Walters, Written Constitutions and Unwritten
    Constitutionalism and Jeffrey Goldsworthy, Unwritten Constitutional
    Principles in G. Huscroft, ed., <em>Expounding the Constitution: essays in

    any new constitutional principles. Regardless, the principles that the City
    relies on  democracy and the rule of law  are highly abstract and, in the
    language of <em>Imperial Tobacco</em>, at para. 66, amorphous. Unlike the
    rights enumerated in the <em>Charter</em>  rights whose textual formulations
    were debated, refined, and ultimately resolved by the committees and
    legislative assemblies entrusted with constitution-making authority­  the
    concepts of democracy and rule of law have no canonical formulations. These
    concepts, particularly the rule of law, are complex and multifaceted, and have sustained
    debate from Aristotles <em>Politics</em> to Aquinass <em>Summa Theologiae</em> and Lon L. Fullers <em>The</em> <em>Morality of Law</em>: (Newhaven: Yale
    University Press, 1964). As Rothstein J. emphasized, their constituent elements
    are not absolute, can only be realized to a degree, and often work at
    cross-purposes with each other: <em>Trial Lawyers Association of British
    Columbia v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</em>, 2014 SCC 59, [2014] 3 S.C.R.

    unwritten constitutional principles cannot supply judges with the relatively determinate
    guidance provided by rules set down by other institutions in advance. To use
    such indeterminate, open-ended, and contested concepts as grounds to invalidate
    legislation would be, as the Supreme Court has observed, to devolve into
    judicial governance: <em>Imperial Tobacco</em>, at para. 52-53. As La Forest
    J. wrote, [t]he ability to nullify the laws of democratically elected
    representatives derives its legitimacy from a super-legislative source: the
    text of the Constitution. He concluded that judicial review is politically
    legitimate only insofar as it involves the interpretation of an authoritative
    constitutional instrument and [t]his legitimacy is imperiled  when courts attempt
    to limit the power of legislatures without recourse to express textual
    authority: <em>Ref re Remuneration of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I.</em>;<em> Ref re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Prov. Court of P.E.I.</em>,

    92 is a source of lawmaking authority. Section 92(8) does not constitutionalize

lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Courts have sometimes used unwritten
    constitutional principles to fill gaps in the Constitution  identifying requirements
    that flow by necessary implication from the other terms of the Constitution: <em>Trial
    Lawyers Association of British Columbia v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</em>,
    2014 SCC 59, [2014] 3 S.C.R. 31, at paras. 26 and 91; <em>Reference re Senate
    Reform</em>, 2014 SCC 32, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 704, at para. 26. Such gaps are rare.
    No such gap exists here. Nor is this a case in which legislative power must be
    assigned to a new subject matter that was unknown at the time of Confederation.
    The structure of neither the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> nor the <em>Constitution
    Act, 1982</em>, creates a necessary implication that provincial lawmaking authority
    in s. 92(8) must be restricted in the manner proposed. Furthermore, this is not
    a case of constitutional framers having not addressed a social or technical
    development  like aeronautics or nuclear energy  because they simply could
    not have seen it coming. Municipal institutions, including municipal governing
    bodies, long pre-dated 1867, not only in what is now Canada, but also in the
    United Kingdom. The decision was made not to constitutionalize these institutions,
    but rather to put them under the jurisdiction of provincial legislatures.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no open question of constitutional interpretation
    here. Municipal institutions lack constitutional status. Section 3 democratic
    rights were not extended to candidates or electors with respect to municipal
    councils. These are not gaps in the Constitution  oversights or slips by the
    framers of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> and the <em>Constitution Act,
    1982</em> that can be addressed judicially. If the Constitution is to be
    amended, the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> provides the mechanism for amending
    it.</span></p>

    Section 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> protects against government interference
    with most (but not all) such communication. But s. 2(b) protects against
    interference with the expressive activity itself, not its intended result. Put
    another way, freedom of expression does not guarantee that government action
    will not have the side-effect of reducing the likelihood of success of the
    projects or joint enterprises that any person is working to achieve.
    Accordingly, legislation that changes some state of affairs (such as the number
    of electoral wards) such that a persons past communications lose their
    relevance, and no longer contribute to the desired project (election to public
    office), is not, on that basis, a limitation of anyones rights under s. 2(b)

    political expression during an active municipal election consists of far more
    than the pursuit or casting of a ballot on voting day: <i>Haig</i> at pp.

    on campaigning, including developing, printing and distributing campaign
    literature. The evidence on the record is that many candidates proceeded to do
    so. The deliberative engagement of candidates, volunteers, voters, financial

    from 47 to 25. Three days later, on July 30, the Government introduced the <i>Act</i> in the legislature. Upon being passed and proclaimed into force on August 14,
    the <i>Act</i> reconfigured the city into 25 wards, in most cases doubling both
    their physical size and the number of potential voters. It also required the
    2018 election to proceed on a 25-ward basis, cutting the number of available

    ward structure in the middle of the election, the <i>Act </i>undermined
    expressive freedom in several ways. First, it diminished the value of all past
    expression that had been framed around a 47-ward election already underway.
    Candidates could no longer run in the wards where they had already spent
    considerable time, money and energy campaigning, which demoralized many and
    caused at least some to drop out of the race entirely. Second, the timing of
    the changes caused widespread confusion and uncertainty. It deflected attention
    away from important civic issues, triggered a flurry of foreseeable legal
    challenges, and jeopardized the viability of administering the election on schedule.
    Third, the <i>Act</i> restricted candidates, volunteers, voters, donors and
    commentators from continuing to express themselves within the established terms
    of an election then in progress. In my view, this effect in particular amounted
    to an infringement of s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter;</i> it substantially
    interfered with the right of all electoral participants to freely express
    themselves within the terms of the election after it had begun.</span></p>

    is for non-interference in an election that had already begun. Accordingly, my
    conclusion that the <em>Act</em> infringed s. 2(b) turns on the timing of the

    Ontario was entitled to change the ward structure of municipal governments in

    no reason for Ontario to do this (1) for the City of Toronto only, (2) without
    any consultation as explicitly mandated by the <i>COTA </i>and the <i>TOCCA</i>,
