  <p class=Judge><span lang=EN-CA>Feldman J.A.:</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issues before the court arise out of a
    financial dispute among adult siblings over the entitlement to part of an
    interest in a very valuable investment that was made by their father in the
    1960’s. The investment was a 10% interest in a large future residential
    development in Oakville, Ontario. The balance is owned by affiliates of Mattamy
    Homes (collectively “Mattamy Homes”). The investment was always held by the
    mother in trust for the three siblings, in equal shares. This reflected her
    clear and uncontested intention to benefit her three children equally. In
    recent years, the daughter, who lives in the United States, disclaimed her
    interest in the investment, for tax reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When distributions began to be made by Mattamy
    Homes in 2014, they were paid to the mother and deposited into two bank
    accounts opened for her. By that time, one of the brothers had sold his share
    to Mattamy. The other brother claimed that he had already received his one-third
    share of the investment from the mother some years earlier. The sister claimed
    that the mother had made an oral gift to her of the distributions from the one-third
    portion of the investment that reverted to the mother following the sister’s
    disclaimer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was not disputed that half the funds in the
    bank accounts belonged, beneficially, to the brother who had not sold his
    interest. The central issue on the appeal is whether the other half of the
    funds in the bank accounts belonged beneficially to the mother or to the
    sister. For the reasons that follow, I would hold that those funds were held by
    Eda Rubner, the mother, as bare trustee for the benefit of the sister, Brenda
    Bistricer.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Marvin Rubner, Joseph Rubner, and Brenda
    Bistricer are siblings. Their mother, Eda Rubner, is over 90 years old and was found
    to lack capacity to manage her property around November 2016. Marvin and Joseph
    Rubner hold powers of attorney for property for Eda Rubner, and have been
    managing her property since August 2016. Joseph lives with and cares for his
    mother.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Karl Rubner, Eda Rubner’s late husband and the
    children’s late father, purchased a 10% interest in the Lower Fourth Joint
    Venture (the “Joint Venture”) in 1969. The Joint Venture owned land in Oakville
    that has become very valuable over time. Mattamy Homes currently owns the
    remaining 90% interest in the Joint Venture, plus a further 3.33% that Marvin
    Rubner sold to it in 2013.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Eda Rubner was always the legal owner of the
    Rubner family’s Joint Venture interest, although it was initially purchased in
    the name of Eda Rubner Realty Limited, a company that never existed. Eda and
    Karl Rubner intended each of their children to have and enjoy a one-third share
    of the Joint Venture interest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1972, Eda Rubner wrote a letter to the
    manager of the Joint Venture (the “1972 letter”). Though the parties could not
    confirm whether that letter was sent to the manager in 1972 (or ever), Marvin
    Rubner sent a copy of the letter to an accountant at Mattamy Homes in 2003. Karl
    Rubner was still alive at that time. In the letter, Eda Rubner stated “I would
    like to inform you that the one tenth that is in Eda Rubner Realty’s name in
    the above mentioned venture is being held in trust for her three children,
    one-third for Brenda Rubner, one-third for Marvin Rubner, one-third for Joseph
    Rubner.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Brenda Bistricer and her husband Alex Bistricer
    reside in the United States. After receiving tax advice, Brenda Bistricer disclaimed
    her entitlement to the one-third of the Joint Venture interest that her parents
    intended she have. The trial judge found that by 2014, she had disclaimed her
    interest. All family members agree that it is Eda Rubner who therefore owns
    that one-third of the Joint Venture interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Up to 2009, Eda Rubner paid the cash calls from
    Mattamy on the entire Joint Venture interest. However, beginning in 2009, each
    sibling paid one-third of the cash calls on the Joint Venture. Marvin and
    Joseph Rubner gave evidence that they paid the cash calls on their shares because
    they understood themselves to be beneficial owners of their respective thirds
    of the interest. Brenda Bistricer gave evidence to the effect that she paid the
    cash calls on the other one-third on the understanding that she was acting on
    behalf of Eda Rubner, who she said was no longer comfortable making such large
    payments at her age. Brenda Bistricer was comfortable with the arrangement
    because she believed that she would eventually inherit the one-third interest
    and be gifted any proceeds of income distributions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Brenda Bistricer gave evidence that there was a
    family meeting in 2012 or 2013 when Marvin Rubner raised the issue of selling
    the Lower Fourth investment to Mattamy Homes. By that time, both Marvin and
    Joseph had each asserted their ownership of one third of the investment. Brenda
    had disclaimed hers. Eda Rubner suggested that she would sell Marvin’s one
    third, pay the tax and give him the proceeds, but he wanted his one third in
    his name. At that time, Eda Rubner said that with respect to Brenda’s share in
    the investment, which Brenda had disclaimed for tax reasons, Eda would gift to
    Brenda all future distributions, tax paid. Joseph Rubner’s evidence was that
    there was a meeting where someone brought up the idea that Eda Rubner could
    declare the income from distributions and gift the proceeds but he could not
    remember any other details. Marvin Rubner denied that there was ever an
    intention to bequeath Brenda’s interest or gift the distributions to her. There
    is no written record of what occurred at the family meeting.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following that meeting, in 2013, Marvin Rubner’s
    interest was formally transferred to him by Eda Rubner and he then sold his
    interest to Mattamy Homes for $3 million.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Eda Rubner executed a new will in 2014, at a
    second meeting with a lawyer, Joseph Rubner, and Brenda and Alex Bistricer. The
    application judge stated that “it is clear from email correspondence that
    between the two meetings the structure and contents of the new will were
    dictated by Joseph Rubner and the Bistricers without reference to Eda Rubner”:
    at para. 82. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her previous 2003 will, the three children
    were named as residuary beneficiaries of Eda Rubner’s estate in equal shares.
    Marvin Rubner and two neutral non-relatives were named as executors. In the
    March 2014 will, the three siblings were named as estate trustees. At that time
    they were already engaged in litigation over the siblings’ respective shares in
    another family investment. Joseph Rubner stated in his cross-examination that
    he instructed the lawyer to add himself and Brenda Bistricer as estate trustees
    so that they could outvote Marvin Rubner in the event of disagreement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The new will contained a clause stating that Eda
    Rubner held legal and beneficial title to the one-third interest that was
    previously held in trust for Brenda Bistricer. It instructed the trustees to
    transfer Eda Rubner’s “interest in or proceeds from” the Joint Venture to
    Brenda Bistricer: see <em>Rubner v. Bistricer</em>, 2018 ONSC 1934, 36 E.T.R.
    (4th) 79, at para. 85. Further, the clause stated that Joseph Rubner had
    previously received his one-third interest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The lawyer later prepared primary and secondary
    wills to replace the March 2014 will, and they were executed by Eda Rubner in
    September 2014. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In December 2014, the Joint Venture began making
    income distributions, with cheques payable to Eda Rubner Realty. The first distribution
    was in the amount of $1,830,202.68 in December 2014 and the second was $1,200,006.00
    in February 2015. As Eda Rubner Realty did not exist, steps were taken by
    Joseph Rubner and the Bistricers to register that business name for Eda Rubner,
    then two bank accounts were opened to receive the distributions – one Canadian
    dollar account and one US dollar account. Joseph took his mother to open the
    Canadian dollar account, and Brenda and Alex Bistricer took her to open the US dollar
    account. Joseph Rubner declared half of the proceeds as income. The other half
    was declared by Eda Rubner and the tax was paid out of the bank account. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> It was understood by all parties that half of
    the monies deposited into the accounts were for Joseph Rubner and half were for
    Brenda Bistricer. The legal basis for that understanding became the subject of
    this action and appeal. In his affidavit, Joseph Rubner explained that he
    believed he could direct his mother to make payments out of the account for him
    “as a result of [his] ownership of 1/3 of the Lower Fourth Joint Venture.” He
    believed Brenda Bistricer could direct their mother regarding her half because
    of the 1972 trust.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Eda Rubner signed a number of blank cheques for
    the two accounts. Those cheques were filled in by Joseph Rubner to pay amounts
    for himself and for Brenda Bistricer. They were also filled in by Alex and
    Brenda Bistricer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For example, Joseph Rubner invested in a project
    operated by Alex Bistricer in Maryland. On September 2, 2015, he took his
    mother to the bank to wire $1,000,000 (USD) on his behalf to the US law firm
    acting on the project and $500,000 (USD) on Brenda Bistricer’s behalf. Then in
    November, 2015 Alex Bistricer told Joseph Rubner, and he agreed, that he wanted
    Joseph Rubner and Brenda Bistricer to have equal investments in the project. As
    a result, Alex Bistricer filled in one of the blank cheques from the US account

    She would ask him to make out a cheque and have Eda Rubner sign it when she
    wanted to use the funds to pay her Canadian expenses. Joseph Rubner stated that
    in June 2015, Alex Bistricer asked to hold the cheque books for both accounts so
    that he could pay an accountant for the preparation of Eda Rubner’s 2014 tax
    returns. The cheques had been signed in blank by Eda Rubner on request of

    filled in by Alex Bistricer in December 2016 to pay out the balances in the two

    clear that Eda Rubner intended to hold undivided one-third interests in the family’s
    10% Joint Venture investment in trust for each child: at para. 115. Eda
    Rubner’s declaration of trust was sufficient to constitute the trust – because
    she was both the settlor and trustee, she did not have to send the letter: at
    paras. 117-18. Because the 1972 letter contained no powers of revocation, the settlor,
    Eda Rubner, did not have the power to revoke or alter the declared terms of the
    trust: at para. 126. Brenda Bistricer therefore retained her beneficial

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span

lang=EN-CA>There was “no evidence supporting any doubt that Eda Rubner always

    were wired and paid to her by cheque prior to November 2016]”: at para. 39. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span

lang=EN-CA>There is “no doubting that Eda Rubner always intended the final
    one-third interest to belong to Brenda Bistricer. It is only Brenda Bistricer’s
    disclaimer and renunciation that is impairing the fulfilment of Eda Rubner’s
    intention that Brenda Bistricer own the capital interest and the income that it
    generates”: at para. 161.<span style='background:white'> </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the application judge rejected Brenda
    Bistricer’s claim to the funds in the accounts based on a gift by her mother of
    all future distributions from the Joint Venture. He held that Eda Rubner’s
    alleged gift of all future income distributions could not succeed in law, and that
    the giving or taking of signed blank cheques did not, without more, amount to a
    valid gift: at paras. 40, 147-48, 154-56. Because an effective gift requires
    delivery, a promise to give a gift in future is not an effective gift and is
    not binding. Furthermore, cheques are not effective gifts until cashed; at the
    time a cheque is cashed, the donor account holder must still intend the funds
    to be gifted: at para. 177. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the two cheques that the
    Bistricers made out and cashed in December, 2016, the application judge found
    that on December 22, 2016, Eda Rubner did not have capacity to direct her bank
    to give the funds in the two accounts to Brenda Bistricer. He concluded on that
    basis that Brenda Bistricer was not entitled to the funds that Alex Bistricer
    had withdrawn from the two accounts in December 2016, and that she was not
    entitled to any future income distributions paid on the one-third interest that
    she had disclaimed or renounced.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge also concluded that Brenda
    Bistricer could not rely on the doctrine of equitable estoppel to ground a
    right to the income distributions. Brenda Bistricer argued that Eda Rubner was
    estopped from denying the one-time gift of all future income because she
    (Brenda Bistricer) relied on the gift in making withdrawals to pay expenses.
    The application judge determined there was no evidence to support an estoppel
    against Eda Rubner because Brenda Bistricer was “entitled to use funds actually
    given to her as each cheque was cashed or each wire sent”: at para. 158. Her
    use of funds was therefore “not unequivocally referable to there being a
    one-time promise that future distributions would belong to her even if she were
    to disclaim her interest in the interim”: at para 158.</span></p>

    Bistricer’s argument that the 2014 wills could be relied upon to corroborate Eda
    Rubner’s intention to bequeath the remaining one-third interest and to gift to
    her the income distributions referable to that interest. Because he concluded
    that the contents of the will were dictated by Joseph Rubner and the Bistricers,
    the application judge was not prepared to rely on them as representing independent
    evidence of corroboration of Eda Rubner’s intent: at para. 168. </span></p>

    originally held the beneficial interest in a one-third share in the Joint
    Venture interest, the same as her two brothers. But, apparently for tax reasons,
    she disclaimed that interest. Throughout these proceedings, she took the
    position that she did not have any proprietary interest in the Joint Venture,
    the trial judge so held, and there has been no appeal from that holding.
    However, she never took the position that she had disclaimed any amounts that
    would come to her from her mother after her disclaimed interest resulted back to
    her mother. It is those distributions that she claimed were hers, as a gift
    from her mother. Brenda Bistricer’s main position on the application was that
    having disclaimed entitlement to the one-third interest in the Joint Venture
    that was designated and held in trust for her by her mother, and that interest
    having become her mother’s beneficially, her mother then told her that she
    would give her the distributions on what had been her interest, after paying
    the tax on them, and that she would leave her interest to Brenda Bistricer in
    her will. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>And that is exactly what happened: the
    distributions were deposited into the Eda Rubner Realty bank accounts that
    Joseph Rubner and Brenda Bistricer opened with their mother for that purpose;
    Eda Rubner paid the tax on Brenda Bistricer’s half, while Joseph Rubner paid
    the tax on his half; Eda Rubner signed blank cheques to be filled in to make
    any payments requested by Joseph Rubner or Brenda Bistricer out of their
    respective halves; and Eda Rubner executed a new will which stated that Joseph
    Rubner had received his share of the Joint Venture investment and that Eda
    Rubner bequeathed her interest in the Joint Venture to her daughter, Brenda
    Bistricer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, Brenda Bistricer’s claim to one half of
    the contents of the bank accounts and to future distributions based on an oral
    gift from her mother could not succeed in law, and the trial judge so held.
    Unfortunately, regardless of intention, a promise to give a future gift does
    not create an effective gift at law. An effective gift requires delivery. While
    delivery does not have to be co-incident with the statement of intent to give,
    it must occur to make the gift complete: Bruce Ziff, <em>Principles of Property
    Law</em>, 6th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2014), at pp.15960-62;<i> <em>Teixeira v.

    incapable of handling her own affairs, she could no longer complete a gift. The
    application judge concluded that the cheques that were cashed and cleared
    before Eda Rubner was found to be incapable were valid “one-off” gifts. But,
    Brenda Bistricer was not entitled to the future distributions on the basis of
    the gift theory advanced by counsel for the appellants on the application. However,
    this does not preclude the possibility of a bare trust over the contents of the
    bank accounts. Indeed, although no substantive argument ensued, the application
    judge noted that he raised this issue with counsel at the hearing.</span></p>

    English Court of Appeal did not require the settlor to have used “stilted

    L.J., for the court, determined that the court must instead consider what was “said

    exists as soon as the declaration occurs, since the settlor/trustee has parted
    with equitable title to the property in favour of the beneficiary: at p. 255;
    Waters, at pp. 184-85. It is important to reiterate that equity focuses on
    substance – the settlor does not have to speak or think in the terms of a trust:
    Oosterhoff, at p. 257. Where a person intends to transfer the beneficial

    the conclusion that each cheque that Eda Rubner wrote and that Brenda Bistricer
    cashed before Eda Rubner was declared incapable was a completed gift. This

    on Mattamy Homes’s books (Marvin Rubner having sold his 3.33% share to Mattamy
    Homes in 2013), the distributions were paid to Eda Rubner Realty. That
    necessitated obtaining a registered business name for Eda Rubner in order to
    open the accounts and deposit the cheques. Brenda Bistricer lived in the United

    Rubner also transferred to Joseph Rubner his one third interest, although the
    documentation for that transfer was not produced in the record. The fact that
    it occurred was recited in the March 10, 2014 will of Eda Rubner, for which
    Joseph Rubner gave instructions. Joseph Rubner also testified that because he
    had received his one-third interest from Eda Rubner before the first
    distribution came from Mattamy Homes, he took his half of the amount received

    and also by Alex Bistricer when he had the cheque books, for expenses as
    directed by Brenda Bistricer and by Joseph Rubner. There is no suggestion in
    the evidence that Eda Rubner ever personally spent any of the money in the

    members contains many inconsistencies and informalities. Before 2009, there
    were a number of cash calls made by Mattamy Homes which were paid by Eda Rubner
    even though she held the investment as bare trustee. The original trust
    document was a 1972 letter, possibly never delivered, and found years later in
    a file. Brenda Bistricer’s disclaimer of her interest was not done in a
    documented, formal manner, but by oral statements made on a number of
    occasions. Because it was always understood by everyone that the Joint Venture

    Bistricer effectively took it upon himself to act as a trustee and to possess
    and administer trust property, but he did not commit a breach of trust in so
    doing because he did not act inconsistently with the terms of the trust: <em>Air
    Canada v. M&amp;L Travel Ltd.</em>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 787, at pp. 808-09; <em>Royal
    Bank v. Fogler</em><i> </i>(1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 734 (C.A.), at p. 743. The
    purpose of the bare trust over the accounts was for Eda Rubner to hold the
    funds until Brenda Bistricer and Joseph Rubner wanted them transferred into
    their possession. Alex Bistricer’s act of filling out the pre-signed cheques in
    favour of Brenda Bistricer and depositing the funds into Brenda Bistricer’s
    account fulfilled the terms of the trust.</span></p>

    dealt with the trust property in breach of trust, Brenda Bistricer acquiesced
    to the manner in which he dealt with the property to which she was beneficially
    entitled: see <em>Fogler</em>, at pp. 743-46; Waters, at pp. 1302-06. There is
    no issue that Brenda Bistricer knew and approved of Alex Bistricer’s actions,
    given her view that the funds already belonged to her: see <em>Rubner</em>, at
    para. 178.</span></p>

    be a constructive trust over the funds in favour of Brenda Bistricer: Oosterhoff,

lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s finding of conversion
    also cannot stand, as Alex Bistricer’s actions do not meet the test for
    conversion as set out in <i>373409 <em>Alberta Ltd. (Receiver of) v. Bank of
    Montreal</em></i>, 2002 SCC 81, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 312, at paras. 8-10. The tort
    of conversion “involves a wrongful interference with the goods of another, such
    as taking, using or destroying these goods in a manner inconsistent with the
    owner’s right of possession”: at para. 8. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because Alex Bistricer dealt with the funds in a
    manner that was consistent both with the purpose of the trust and with Brenda
    Bistricer’s beneficial interest in the trust property, and because the taking
    of the funds was done “in concert with Brenda Bistricer”, it is difficult to
    see his actions as a wrongful taking: <em>Rubner</em>, at para. 178. In the end
    result, Brenda Bistricer is entitled to the funds.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore set aside the finding of liability

  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-CA>Issue #2: Does Eda Rubner also hold one half of the future
    distributions from the Joint Venture as bare trustee for Brenda Bistricer?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This question must be answered in the negative.
    As discussed above, future property cannot be the subject matter of a trust. While
    a trust could legally have been declared by Eda Rubner over any chose in action
    she may have held to future distributions from Mattamy Homes, she did not do
    so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The actions of the parties that establish the
    three certainties of a trust over the distributions that were deposited into the
    bank accounts do not relate to any amounts not yet deposited. Primarily, there
    is no action that relates to an intention to create a trust over any funds not
    yet deposited or over Eda Rubner’s interest in the Joint Venture. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-CA>Issue #3: Are the appellants entitled to advance the bare trust
    argument on appeal?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents submit that the appellants are
    precluded from arguing on appeal that there was no “gift” of the future
    distributions, but rather the contents of the bank accounts were held by Eda
    Rubner as bare trustee, 50% each for the benefit of Brenda Bistricer and Joseph
    Rubner. They submit that this argument was not advanced before the application
    judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Counsel for the respondents also submits that
    had he known there were two potential trusts being alleged, one over the bank
    accounts, he would have cross-examined Brenda Bistricer about her statements
    that she had no beneficial interest in the Joint Venture.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> I am satisfied that the respondents suffered no
    prejudice on this account. Counsel asked Ms. Bistricer regarding her disclaimer
    of any interest in the Joint Venture many times during the cross-examination
    and her position was clear. Her position was that she was not disclaiming the
    distributions from the Joint Venture that were deposited into the Eda Rubner
    Realty bank accounts and tax paid. Indeed, on at least one occasion, counsel
    for Brenda Bistricer interjected to clarify her objection to certain questions
    being put to Brenda by counsel for the intervenors which conflated the asset
    (the Joint Venture interest) and the income (the distributions).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would reject the respondent’s objection to
    considering the trust issue on the appeal for the following reasons. When the
    relief sought and grounds listed in both the Application for advice and
    directions commenced by Joseph and Marvin Rubner and the Application commenced
    by Brenda Bistricer are considered together, it is clear that the ownership of
    the monies in the two bank accounts is in issue. The brothers relied on both
    rule 14.05 (3)(a)-(d) and s. 60 of the <em>Trustee Act</em> in support of their
    request for advice and directions. In <em>Hunter Estate v. Holton</em> (1992),
    7 O.R. (3d) 372 (Gen. Div.) the applicants relied on these provisions in
    seeking advice and directions as to whether it was lawful for the executors and
    trustee to transfer assets to two newly created trusts. Steele J. noted, at p. 376,
    that in a proper case the court should not limit its opinion narrowly when all
    of the issues are before it. Similarly, in this case, the court should not
    limit its advice and directions to the gift issue when the larger question of
    whether the funds in the bank accounts were the property of Brenda Bistricer is
    before the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, although no substantive argument was
    made, the application judge was obviously alive to the trust issue and
    expressly asked “whether Eda Rubner’s statements might have amounted to an oral
    declaration by Eda Rubner that she holds income distributions after tax in
    trust for Brenda Bistricer”: at para. 150.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the facts and circumstances of what
    occurred are clear in the evidentiary record. It is only the legal characterization
    that is in issue. As this court stated in <em>Kaiman v. Graham</em>, 2009 ONCA
    77, 45 E.T.R. (3d) 163, at para. 18:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The general rule is that appellate courts will
    not entertain entirely new issues on appeal. The rationale for the rule is that
    it is unfair to spring a new argument upon a party at the hearing of an appeal
    in circumstances in which evidence might have been led at trial if it had been
    known that the matter would be an issue on appeal: 767269 Ontario Ltd. v.
    Ontario Energy Savings L.P., 2008 ONCA 350 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 3. The burden
    is on the appellant to persuade the appellate court that &quot;all the facts
    necessary to address the point are before the court as fully as if the issue
    had been raised at trial&quot;: Ross v. Ross (1999), 181 N.S.R. (2d) 22 (N.S.
    C.A.), at para. 34, per Cromwell J.A.; Ontario Energy Savings L.P. at para. 3.
    This burden may be more easily discharged where the issue sought to be raised
    involves a question of pure law: see e.g. R. v. Vidulich (1989), 37 B.C.L.R.
    (2d) 391 (B.C. C.A.); R. v. Brown, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918 (S.C.C.), per
    L'Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting. In the end, however, the decision of whether to
    grant leave to allow a new argument is a discretionary decision to be guided by
    the balancing of the interests of justice as they affect all parties: R. v.
    Warsing, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579 (S.C.C.), per L'Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting; R. v.
    S. (K.) (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.); Vidulich at pp. 398-99. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>See also <em>National Money Mart
    Company v. 24 Gold Group Ltd.</em>, 2018 ONCA 812, at paras. 37-41. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, the general rule is not engaged. The
    entire history of the Joint Venture investment shows that the family acted in a
    consistently informal manner with respect to its ownership. As non-lawyers,
    their characterization of the legal relationship was also informal and
    imprecise. As the application judge perceived, it was possible that the
    circumstances amounted to a bare trust in law. Indeed, he appears to have been
    satisfied that the evidentiary record was sufficient to address the issue
    himself, on submissions by counsel: see para. 150. I am satisfied that this
    court is well-placed, based on the evidentiary record before it, to respond to
    the request for advice and directions and to determine the correct legal
    characterization of Brenda Bistricer’s interest, if any, in the Joint Venture
    distributions attributable to her original one-third interest. It is therefore
    in the interests of justice to address it now on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-CA>Issue #4: Is it appropriate or necessary for the court to make any
    order regarding any findings made by the application judge in respect of the
    2014 will? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants submit that the application judge
    erred in making certain findings regarding the 2014 will based on the paper
    record before him on the application in the face of significant evidence that
    conflicted with his findings. In particular, counsel referred to paras. 86,
    168, 171 and 172 of the reasons. The practical concern that counsel raised is
    that those findings may be treated as <em>res judicata</em> in any future litigation
    that may be brought seeking to challenge or uphold the will. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the appellants, that the
    application judge was not deciding whether the 2014 wills should be admitted to
    probate. He was only considering whether the wills could amount to corroboration
    of Eda Rubner’s intent to gift to Brenda her one-third of the Joint Venture
    investment. He found that he was not prepared to treat the wills as
    corroborative of Eda Rubner’s independent intent. see para. 173. In the context
    of the gift issue that was before him on the application, he was entitled to make
    that determination.</span></p>

    substantial indemnity costs in the amount of $180,000.00 in favour of Joseph

    Brenda and Alex Bistricer, and partial indemnity costs in the amount of

lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons, the application judge accepted
    the respondents’ submission that the appellants engaged in litigation
    misconduct that warranted an elevated costs award. He awarded costs in favour
    of the litigation guardian on two bases: first, because he had successfully
    asserted Eda Rubner’s position and therefore Eda Rubner was entitled to recover
    costs from Brenda Bistricer, and second, because Brenda was unsuccessful in
    asking the litigation guardian to return funds paid to him by the attorneys for
    property out of the disputed bank accounts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I would allow the appeal in part with respect
    to the funds in the bank accounts, the mix of success has now changed. There
    will be no judgment against Alex Bistricer; the trustees for property will

    Brenda and Alex Bistricer do not have to pay the funds removed in December 2016
    to Eda Rubner.</span></p>
