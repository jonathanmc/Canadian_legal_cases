    reported at 2016 ONSC 3219.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>We dismissed the
    appellant’s appeal of his conviction for aggravated assault with reasons to
    follow. These are the reasons.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The appellant was at a
    bar with friends on the evening of March 27, 2015. He was wearing his work vest,
    which contained a five-inch folding knife that he used for his job at a glass
    factory. After the group left the bar, they encountered the complainant and his
    friends on the street. The complainant, most of his friends, and the
    appellant’s friends had been drinking that night. The complainant testified
    that he was “blackout drunk” and had no memory of the incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>An argument broke out
    between the two groups. According to the appellant, the complainant punched
    him, his glasses went flying, and he felt woozy. He pulled out his knife and
    waved it, telling the complainant to “get away.” The complainant was not
    intimidated. The appellant testified the complainant’s friends held the
    complainant back and the appellant ran away down the street, unaware the
    complainant had been cut. The complainant broke free, pursued the appellant,
    and the fight continued. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>No one witnessed the
    second stage of the fight. The appellant said he stopped and saw the
    complainant coming after him. The complainant punched the appellant again and
    tried to take the knife from him. The appellant said he waved the knife to
    create space between himself and the complainant. He said he ran and jumped
    into a taxi. He did not think the complainant was hurt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In fact, the
    complainant was seriously injured from 13 stab wounds. The appellant sustained
    minor injuries. An independent witness said she saw the complainant bloodied on
    the sidewalk after the fight, holding his wounds and yelling, “[w]hy’d you do
    that?” She said the appellant walked away from the complainant at a normal pace
    and looked back. She and her friend then took the complainant to a restaurant
    and asked staff to call 911. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The appellant was tried
    on one charge of possession of a weapon for a  purpose dangerous to the public
    peace, contrary to s. 88(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, and one charge of aggravated assault
    under s. 268(1). The trial judge granted a directed verdict of acquittal on the
    first charge. The jury convicted the appellant of aggravated assault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>At trial, the appellant
    claimed he had acted in self-defence. The Crown conceded that the complainant
    was likely the initial aggressor in the fight. The issue was whether the appellant
    had used more force than reasonably necessary.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Appellant’s Arguments</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The appellant advanced
    three arguments on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>First, the appellant contended
    that the trial judge erred by refusing his application under </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Scopelliti</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:
normal'> (1982), 34 O.R. (2d) 524,</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>to
    call a witness who, on an earlier occasion, had been attacked by the
    complainant. The trial judge also limited the appellant’s cross-examination of
    the complainant on why he entered a peace bond after being charged with assault
    on that earlier occasion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Second, the appellant submitted
    that the trial judge erred in dismissing his application to exclude his own
    criminal record pursuant to </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Corbett</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670</span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:
200%'>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Third, the appellant
    argued that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that the directed
    verdict on the weapon dangerous charge was an acquittal. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dismissal of the Appellant’s <i>Scopelliti</i> Application and Restriction of the Cross-Examination of the Complainant</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The complainant had
    been charged in 2011, about four years before the offences charged, for a drunken
    assault of the manager of a sports bar. The charges were withdrawn when the
    complainant entered a peace bond. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In cross-examination,
    the complainant acknowledged the incident occurred but claimed he was too drunk
    to remember what happened. The trial judge limited the appellant’s
    cross-examination of the complainant as to why he had entered a peace bond. The
    appellant brought a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Scopelliti</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> application to call the victim of the
    complainant’s previous attack to testify that the complainant had aggressively
    attacked him while drunk. The trial judge dismissed the application with brief reasons
    and did not reconsider her decision following the appellant’s unsuccessful </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Corbett</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submitted
    that the complainant’s history of aggressive behaviour while highly intoxicated
    was relevant to his (the appellant’s) defence of self-defence. The evidence </span><span
lang=EN-CA>tended to support the appellant's claim that the complainant was the
    aggressor and thus the appellant's response was in self-defence.</span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>We were not persuaded
    by this argument. At trial, it was not disputed that the complainant was the
    aggressor, both in the initial altercation and following his chase of the
    appellant. Evidence that the complainant became aggressive when drunk on
    another occasion was unnecessary. As well, the probative value of the proposed
    evidence was minimal: it involved an incident in 2011, when the complainant was
    19 years old.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In the context of this
    trial, the trial judge did not need to provide detailed reasons for her ruling
    on the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Scopelliti</span></em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'> application. The ruling had a clear basis in the
    record and the issues were straightforward.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Moreover, much of the
    proposed evidence was already before the jury. In cross-examination, the
    complainant stated that the last time he got “blackout drunk,” he was arrested
    for punching a man at a bar, referring to the 2011 incident. Although the trial
    judge precluded further questioning about this incident and denied the
    appellant’s </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Scopelliti</span></em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'> application, the details of the peace bond were before
    the jury in an agreed statement of fact. The record provided defence counsel
    with the basis to argue, as he did, that the jury should find that the
    complainant tended to become violent when drunk.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

    the trial judge ought to have revisited her </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Scopelliti</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>ruling after denying the appellant’s </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Corbett</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> application. We reject this submission. The evidence of the complainant’s past
    conduct did not become relevant simply because the trial judge admitted
    evidence of the appellant’s past criminal conduct.</span></p>
