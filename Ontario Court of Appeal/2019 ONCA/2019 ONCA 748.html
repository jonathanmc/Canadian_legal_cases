    (“Huronia”) appeal from an order made on January 11, 2019. The motion judge
    granted Ms. Rachel Rumsam’s motion to add Dr. Caroline Kargel as a defendant in
    the underlying action on the ground that the claim against Dr. Kargel was not
    statute-barred. Dr. Pakes and Huronia claim the motion judge: </span></p>

    5(1) which provides that a claim is discoverable when the plaintiff has or <em><span

    v. Ultramar Limited</em>, 2011 ONCA 91, 76 C.B.R. (5th) 153<em> </em>that a
    plaintiff must exercise reasonable diligence to discover a claim after being
    advised of a “triggering event”.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 11, 2007, Ms. Rumsam attended Huronia
    for treatment of a wrist injury. Dr. Pakes assessed her wrist and ordered an
    x-ray.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Pakes reviewed the film and pointed out to
    Ms. Rumsam the indication of a possible hairline fracture of the scaphoid bone.
    He then discharged her with advice that she immobilize, rest, ice, and compress
    the wrist.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 16, 2007, Huronia received a mailed copy
    of the x-ray report prepared by a radiologist. The report confirmed a “suspected
    displaced scaphoid fracture” and recommended a follow up x-ray. In the bottom
    right hand corner, there is handwriting that says “dx scaphoid #” and
    underneath that notation, “N/A”. There is no signature. A physician at Huronia
    reviewed the report but Ms. Rumsam did not receive a phone call or letter that
    indicated that further follow up was required. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the pain in her wrist worsened, Ms. Rumsam
    visited her family doctor who referred her to an orthopaedic surgeon. She had
    surgery in April 2008 and again in August 2008. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Rumsam reached the age of majority on June
    4, 2010. She commenced an action in negligence against Dr. Pakes and Huronia on
    May 3, 2012. She claimed that Dr. Pakes and Huronia failed to advise her that
    follow up medical consultation was required and failed to notify her of the
    x-ray which indicated that a follow up x-ray should be done, resulting in the
    need for further surgeries for which she sought damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 17, 2012, Huronia and Dr. Pakes
    filed the statement of defence, which alleged that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The report [confirming the scaphoid fracture]
    was reviewed by a physician at the Clinic, who then attempted to contact the
    Plaintiff at the telephone number provided by the Plaintiff in order to advise her
    of the findings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response to a motion brought by Dr. Pakes and
    Huronia, Ms. Rumsam served a responding factum dated August 29, 2013. In the
    factum, Ms. Rumsam makes the following statement: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On July 12 [2007] (the following day), <span
class=Underline>a clinic physician other than Dr. Pake [</span><span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar>sic</span><span class=Underline>]</span> placed a
    telephone call to Rachel’s home number to advise her about the x-ray findings
    and the radiologist’s recommendation for a follow up x-ray. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the examination for discovery of Dr.
    Pakes on August 7, 2014, the radiologist’s report was produced. Dr. Pakes
    interpreted the note “dx scaphoid fracture N/A” to indicate a diagnosis (“dx”)
    of scaphoid fracture, and that the call to the patient was not answered
    (“N/A”). He was not able to say who wrote the note. Counsel for Dr. Pakes gave
    an undertaking to advise who wrote the note. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 17, 2016, 18 months later, counsel
    for Dr. Pakes and Huronia complied with the undertaking, advising that Dr.
    Kargel wrote the note, except for the “N/A”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 15, 2016, counsel for Dr. Pakes and
    Huronia advised Ms. Rumsam’s counsel that, contrary to Dr. Pakes’ earlier
    statement, there was no evidence that anyone had ever attempted to call Ms.
    Rumsam.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 18, 2017, Ms. Rumsam moved to add Dr.
    Kargel as a defendant on the basis that Dr. Kargel reviewed the x-ray report
    which indicated a potential scaphoid fracture, but she failed to advise and
    treat her, and this resulted in delayed treatment of the fracture making
    surgeries necessary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Pakes and Huronia opposed the motion to add
    Dr. Kargel as a defendant, arguing that the claim against Dr. Kargel was
    statute-barred pursuant to the <em>Limitations Act</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Relevant provisions of the <em>Limitations Act</em></span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>Limitations Act</em> provides as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span lang=EN-CA>4</span></strong><span
lang=EN-CA> Unless this Act provides otherwise, a proceeding shall not be
    commenced in respect of a claim after the second anniversary of the day on
    which the claim was discovered. </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span lang=EN-CA>5</span></strong><span
lang=EN-CA> (1) A claim is discovered on the earlier of,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) the day on which the person with

  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(i) that the injury, loss or
    damage had occurred,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(ii) that the injury, loss or
    damage was caused by or contributed to by an act or omission,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(iii) that the act or omission
    was that of the person against whom the claim is made, and</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(iv) that, having regard to the

    person with the abilities and in the circumstances of the person with the claim
    first ought to have known of the matters referred to in clause (a).</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge’s decision</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge concluded that the claim
    against Dr. Kargel was not statute-barred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At paragraph 70 of the ruling on motion, he correctly
    identified s. 5 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> as the relevant codification of
    discoverability and he recognized that “the <em>Limitations Act</em> imposes a
    presumptive two-year limitation period during which a plaintiff may commence an
    action … a person with a claim is presumed to have known of that claim on the
    day the act or omission took place, unless the contrary is proved.” (It is
    agreed that the presumptive limitation period did not begin to run until June
    4, 2010, when Ms. Rumsam reached the age of majority.)</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He also recognized that a plaintiff has “a
    positive obligation to exercise reasonable diligence in discovering the
    material facts upon which her cause of action is founded” as set out in this
    court’s decision in <em>Pepper v. Zellers</em> <em>Inc. </em>(2006), 83 O.R.
    (3d) 648 (C.A.). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge held, however, that the
    reference in the statement of defence to the fact that “[t]he report was
    reviewed by a physician at the Clinic” was not sufficient to alert Ms. Rumsam
    to a claim against another doctor since Dr. Pakes was himself a “physician at
    the Clinic” and the appellants “were collectively unable to answer the more
    important aspect of the notation: who was the author of ‘N/A’”. The motion
    judge concluded that:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Query then how a reasonable person with the
    Plaintiff’s abilities and in her circumstances ought to have discovered Dr.
    Kargel’s identity within the presumptive limitation period, when it took two
    physicians, who are presumably intimately aware of the documentary procedures,
    processes and staff at the Huronia Clinic, 23 months to answer only the most
    obvious aspect of the notation “dx scaphoid fracture N/A”: that she suffered a
    broken wrist.  Yet the same two physicians are unable to identify who it was
    that failed to communicate with the Plaintiff in respect of the report, if not
    Dr. Kargel.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He held that it was reasonable to conclude that Ms.
    Rumsam was unable to identify Dr. Kargel as the physician who wrote the
    handwritten note and thus, arguably failed to communicate with her until November
    15, 2016, when counsel for Dr. Pakes and Huronia complied with the undertaking,
    advising that no one from the clinic had called Ms. Rumsam. He therefore held
    that the claim against Dr. Kargel was not statute-barred.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As to the two drivers, Orsini and Palmer, it
    is clear that all the information about their identities and the statements
    made to the police, plus the latter's report, were readily available with any
    degree of diligence, and were actually obtained by solicitor Kirkland, by early
    1999. <span class=Underline>It is not necessary to answer the question of how
    and why the deceased went to the highway and walked on it in order to decide if
    there was a cause of action against one or both of these drivers for running
    him down. Nor was it necessary to determine which driver did it</span>. It is
    highly likely that only a trial could answer that question. <span
class=Underline>Perfect certainty is not necessary. The reasonable person would
    have known by the receipt of the police information in early 1999, or at the
    latest by the time Mrs. Coutanche reviewed the police report in September 1999,
    that there was a possible claim against these drivers</span>. There is no room
    on the record before us for the application of discoverability to delay the
    commencement of the running of the limitation against the drivers for a
    sufficient period to bring the start of the limitation to February 22, 2000,
    two years before the commencement of the action. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    having the precise name of a defendant is not required as long as the name can

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On February 17, 2000, Ms. Safai knew that she
    had fallen and injured her ankle. <span class=Underline>She knew that she
    likely had a claim for her injuries against the owner of the property.  As of
    the date of the accident, she was in a position to ascertain the name of the
    registered owner of the property</span>. Reasonable diligence on her part and
    on the part of her lawyer produced the name of the registered owner of the
    building in due course. <span class=Underline>In my view, there is simply no
    reasonable basis in these circumstances to invoke the discoverability rule to
    postpone the commencement of the limitation period</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
