    increasing resistance to visits with his father. The trial judge concluded that
    the mother systematically and successfully poisoned the child’s relationship with
    his father. The mother was clearly uninterested in participating in therapy with
    a view to encouraging the child to reconcile with his father. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that the child’s long-term
    best interests favoured a reversal of custody and a suspension of access,
    intended to be time-limited, to the mother and her allies, in the hopes that
    the father and son could achieve some rapprochement. Accordingly, by judgment
    dated October 30, 2018, the trial judge ordered an immediate custody reversal
    and prohibited contact between the child and his mother and siblings for six months,
    with custody and access to be reviewed at the end of the six-month period,
    subject to certain conditions. In his reasons on motion dated January 18, 2019,
    the trial judge further ordered no contact between the child and the mother’s
    extended family. </span></p>

    this court has reiterated many times, an appeal court must not retry a custody

    for the task facing a trial judge in difficult family law cases, especially
    those involving custody and access issues”: <em>C.S. v. M.S.,</em></span> 2010

    exercises in discretion. Case by case consideration of the unique circumstances

    from the children’s lives began well before separation, as the trial judge
    noted:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[26] The Applicant Father testified that in
    the years prior to separation, starting in 2010, the Respondent Mother began
    criticizing the Applicant Father in front of the children for not making enough
    money. In front of the children she also said he could not wash dishes or fold
    laundry properly. The situation worsened in 2012, when the maternal grandmother
    started to spend two to four days per week at the family home. She joined in
    the criticism of the Applicant Father’s inadequacies in providing for the
    family or helping with household duties in front of the children. The incessant
    nattering often ended with the Applicant Father and Respondent Mother engaging
    in yelling and screaming at each other. The Applicant Father testified that he
    would often end these arguments by leaving the matrimonial home. When he
    returned, the Respondent Mother had locked the door and he had to plead for 15
    minutes with the children to let him in. This was a humiliating experience for
    him.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[27] Starting in 2012, the Respondent Mother
    prohibited the Applicant Father from driving the children to school. The
    Respondent Mother and children would often visit the Respondent Mother’s family
    farm for stretches of time without the applicant Father. The Respondent Mother
    and the children began to impose rules on the Applicant Father in the home. He
    was not permitted to eat with them at the table. He was not permitted to sit in
    the family room with the children as they watched television. The children told
    him to leave and the Respondent Mother did not intervene. He was not permitted
    to drive the children to their doctor’s appointments. He was not permitted to
    wish the children goodnight. He was not permitted to enter the youngest child, [B.]’s,
    room.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[28] The Respondent Mother, according to the
    Applicant Father’s evidence, told him in these years prior to the separation
    that the children did not like him and did not need him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The social worker retained to convey the child’s
    wishes reported that the mother’s strongly negative feelings towards the father
    had contributed to the child’s wish to discontinue visits with his father. The
    mother transmitted verbal and non-verbal communication to the children that
    revealed her disdain for the father and her disapproval of his parenting. Similarly,
    the trial judge found that mother was averse to the father playing any role in
    the child’s life:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[163] The Respondent Mother does not hide the
    fact that she sees no benefit to the child having a relationship with the Applicant

    they wanted nothing to do with the Applicant Father, but his shortcomings were
    not the issue. Issues identified by the children (for example his driving, ants
    and rats in his house, and physical abuse) were not grounded in reality. They
    were figments planted by the Respondent Mother or created by the children

    improperly applied the best interests of the child test. Their arguments mainly
    focused on how the trial judge failed to consider the potentially catastrophic
    consequences of custody reversal for the child, overemphasized the mother’s bad
    conduct, and failed to give the child’s wishes any weight. However, the mother
    and OCL do not dispute any of the factual findings that informed the best
    interests of the child analysis. It is thus difficult to challenge the trial
    judge’s discretionary weighing of the different factors. </span></p>

    child’s ties to his mother and the short-term disruption that would result from
    a transfer of custody to the father. The child was having difficulties while
    living with his mother. He had assaulted her. The mother struggled to meet the
    child’s educational needs. While the child had lived almost exclusively with
    the mother for four years, the trial judge did not consider this a stable home
    environment, due to the mother’s inadequate and emotionally abusive parenting.

    to continue to be exposed to the destructive parenting of the Respondent
    Mother. The long-term detrimental impact on the child of a permanently severed

    role of determining the best interests of the child just because the child will

    order under appeal, does not directly order the child or the mother to
    participate in therapy. Rather, it sets participation in therapy as a prerequisite
    to the fixed date review of the change in custody. If the child or the mother
    refused to participate in the therapeutic process, they would lose the
    opportunity to have a fixed date review of the change in custody, without the
    need to show a change of circumstances. In that sense, the order made still
    left some scope for choice on their part as to participation in the therapy and
    the question of forcing treatment on an unwilling participant does not directly
    arise. This would be sufficient to dismiss this ground of appeal. </span></p>

    for instance, the order of January 18, 2019, with reasons reported at 2019 ONSC
    527. As such, it is useful to review the extent of a judge’s authority to make

    the needs of the child and the ability and willingness of the parties to
    satisfy the needs of the child. Not infrequently, the professional might
    recommend a course of treatment to promote the well-being of the child: see,
    for instance, <em>Leelaratna v. Leelaratna</em></span>, 2018 ONSC 5983<span

  <h3>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>  Effect of the <i>HCCA</i> on a court’s ability to make therapeutic

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The OCL argued that if the child refuses consent
    to therapy, the <em>HCCA </em>prevents a court from ordering the child to
    participate in therapy. This is because section 10 of the <em>HCCA</em> prohibits
    a health practitioner from administering treatment to a capable person without
    that person’s consent, and from administering treatment to an incapable person
    without the consent of the person’s substitute decision-maker:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>10 (1) A health practitioner who proposes a
    treatment for a person shall not administer the treatment, and shall take
    reasonable steps to ensure that it is not administered, unless,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) he or she is of the opinion that the
    person is capable with respect to the treatment, and the person has given
    consent; or</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) he or she is
    of the opinion that the person is incapable with respect to the treatment, and
    the person’s substitute decision-maker has given consent on the person’s behalf

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, there are some salient differences
    between the <em>HCCA </em>and the legislation directly governing custody cases. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>HCCA</em> concerns the relationship
    between individuals and health care practitioners. It sets up a statutory
    regime and an administrative tribunal, the Consent and Capacity Board (the
    Board), to resolve differing views about a patient’s wishes and capacity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>HCCA </em>also aims to protect of a
    person’s autonomy to make decisions about their own well-being, even if those
    decisions are not in their best interests. This prioritization of autonomy
    above best interests is noted in <em>Starson v. Swayze</em>, 2003 SCC 32, [2003]
    1 SCR 722, at para. 76: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The legislative mandate of the Board is to
    adjudicate solely upon a patient’s capacity. The Board’s conception of the
    patient’s best interests is irrelevant to that determination. As the reviewing
    judge observed, “[a] competent patient has the absolute entitlement to make
    decisions that any reasonable person would deem foolish” (para. 13). This point
    was aptly stated by Quinn J. in <em>Koch (Re)</em> (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 485
    (Gen. Div.), at p. 521:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>The right
    knowingly to be foolish is not unimportant; the right to voluntarily assume
    risks is to be respected. The State has no business meddling with either. The
    dignity of the individual is at stake. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Starson</em>, the only issue before the
    Board was whether Professor Starson was capable of refusing consent to
    medication. The wisdom of his decision should not have had any bearing on this
    determination. The Supreme Court of Canada ultimately ruled that the Board had
    inappropriately focused on Professor Starson’s best interests, and disregarded
    clear evidence of his capacity to refuse treatment. </span></p>

    and the child’s “best interests” norm:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[81] The general purpose of the “best
    interests” standard is to provide courts with a focus and perspective through
    which to act on behalf of those who are vulnerable. In contrast, competent
    adults are assumed to be “the best arbiter[s] of [their] own moral destiny”,
    and so are entitled to independently assess and determine their own best
    interests, regardless of whether others would agree when evaluating the choice
    from an objective standpoint.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[82] The
    application of an objective “best interests” standard to infants and very young
    children is uncontroversial. Mature adolescents, on the other hand, have strong
    claims to autonomy, but these claims exist in tension with a protective duty on
    the part of the state that is also justified [citations omitted]. </span></p>

    limit the courts’ jurisdiction to make therapeutic orders in the child’s best
    interests. A court must always consider a child’s view and preferences, but a
    child’s refusal to participate in a therapeutic intervention will not necessarily
    determine whether a court can make such an order. Rather, a court must assess
    the child’s maturity and weigh their wishes accordingly, in relation to the
    various factors listed in section 24(2) of the <em>Children’s Law Reform Act</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are of course risks in making therapeutic
    orders. The child may refuse to comply. A health care practitioner may consider
    that the child is capable and that he or she cannot override the child’s
    refusal. The attempts at therapeutic intervention may fail. Courts cannot fix
    every problem.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That said, time and time again, experienced
    family court judges have emphasized the value of access to a broad variety of
    remedial measures. Again, in <em>Leelaratna</em>, the trial judge observed,
    “there are often no legal solutions to family problems. Therapeutic orders can
    be very effective tools to help the family move forward, reduce the parental
    conflict, and help children transition though the emotional turmoil of their
    parents’ litigation in a healthier way”: at para. 52, see also <em>Fiorito</em>,
    where a reversal of custody and therapy was ordered to remedy a father’s
    estrangement from his children. Judges deciding custody cases should be enabled
    to create or support the conditions which are most conducive to the flourishing
    of the child. </span></p>

    judge hears from all the witnesses and as such, is in the best position to assess
    the child’s best interests. If there is no error in law, no palpable and
    overriding error of fact, and no misapprehension of evidence, appeal courts
    should not interfere. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there was no such error in this case. The trial judge considered the
    views and preferences of the child as conveyed through the OCL. He ultimately
    concluded the mother had poisoned the child against the father and the child’s
    wishes were not his own. That is, the child lacked the requisite maturity to
    refuse counselling with his father. As addressed earlier, absent a challenge to
    this factual finding, the trial judge was entitled to put no weight on the
    child’s wishes. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reasonably concluded that the child’s best interests required
    contact with the father and reconciliation therapy, over the child’s heated
    objections. Without any conclusive evidence that such orders are ineffective —
    see for instance, <span lang=EN-CA>Nicholas C. Bala and Katie Hunter, “Children

    explore the application of the <em>HCCA</em> to the order for counseling made

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We admit the fresh evidence on the appeal but
    this court is not in a position to weigh the conflicting evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Each of the parties has filed large amounts of
    fresh evidence relating to events following the trial. The child has behaved
    badly. The father says that the mother has repeatedly breached the court orders
    made by the trial judge and done everything she can to undermine the process crafted
    by the trial judge. The mother says the child is not doing well and should be
    returned to her care. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police had to assist in transport of the
    child to his father’s home, and the child has run away on numerous occasions.
    The trial judge, who remained seized of the matter, outlined some of the
    further problems at paras. 2-4 of his reasons on a post-trial motion heard
    January 9, 2019, reported at 2019 ONSC 527:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[2] … [The child] has also engaged in other rebellious
    behaviour since the trial decision. He would leave his father’s home early in
    the morning and return late at night if at all. He has, with the assistance of
    friends, vandalized his father’s home and contents of the home, completely
    trashing his father’s home office work space. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[3] He was refusing to eat any of the food
    prepared for him by his father and demanded money from his father for takeout
    food.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[4] He has alleged
    to the school, neighbours, police and Children’s Aid Society (“CAS”) that his
    father has been abusive towards him, and does not have adequate food or bedroom
    furniture for him. He has attempted to engage the CAS and the police to become
    involved. Both agencies have investigated and have not verified any of his
    concerns. The CAS has investigated the concerns and plans to close the file.
    The father has accommodated [the child]’s requests for bedroom furnishing,
    buying new items. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The mother continued to violate the trial
    judge’s orders and undermine the child’s restoration of a relationship with the
    father, as the trial judge observed at paras.15-17:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[15] Since the trial decision was released on
    October 30, 2018, the mother admits to only a few occasions of brief contact
    with the child. In the materials that the mother has filed at the Court of
    Appeal and before me, she has clearly displayed a complete lack of appreciation
    for the counterintuitive message she has given to the child. She has failed to
    include in any of her affidavit evidence that she has in any way discouraged
    the rebellious and destructive conduct and disrespectful attitude of [the child]
    towards his father. Not once did she claim that she has told the child to
    submit to his father’s custodial authority, that he attend school or Cadets, or
    that he cooperate with his father in attending counselling in accordance with
    the court expectations. She has shown to the court and to the child that she is
    unable to accept the trial decision, and therefore has continued to act in a
    manner that is contrary to the child’s best interest</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[16] Rather than admonishing [the child] for
    his defiant, rebellious, and self-destructive conduct and encouraging him to
    comply with the court order, she used his behavioral meltdown as evidence in
    support of her unsuccessful motion to stay. Surprisingly, the OCL supported the
    mother in this litigation strategy.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[17] In light of
    the messaging presented to [the child], there is little wonder that he has
    struggled so tremendously to accept the transition to his father’s care and
    custody. To her credit, the mother is now (in her submissions for this motion)
    articulating a desire to facilitate a smooth transition for the child to get
    him back on track with school and Cadets and to support the current court order
    for this part of his life. The child need his mother to not only say these
    things, but also to mean what she says.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge left the original six month
    review in place but made ancillary orders to promote the goal of
    reconciliation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Matters got worse and the trial judge heard
    three motions on May 28, 2019, with reasons reported at 2019 ONSC 3503. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge described the continuing
    problems and his response to the mother’s request for access or the return of
    the child at paras. 3-10:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[3] The evidence clearly establishes that on
    the surface [the child] is not doing well. He is not attending school, not
    attending Cadets, has caused damage to his father’s home, refuses to submit to
    his father’s rules, attends at his mother’s home and communicates with his GM
    [maternal grandmother] contrary to non-contact orders and runs away from
    father’s home several times a week requiring engagement of the police for
    assistance in locating and returning him.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[4] On the other hand, [the child] has shown
    some glimpses of progress toward the goal of rebuilding his relationship with
    his father (“the goal”). He has engaged in some meaningful discussions with his
    father regarding a plan for his education and he willingly attended a dinner
    out and a Raptor’s game with his father. He has also resided primarily at his
    father’s residence in compliance with my orders. Unfortunately, he also
    continues to display very blatant acts of disrespect towards his father,
    recently pouring the bulk of contents of 2 water bottles over his father’s head
    while laughing.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[5] I do not agree with the OCL and the
    Respondent Mother that [the child] is in crisis, or at least not a crisis over
    which he has no control. He is not a child without options who is forced to
    live on the street. He has the option of living under the roof provided by his
    father and eating the food provided by his father. He has the option to bathe
    at his father’s, attend school, Cadets and therapy. He chooses not to. If he is
    in crisis it is because he is not allowed to have what he wants – to reside
    with his mother. The solution is not to give in to his rebellious behaviour and
    give him what he wants. I am more concerned about what he needs.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[6] The suspension of contact between [the
    child] and his mother and her family is not meant as a punishment for [the
    child] or anyone else. The suspension of contact is meant to eliminate the
    distraction from the goal.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[7] Unfortunately the distractions caused by
    the Respondent Mother and GM in particular go well beyond inane distractions
    such as a squirrel is to a dog.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[8] The reversal of custody and suspension of
    access was not meant to be a permanent solution. The purpose of these and the
    many related orders was to get everyone, as Mr. Ludmer suggested, on the same
    path, or to use another metaphor, the plan was to get everyone in the same boat
    and paddling in the same direction. By allowing [the child] the option of
    maintaining contact with the negative influence of the Respondent Mother and
    GM, these individuals are telling [the child] that he does not have to comply
    with court orders or work on his relationship with his father.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[9] To allow continued contact or to grant the
    Respondent Mother’s request to return [the child]’s residence to the Respondent
    Mother, is to return [the child] to the situation he experienced prior to the
    order reversing custody. The findings I made after 11 days of trial clearly
    established that such a situation was not in [the child]’s best interest.
    Although he was attending school more regularly and attending Cadets,
    psychological dysfunction caused by the alienating conduct of the Respondent
    Mother had started to set in. [The child] had started to skip school, had
    become addicted to video games and had become oppositional to his mother. All
    of this was on top of showing a total lack of respect for the Applicant Father.
    In my view, cracks were starting to form in [the child]’s foundational needs to
    show respect for authority and in particular, his parents. I cannot place [the
    child] back into that situation.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[10] However, it is evident to me that the
    current situation is also not working. There is no evidence that the Respondent
    Mother has accepted the trial findings regarding alienation and the value of [the
    child]’s relationship with the Applicant Father. Until that happens, I cannot
    be assured that everyone will be on the same boat and on the same path toward
    the goal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 4, 2019, the child and his friend came
    to the father’s home. The child’s friend assaulted the father (age 70) with his
    fist. The child and his friend left the home as the father called police. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 11, 2019, the child climbed to the roof
    of the father’s home. The child threatened to beat his father up when the
    father asked him to come down. When the child did come down from the roof, he physically
    attacked his father, leaving the father with severe bruises to his head, and
    injury to his arm. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 17, 2019, the child and his friend
    threatened to beat the father to death in the basement of his home. The child
    assaulted his father. The father suffered significant bruising and swelling to
    his face, eye, head and ear. The father contacted police and the child was
    charged. Ultimately the child was released on condition he have no contact with
    his father. Given the court orders preventing contact with the mother, the
    child was found to be a child in need of protection and is now in a foster
    placement pursuant to an order of the Ontario Court of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 31, 2019, the father was advised the
    child went absent from the foster home without permission. Police later that
    day advised the father that the child had stolen a cell phone from another
    child. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 6, 2019, in an incident apparently
    related to the child’s robbery of another child, the child himself was
    assaulted and suffered broken bones under his eye. He required surgery and had
    plates implanted in his face. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There have been significant changes since the
    trial judge’s decision of October 30, 2018. The child is now approaching his 15th
    birthday and seems even more entrenched in his attitude towards his father. The
    process that the trial judge contemplated has not gone well. Considering the
    serious credibility issues in this case, the Superior Court is best positioned
    to deal with these new developments. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge has not erred in any respect
    justifying appellate intervention. The appeal is dismissed. The parties may
    make brief written submissions as to the costs of this appeal, due within 30
    days of the release of these reasons from the father, and within 15 days
    thereafter from the mother. </span></p>

    case seems to have had a very happy ending. In a subsequent hearing Hebner J. observed
    that: “On the evidence as a whole, I find that a change in custody has made a
    remarkable difference in the relationship these three girls have with their
    father. In fact, I can safely say that the change in custody has saved that
    relationship. Were it not for the change in custody, I have no doubt whatsoever
    that the children would not have any sort of relationship with their father”:
