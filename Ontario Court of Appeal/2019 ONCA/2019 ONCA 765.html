  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Fairburn J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Meningitis destroyed a portion of Ms. Walker’s brain when she was
    only five months old. She spent most of her young childhood moving between
    family homes. She was sometimes abused in those homes. She was eventually
    placed into the care of the Children’s Aid Society. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By the time she was 10 years of age, </span>Ms.
    Walker started experiencing seizures, and by the time that she was 14 years of
    age, she began self-harming. Repeated suicide attempts followed. This led to a
    steady and relentless cycle of involuntary admissions to psychiatric facilities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When she was 30 years of age, Ms. Walker started
    accumulating a few criminal convictions, but was never sent to the
    penitentiary. Then, on March 6, 2009, when Ms. Walker was 34 years of age, she stabbed
    a woman in the heart. But for the immediate response of medical professionals,
    the woman would have died. On January 12, 2010, Ms. Walker entered guilty pleas
    to aggravated assault, carrying a concealed weapon and breach of probation in
    relation to the incident. On March 21, 2012, she was declared a dangerous
    offender and an indeterminate sentence was imposed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The dangerous offender hearing was as complex a hearing
    as the courts see. The experienced trial Crown acknowledged that it was a
    “unique hearing”, in large measure because Ms. Walker’s actual criminal record
    did not necessarily support a pattern of conduct that would have met the
    requirements for a dangerous offender finding. Accordingly, the Crown set out
    to prove over 40 “prior acts of violence and threats of violence” that had
    never resulted in criminal charges, let alone convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The hearing was made all the more complex by the
    fact that Ms. Walker was a difficult, self-represented accused. She is a person
    who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, borderline
    intellectual functioning and dysthymia, a persistent depressive condition. The
    expert evidence suggests, and her behaviour in court shows, that she has
    problems with interpersonal relationships, impulsivity, and difficulty
    controlling her anger. She easily decompensates, has paranoid ideation and
    experiences severe dissociative symptoms. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker has been described as having “limited
    intellectual functioning secondary to the brain damage she suffered as a
    child”. Neuropsychological tests showed that she possesses a “composite measure
    of general intelligence, fall[ing] below the 1<sup>st</sup> percentile, in the
    Extremely Low range.” There was evidence before the court that her cognitive challenges
    undermine her ability to weigh options and appreciate the consequences of her
    behaviour. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It would be a significant oversight not to
    acknowledge the enormously difficult task confronting the hearing judge.
    Against the backdrop of a highly complex and lengthy hearing, she had to manage
    a very difficult, frequently intransigent, often vulgar and sometimes violent
    self-represented accused. The record clearly displays the hearing judge’s
    dedication to controlling the proceeding and navigating it fairly to a just
    conclusion. The hearing judge appointed <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>to assist
    her in meeting that goal.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker, who is represented on appeal, appeals
    the dangerous offender finding and indeterminate sentence imposed. She claims
    that she has been the subject of a miscarriage of justice arising from what she
    describes as a number of procedural errors that created both an appearance of
    unfairness and actual unfairness in the dangerous offender proceeding. Ms.
    Walker contends that the unfairness can be seen in several ways:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span lang=EN-CA><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>a failure to give her an opportunity to make an
    informed choice about whether to proceed with or without counsel when she
    desperately needed one; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span lang=EN-CA><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>a failure to inquire into her fitness when the
    circumstances cried out for such an inquiry; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span lang=EN-CA><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>a failure of <em>amicus curiae</em> to resist
    the admission of institutional records elicited to assist in establishing a
    pattern of conduct justifying a finding of dangerousness pursuant to s. 753(1)(a)(i)
    and (ii) of the <em>Criminal Code,</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em>R.S.C.,
    1985, c. C-46;  </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span lang=EN-CA><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>a failure of <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>to explore
    adequate substitutes for Ms. Walker’s presence in court when she was no longer
    able to “psychologically … handle” the proceedings; and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2 style='text-align:justify;'><span lang=EN-CA><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>amicus curiae’s</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> closing argument, at the end of the proceedings, and in Ms. Walker’s absence, advocating
    in favour of finding Ms. Walker a dangerous offender and imposing an
    indeterminate sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At its core, this case comes down to whether
    there has been a miscarriage of justice occasioned by failing to put in place sufficient
    procedural safeguards to ensure a fair proceeding for a self-represented
    accused with mental, behavioural, and cognitive challenges, who was entirely
    incapable of representing herself, and who faced an application that could
    deprive her of her liberty for the rest of her life. Despite the extraordinary
    effort put into the hearing, I conclude that there were several actions and
    inactions that resulted in both the appearance of unfairness and actual
    unfairness giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. I would allow the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE INDEX OFFENCE </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 6, 2009, Ms. Walker got into an
    argument with a third party at a drop-in centre. When the complainant attempted
    to intervene in that argument, the appellant took a paring knife from her purse
    and stabbed the complainant in the chest, puncturing her heart. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker was charged with a number of
    offences, including attempted murder. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE FIRST GUILTY PLEA</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 15, 2009, about two months following the
    stabbing incident, Ms. Walker pled guilty to the attempted murder charge. Before
    doing so, she informed the court that she had discharged her lawyer on this
    matter and intended to proceed on her own. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A pre-sentence report was ordered. When the report
    was returned, it revealed that Ms. Walker had a version of events that
    suggested that she may have been acting in self-defence. Upon learning that
    information, the court decided to appoint <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>to
    assist. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Once on the record, based upon discussions she
    had with Ms. Walker, <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>expressed concern that Ms.
    Walker might not be able to understand the proceedings, conduct a defence, or
    instruct counsel. The court joined in those concerns. Accordingly, on August 21,
    2009, a fitness assessment was ordered pursuant to s. 672.11(a) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em><i>. </i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The October 1, 2009 fitness report resulted in
    the suggestion that Ms. Walker was then fit to stand trial: “Ms. Walker
    presents currently as fit to stand trial.” When the matter returned to court on
    October 13, 2009, a fitness hearing was not conducted. Instead, on the basis of
    Ms. Walker’s claim that she may have been acting in self-defence, the plea was
    struck and the matter was set down for trial. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE SECOND GUILTY PLEA </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 12, 2010, the matter came up for
    trial before a different judge. Given that this judge ultimately presided over
    the dangerous offender proceeding, I will refer to her as the “hearing judge”. The
    appellant again appeared without counsel. As will be discussed shortly, the matter
    appears to have proceeded on the assumption that Ms. Walker did not wish to
    retain counsel. At the request of the previous judge who had presided over the
    initial plea, the <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>followed the matter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown was prepared to permit Ms. Walker to plead
    guilty to aggravated assault, carrying a concealed weapon and breach of
    probation. However, the Crown was clear that, whatever the plea, if Ms. Walker
    was convicted, the Crown would be seeking a lengthy penitentiary term or a long
    term or dangerous offender designation. Ms. Walker equivocated on whether she
    would even enter a plea. Ms. Walker spoke with <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>after
    the court encouraged her to do so. After a court break, <em>amicus</em> informed
    the court that “an agreement” had been reached and Ms. Walker would be pleading
    guilty. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The hearing judge conducted a plea inquiry,
    impressing upon Ms. Walker the implications of pleading guilty, including that
    the Crown might seek a dangerous offender designation. The hearing judge
    explained that this meant that she could receive a “life sentence”. Ms. Walker
    then pled guilty and admitted the facts read into the record by Crown counsel.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>GENERAL NATURE OF THE DANGEROUS OFFENDER
    PROCEEDING</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Shortly after the pleas were entered, the court ordered
    an assessment for the purposes of a dangerous offender proceeding pursuant to s.
    752.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. More than two years later, the
    dangerous offender finding was made. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The stabbing through the heart incident was an
    obvious “serious personal injury offence” within the meaning of s. 752 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. Accordingly, the real issues for determination at the dangerous
    offender hearing were: whether Ms. Walker constituted a “threat to the life,
    safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons” on the basis that she
    had engaged in a “pattern of repetitive behaviour” or “persistent aggressive
    behaviour” within the meaning of ss. 753(a)(i) or (ii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>;
    and, if so, whether something less than an indeterminate sentence would provide
    adequate protection to the public pursuant to s. 753(4.1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. As I have already mentioned, in addition to Ms. Walker’s criminal
    record, the trial Crown set out to prove dozens of prior acts of violence and
    threats of violence, calling over 30 witnesses to testify and filing a large
    number of institutional records. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker was detained at the Vanier
    Correctional Centre for Women. Between the time of her arrest and October 3,
    2011, when the operational manager from Vanier testified at the hearing, Ms.
    Walker had spent 675 days in the segregation unit on 23-hour lockup. Ms.
    Walker’s mental condition deteriorated as the dangerous offender hearing
    progressed. The fact that Ms. Walker was in segregation for so much time could
    have contributed to that situation: <em>Canadian Civil Liberties Association v.
    Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2019 ONCA 243, 144 O.R. (3d) 641, at paras.
    62-77, leave to appeal requested, 38574. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The record overflows with her emotional roller
    coaster. At times she was belligerent, berating and sometimes threatening all
    those involved in the proceeding. At other times she was obstinate and listless
    and refused to speak. At yet other times she was emotional, crying and saying
    she was a “fucking failure” and wanted to kill herself, and begged not to hear any
    more evidence. At times she came to court and was engaged, testifying on more
    than one occasion, while at other times she refused to even come out of the
    cells. Eventually she refused to come to court altogether. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The result was that Ms. Walker was not present in
    the courtroom during critical evidence, including the testimony of the
    psychiatrists who provided expert evidence about her psychological challenges
    and her potential manageability within the community. At the end of the
    hearing, again without Ms. Walker present, both Crown counsel and <em>amicus
    curiae</em><i> </i>advocated in favour of finding her a dangerous offender and imposing
    an indeterminate sentence. The hearing judge concurred. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A dangerous offender proceeding is one of the
    most serious proceedings known to law. It not only asks whether a person should
    have a label of dangerousness attached to him or her for life, but also whether
    the person should be at risk of having his or her right to liberty removed for
    life. The seriousness of such an inquiry to both the individual and to society is
    beyond dispute. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The public’s confidence in the administration of
    justice is inextricably linked to the rule of law. The rule of law is threatened
    when the public loses confidence in the justice system. Both actual and
    perceived unfairness in the court system can shake that confidence. That is why
    “procedural fairness must be jealously guarded and strictly enforced”,
    particularly in proceedings where the individual and societal stakes are high,
    like dangerous offender proceedings: <em>R. v. McDonald</em><i>, </i>2018 ONCA
    369, 360 C.C.C. (3d) 494, at para. 41. For the reasons that follow, I conclude
    that the dangerous offender proceeding was not procedurally fair. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I will start by addressing two interrelated
    issues: the failure to adequately explore whether Ms. Walker wished to proceed
    as a self-represented accused and the failure to explore her fitness. As the
    balance of the issues engage, at least at some level, the alleged failings of <em>amicus
    curiae</em><i>, </i>after addressing the first two issues I will then turn to the
    law respecting the appointment of <i>amicus </i>and the specific role that <em>amicus</em><i> </i>was expected to perform in this case. That will be followed by a discussion
    of the applications to admit fresh evidence. I will conclude by addressing three
    examples of perceived and actual unfairness in the proceeding, which are linked
    to the role of <em>amicus</em>: </span></p>

    self-represented during the initial guilty plea proceeding. Three months after
    that plea was struck, Ms. Walker returned to court for a pre-scheduled,
    multi-day trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Everyone appears to have operated on the
    assumption that when Ms. Walker appeared for trial on January 12, 2010, she
    wished to proceed without counsel. This is evidenced by the hearing judge’s
    comment to Ms. Walker: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Now, I know you are representing yourself. You
    have a very competent and able lawyer here who is helping me [referring to <i>amicus
    curiae</i>], and who will also assist you. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker argues that the hearing judge erred
    by not inquiring into whether she wished to retain counsel at the outset of the
    proceeding on the first day scheduled for her trial, before she entered her
    second guilty plea. The respondent disagrees, claiming that the hearing judge
    was merely allowing Ms. Walker to act on her own conscious decision to be
    self-represented, a choice that had been exercised at the earlier guilty plea
    proceedings. Ms. Walker had had rocky relationships with lawyers, having previously
    discharged counsel in some matters and threatened former counsel in others. The
    respondent says that Ms. Walker clearly knew that she could retain counsel if
    she wished to do so. She simply made a considered and unequivocal choice not
    to. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent may be right that Ms. Walker most
    likely would not have retained counsel, even if the hearing judge had addressed
    the issue with her. Even so, in light of all of the surrounding circumstances, the
    matter should have been squarely addressed with her on the first day of trial
    before she entered her guilty pleas. I am of the view that, without that
    inquiry, and in the unique circumstances of this case, Ms. Walker’s “decision”
    to proceed without counsel cannot be characterized as an “informed” decision to
    proceed in that manner: <em>R. v. Romanowicz</em> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225
    (Ont. C.A.), at para. 36. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker was in profound jeopardy. Crown
    counsel announced at the outset that the Crown would be asking for a “very
    lengthy penitentiary term”, at a minimum, and possibly a dangerous offender designation.
    The aggravated assault charge that Ms. Walker was facing and to which she was considering
    pleading guilty would constitute the index offence for the dangerous offender
    hearing that could follow. The stakes were high for this accused with mental,
    behavioural and cognitive challenges. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first 25 pages of transcript from the first
    day scheduled for trial demonstrate why Ms. Walker was in desperate need of an
    advocate and why it was a significant oversight to fail to canvass the issue
    with her. Within the first hour of the proceedings, the following events
    occurred in the following order: </span></p>

    guilty because she had already done her “fucking time” and that there was no
    proof of the offence because there was no video, </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker’s difficulties were thus on
    full display in the first moments of the first day of the proceedings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While some accused find themselves without
    lawyers because they are denied state funding, no one has suggested that Ms.
    Walker would have been ineligible for funding. Whether she would have decided
    to retain a lawyer or not is not the issue. Whether she would have later fired
    any lawyer she retained is not the issue. The issue is that Ms. Walker’s
    self-represented status was considered a <em>fait accompli</em><i>. </i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The hearing judge never asked whether she wished
    to retain counsel at the outset of the proceedings, before she entered her
    second guilty plea. It was assumed she did not. Moreover, it was never
    explained to Ms. Walker that, in light of the severe jeopardy she was facing,
    she should strongly consider having legal representation and could be given an
    opportunity to further consider this option, if she so wished. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept that Ms. Walker made a conscious,
    informed decision to proceed without a lawyer when she came before the court
    for trial. At a minimum, the failure to squarely address the matter with her,
    and explain why she may benefit from actual legal representation, created an
    appearance of unfairness. </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>The failure to inquire into fitness</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the first minutes of the first day of the
    proceedings, when Ms. Walker was non-responsive to the hearing judge’s inquiries,
    the hearing judge asked <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>if she was satisfied that
    Ms. Walker could understand what was being said. <em>Amicus</em><i> </i>informed
    the court that Ms. Walker had been “found fit”. While there had been a fitness
    report prepared three months earlier, and Ms. Walker had been assessed as fit
    at that time, there had been no fitness hearing conducted and no finding of
    fitness made. In the over 26 months that followed, no one questioned Ms.
    Walker’s fitness again, except to the extent of baldly observing that she was
    “fit”. For instance, as will be addressed later in these reasons, <em>amicus</em><i> </i>took the position that the court should accede to Ms. Walker’s request to
    be absent from the dangerous offender hearing, partially on the basis that
    “[s]he is fit, so this choice seems to be a legitimate choice.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the appellant says that after the
    appellant came before the hearing judge, she showed obvious signs of being
    unfit and the matter should have been explored. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent says that there is no merit to
    the suggestion that Ms. Walker was unfit. The matter was raised before the
    initial trial judge and a fitness assessment was prepared on October 1, 2009.
    Ms. Walker was found to be fit by a psychiatrist at that time. The respondent
    maintains that there was nothing to suggest that Ms. Walker’s status changed
    after that report was authored. He argues that she demonstrated her ability to
    communicate with <em>amicus</em><i> </i>when she chose to, had a keen
    understanding of the consequences of the proceedings and was not a “confused
    spectator”. The respondent maintains that it would have been irresponsible to
    delay the proceedings to conduct a fitness hearing without an evidentiary
    foundation. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not share the respondent’s view. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The test for fitness has been referred to as a
    “limited cognitive capacity” test. The accused must have “sufficient mental
    fitness to participate in the proceedings in a meaningful way”: <em>R. v.
    Taylor</em> (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 323, at p. 338 (C.A.). In <em>R. v. Morrissey</em>,
    2007 ONCA 770, at para. 27, leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 102, this
    court commented on the limited cognitive capacity test: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It requires only a
    relatively rudimentary understanding of the judicial process — sufficient,
    essentially, to enable the accused to conduct a defence and to instruct counsel
    in that regard. It is in that sense that the accused must be able &quot;to
    communicate with counsel&quot; and relate the facts concerning the offence.</span></p>

    underscored the need for “meaningful presence and meaningful participation [of
    the accused] at the trial” and described these requirements as the “touchstones
    of the inquiry into fitness.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although an accused is presumed fit to stand
    trial, that presumption can be displaced upon a balance of probabilities: <em>Criminal

    issue of fitness is governed by Part XX.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The
    issue of fitness may be raised by either party or by the trial judge: ss. 672.12,
    672.23<i>. </i>As fitness can change over the course of a proceeding, there is
    no cap placed upon the number of fitness assessments that may be ordered in any
    given case. Likewise, there is no cap on the number of fitness hearings that
    may have to take place.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    present at the proceedings is akin to proceeding against a person who is not
    physically present at the proceedings. It has the effect of excluding that
    person from the proceedings. While courtroom efficiency is a laudable goal, it
    is not to be achieved at all costs. Where fitness concerns arise, they must be
    addressed. There is nothing irresponsible about halting proceedings to take
    steps to ensure that the subject of those proceedings is present in mind. </span></p>

    calling for at least an inquiry into fitness. The hearing judge maintained the
    ultimate responsibility for ensuring the fairness of the proceedings. Although <em>amicus</em><i> </i>could have raised the issue with the hearing judge, equally, the hearing
    judge could have raised the issue of her own accord. For that matter, Crown
    counsel could also have raised the issue. Yet no one did. </span></p>

    that Ms. Walker was “currently … fit to stand trial”. Of course, the report was
    authored in the wake of Ms. Walker’s first guilty plea and came before the
    Crown had definitively decided to pursue a dangerous offender designation. Ms.
    Walker would not be declared a dangerous offender for another two and a half
    years after that report was authored. </span></p>

    being clearly told that if she chose to plead guilty the matter would be
    remanded, Ms. Walker expressed through <i>amicus </i>that she wanted to be
    sentenced that day. She did not seem to comprehend what the hearing judge had
    tried to impress upon her: by pleading guilty, she was embarking upon a
    potentially very long journey before a sentence would be imposed. </span></p>

    application was being adjourned to May 30, 2011, at which point Ms. Walker
    asked, “On the dangerous offender?” The hearing judge said: “Yes, the Crown is
    applying that you be designated as a dangerous offender, and I expect that the
    evidence will commence on that day.” Ms. Walker responded in a confused
    fashion: “like I mean – like sentence stuff, I mean it’s all done, and I can do
    my time?” It is unclear whether Ms. Walker understood the potential outcomes of
    the dangerous offender application. </span></p>

    portion of the hearing, Ms. Walker expressed surprise and confusion as to why
    the Crown was eliciting evidence about past conduct. She thought that the
    witnesses would be testifying about what had happened during the stabbing
    incident that she had pled guilty to about 18 months before. </span></p>

    the hearing, Ms. Walker again expressed confusion about what was happening. She
    stated that she had already pled guilty for the incident and wanted to know
    “why are we talking about the misconduct, because it’s all done and over with,
    you know. That’s not going to change anything about my charge.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These excerpts provide some examples of Ms.
    Walker’s apparent failure to grasp the nature and object of the dangerous offender
    proceeding. She did not seem to understand the essential nature of what was
    happening around her, the reason for assessing her past acts, or that a life
    sentence was a very likely result of that proceeding. While she was often
    misbehaved, that misbehaviour was frequently linked to expressions of
    bewilderment about why there was so much attention cast upon her past conduct.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Indeed, nearing the point in the dangerous
    offender proceeding when Ms. Walker would draw a line in the sand, refusing to
    return to court, she had a full breakdown in court. The hearing judge
    interrupted the Crown’s submissions on Ms. Walker’s prior acts and asked Ms.
    Walker whether she was “able to follow what’s going on.” Ms. Walker replied,
    “[n]ot anymore” and asked the judge to “cancel” what she had testified to,
    saying she had been “stupid” to testify. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Gojer was the psychiatrist retained by <em>amicus</em><i> </i>to assess Ms. Walker. He prepared a report for use at the dangerous
    offender proceeding. The respondent relies upon a single, unsupported comment
    in Dr. Gojer’s report, where he said that there “are no issues with respect to
    fitness to stand trial or criminal responsibility”, as proof that Dr. Gojer
    found Ms. Walker fit. In my view, if Dr. Gojer meant that he came to a
    determination that Ms. Walker was fit and criminally responsible, he provides
    no support for those conclusions. Indeed, on one reading of the sentence, Dr.
    Gojer may have simply been commenting on the fact that he was not asked to
    opine on those “issues”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, Dr. Wilkie, the psychiatrist whom
    the Crown retained for the dangerous offender hearing, also made a comment
    about fitness in the report that she prepared for use at the hearing. Dr.
    Wilkie’s report pointed out that, although she had not been asked to opine upon
    fitness, Ms. Walker seemed to believe that “she had already been sentenced with
    respect to the index offenses and that therefore the current assessment process
    was redundant.” Nothing could be further from the truth. Ms. Walker had not
    been sentenced on the index offences and much turned on Dr. Wilkie’s
    assessment. This was yet another signal that Ms. Walker’s fitness may have been
    in issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I make no determination as to whether Ms. Walker
    was fit or not. What is critical for the purposes of this appeal is that a
    self-represented, mentally complex individual was before the court saying
    things that should have raised concerns about whether she was mentally present
    at the most important criminal proceeding she could face, one that could
    determine how she would live the rest of her life. This case cried out for the
    issue of fitness to be addressed. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I close on this issue by noting a jurisdictional
    point that was not raised by the parties. Sections 2 and 672.23(1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em><i> </i>refer to fitness being determined “before a verdict is
    rendered.” That language has given rise to a jurisprudential discussion about
    whether the fitness provisions within the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>are
    available for use only up to the time of a finding of guilt. If so, an issue
    arises as to the jurisdictional basis upon which to assess and determine
    fitness after a finding of guilt has been made. </span></p>

    concerns arise after a finding of guilt has been made, the proceedings cannot
    continue until the accused’s fitness has been assessed and determined. Some
    have suggested that jurisdiction at the sentencing stage lies in the common law;
    others have suggested that it lies in the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</em>; and still others have suggested that it lies in reading into the
    relevant statutory provisions by way of affording a constitutional remedy: <em>R.

    settle on the precise jurisdictional route to a fitness hearing after a finding
    of guilt has been made. We have not been asked to do so. Indeed, the respondent
    does not oppose this ground of appeal on the basis that the hearing judge was
    without jurisdiction to address fitness at the dangerous offender proceeding. In
    my view, the respondent is right not to have opposed on that basis. </span></p>

    offender proceeding was also unfair because <em>amicus curiae</em>: (a)
    conceded the admission and use of psychiatric records to prove prior violent
    acts; (b) failed to advocate for an adequate substitute for Ms. Walker’s
    presence in court; and (c) joined Crown counsel in advocating for a finding of
    dangerousness and an indeterminate sentence. In light of the appellant’s suggestion
    that <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>was central to the alleged unfairness of the
    proceeding, I will start by discussing the role assigned to <em>amicus</em><i> </i>in
    this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Judges have an overarching duty to protect the
    fairness of the proceedings before them. In the case of self-represented accused,
    there is a heavy onus placed upon judges to provide them with assistance: <em>R.
    v. Richards</em><i>, </i>2017 ONCA 424, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 284, at para. 112. That

    proceedings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Judges are frequently called upon to perform
    difficult balancing exercises: preserving their judicial roles as neutral and
    objective deciders, while at the same time assisting self-represented accused
    with advancing full answer and defence. In rare situations, despite a judge’s
    best efforts, he or she will not be in a position to alone ensure the fairness
    of a proceeding. In those situations, <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>may be
    required to assist the court in meeting that obligation.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is a self-evident truth that our justice
    system works best when a judge can dispassionately and objectively take into
    account opposing views advanced through the adversarial process. As noted by
    Doherty J.A. in <em>R. v. Joanisse</em><i> </i>(1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont.
    C.A.), at p. 57, leave to appeal refused, [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 347: “The

    challenges in complex cases involving self-represented accused with mental,
    behavioural, and/or cognitive challenges. In these types of situations, the adversarial
    process upon which the strength of our justice system is predicated risks
    losing much of its force. Accordingly, in complex cases where an accused person
    is “adamant about conducting the defence personally, but is hopelessly
    incompetent to do so”, the court may need the assistance of <em>amicus curiae</em><i> </i>to meet the court’s obligation to protect the fairness of the proceedings: <em>R.
    v. Imona-Russell</em><i>, </i>2019 ONCA 252<i>, </i>145 O.R. (3d) 197,<i> </i>at

    have contributed to unfairness, resolving whether there was a miscarriage of
    justice in this case has nothing to do with assessing the “performance” of <em>amicus</em><i> </i>through the lens of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
    Specifically, she argues that this court is not being asked to consider the
    first prong of such a claim, whether the lawyer fell below the standard
    expected of reasonably prudent counsel: <em>R. v. Gorburn</em><i>, </i>2017

    of the appellant’s position on appeal is inextricably linked to the actions and
    inactions of <em>amicus</em>. While it is true that the performance criteria
    within the ineffective assistance of counsel framework does not technically apply
    in this case, that does not make the fresh evidence inadmissible. In the
    somewhat unique circumstances here, and as a matter of fairness to counsel
    whose competence has been impugned, justice requires that she be permitted to

    process. This required that there be a counterbalance to the force of the
    prosecution’s case. This does not mean that <em>amicus</em><i> </i>was required
    to advance frivolous, time-consuming and unmeritorious arguments. Nor does it

    have raised the fact that: the records were created during Ms. Walker’s
    involuntary admissions to psychiatric facilities; some of her alleged comments

    put in place so that, even if she refused to come to court, Ms. Walker could at

    had previously attempted to look into conducting “this hearing while Ms. Walker

    was an entirely reasonable and appropriate decision. By this time in the
    proceeding, it was clear that Ms. Walker’s mental state was such that she
    presented a risk to herself and to anyone dealing with her. The hearing judge
    was properly concerned for the safety of all. In these circumstances, it was
    sensible to invoke s. 758(2)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, permitting an
    accused who is the subject of a dangerous offender hearing, to be “out of court
    during the whole or any part of the hearing on such conditions as the court
    considers proper.” The real issue was how to protect procedural fairness with
    Ms. Walker physically absent from the courtroom. </span></p>

    could not be accommodated within the courthouse. Although a video link to
    Vanier was a good option, the hearing judge felt that she could not order
    Vanier to do that without a formal application and the hearing of evidence. In
    response, <em>amicus</em><i> </i>said that Ms. Walker had told her if a video
    link was arranged, she would not listen.  <em>Amicus</em><i> </i>said that she
    felt she was in a “position where I really have to act in accordance with what

    could cause a delay of up to a year. Rather than embarking upon an inquiry into
    the available options for a video link, <em>amicus</em><i> </i>suggested that
    the best course was to permit Ms. Walker to be absent from the proceeding and
    simply provide her with transcripts of what happened in her absence: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I’m suggesting

    the respondent points out that there was a suggestion that if a video link was
    pursued, it could have delayed the proceeding. Ms. Walker knew that she could
    return to the courtroom if she wished to do so. Everyone struggled in the face
    of Ms. Walker’s misbehaviour, and, therefore, the respondent submits, the path
    chosen was a reasonable one. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>While I would not suggest that a video link is the only way that
    procedural fairness can be achieved when an offender is absent from a dangerous
    offender proceeding, at a minimum, fairness requires that this option be carefully
    explored. This is particularly true in the case of a self-represented accused. Although
    counsel should have assisted in that endeavour by doing as the hearing judge
    had asked, it was the hearing judge who was responsible for the fairness of the
    proceeding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    arrangements could not have been made to provide a video link.  Notably, on the
    very last day of court before judgment was given, a video link was in fact
    arranged so that the court could inquire into whether Ms. Walker wished to call
    evidence or make any closing submissions. She declined to do so. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    within the adversarial context of the proceeding. To return to the words of
    Fish J. in <em>CLA</em>, her “purpose [was] to provide the court with a

    offence for which she has been convicted forms a part.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The written submissions also expressed a dim view of Ms. Walker’s
    mental condition. For instance, <em>amicus</em><i> </i>opined that “it is hard
    not to regard” the appellant’s suicidal ideations and threats of self-harm “as
    cases of ‘crying wolf’.” In a literary flourish, <em>amicus</em><i> </i>continued: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Ms. Walker] is
    oppositional with respect to any suggestion of treatment. She has always
    spurned psychological help. She regards herself as sufficiently normal as not
    to need treatment or counselling. Indeed, she presents as someone whose pride
    will not allow her to acknowledge any such need. Much of her rage is against
    others and appears to stem from them not regarding her as normal; it may be
    that her greatest passion is to be so regarded. [Ms. Walker’s] behaviour can be
    viewed in operatic terms. [Ms. Walker] <u>[…] takes extreme offence at any
    whisper of insult. She appears never to have hardened herself to the insults
    she feels when regarded as a ‘retard’. She has a despot’s appetite for revenge.
    She would have anyone who looked at her the wrong way executed and would prefer
    to administer the execution herself. What she lacks is any of the cunning or
    subtlety of Richard III. Indeed the delivery of her explicit threats is
    suggestive of a complete lack of effective strategy in carrying them out.</u> [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The written submissions were accompanied by oral submissions of the
    same ilk: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker is just such a sad case. Just to
    cut to the chase here, as my friend has pointed out, there are, there is hope,
    but hope only if she wants to help herself. And that seems to be the vicious
    loop that she’s caught in. She has a bad deal with respect to the hardware that
    she’s been dealt. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>She seems to have a software in her brain that
    caught her up in vicious loops that she can’t escape. We wish that there was a
    pill she could take and the rages would disappear and she would become
    cooperative. Unfortunately, there isn’t. I guess the question would be if there
    was, if somehow she could be given a treatment order, but we don’t even have
    the pill, we don’t even have the treatment. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>And it’s bad because you know she’s going to
    have, Your Honour is going to have to find her a dangerous offender, that’s
    conceded. And it’s supposed to be to protect the public, but in fact it will punish
    her because jail is punishment. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>And we suspect, I think all of us, that she
    can no more help herself than an amputee can create a new limb. Something has
    got to sort of cut through the vicious cycles that she’s caught in, in order
    for her to be salvaged in some way. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>… but it’s clear
    that there’s no other solution for Your Honour. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent maintains that there was nothing wrong with <em>amicus</em> advocating as she did. According to the respondent, <em>amicus</em><i> </i>was
    merely acknowledging the obvious: the Crown’s case was an overwhelming and
    insurmountable one. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent’s position is consistent with what <em>amicus</em><i> </i>said during her cross-examination on the fresh evidence application. She
    acknowledged that she had no instructions from Ms. Walker to concede anything
    and that Ms. Walker did not see her written submissions. <em>Amicus’</em> position was based upon her view that there was no credible argument that could
    be made against the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. She personally
    thought that Ms. Walker was dangerous. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Undoubtedly, <em>amicus</em><i> </i>misunderstood her role. She had
    been appointed to assist the hearing judge in protecting the fairness of what
    was a complex and challenging proceeding. <em>Amicus</em><i> </i>was appointed
    because of the clear need to protect Ms. Walker’s interests and to balance out
    a highly skewed adversarial process. Rather than performing that role, she
    advocated against Ms. Walker and in a manner entirely antagonistic to Ms.
    Walker’s best interests. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It was the responsibility of <em>amicus</em><i> </i>to say what
    could be said on behalf of Ms. Walker. If she could not find anything to say in
    favour of Ms. Walker, then her obligation was to say nothing that could
    undermine Ms. Walker’s interests. If <em>amicus</em> could not carry out her
    role, she ought to have so advised the hearing judge and asked to be relieved
    of her role. In the end, Ms. Walker was in a worse position in the context of
    closing submissions than if <em>amicus</em><i> </i>had not been appointed at
    all. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Whether the Crown had an overwhelming case or not is not the issue.
    Crown counsel was present in the courtroom. Her role was to advance the Crown’s
    position. She did not need help in that regard. The hearing judge did not
    require assistance in understanding the Crown’s position. Yet, in the absence
    of the accused, in the end, the hearing became a place that looked like there
    were two Crown counsel in the courtroom. That was unfair. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While the appellant raises other issues, including a suggestion that
    the hearing judge failed to properly consider the imposition of a determinate
    sentence, in light of my conclusions already reached, I need not address those
    other issues. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Section 759 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>regulates appeals
    under Part XXIV of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, the part pertaining to dangerous
    offenders. The powers of review have been described as being “somewhat more
    robust” than those found under Part XXI of the <em>Code</em><i>, </i>dealing
    with regular routes of appeal in indictable matters: <em>Boutilier</em><i>, </i>at
    para. 81; <em>R. v. Sipos</em><i>, </i>2014 SCC 47, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 423, at

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent maintains that, even if there was a fairness or
    appearance of fairness problem in this case, the appeal should be dismissed
    because the evidence of Ms. Walker’s dangerousness was overwhelming and the
    conclusions reached by the hearing judge were inevitable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In rare circumstances, an appeal from a dangerous offender finding
    or imposition of an indeterminate sentence may be dismissed on the basis that
    there is no reasonable possibility that the result would have been any
    different had no error of law been made: <em>Boutilier</em>, at para. 82; <em>R.
    v. Johnson</em><i>, </i>2003 SCC 46, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357,<i> </i>at para. 49;
    and<i> <em>R. v. Bedard</em></i>, 2009 ONCA 678, 247 C.C.C. (3d) 275, at para.
    103. This case is not predicated on an error of law. Rather, it is predicated
    on unfairness arising from a cumulative number of procedural deficiencies,
    including on matters as fundamental as whether the appellant was fit during the
    hearing. That unfairness resulted in a miscarriage of justice that cannot be
    solved by the application of the curative proviso. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The fairness of our justice system is most on display when the
    vulnerable are caught in its grip. While difficulties will sometimes arise
    where an individual’s mental, behavioural and/or cognitive conditions interfere
    with the regular processes of the justice system, the justice system must
    respond to those difficulties in a procedurally fair manner. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For everyone involved this was an intensely difficult case, the
    likes of which are not frequently seen in our court system. Even so, Ms. Walker
    was as entitled to a procedurally fair hearing as anyone else. She did not
    receive one. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Ms. Walker asks that the dangerous offender finding and
    indeterminate sentence be set aside and a new hearing ordered. For the reasons
    given, I would allow the appeal and grant that remedy. </span></p>
