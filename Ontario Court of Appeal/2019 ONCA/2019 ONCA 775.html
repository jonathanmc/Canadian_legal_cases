  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Loujack Café was convicted of the first degree
    murder of George Washington Burnett, contrary to s. 235(1) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. He
    appeals his conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and Mr. Burnett were neighbours
    and acquaintances. One afternoon, the appellant let himself into Mr. Burnett’s
    home and viciously attacked him with knives and a blunt object (possibly a rock
    or brick). The appellant disposed of his shoes and clothes in a dumpster. He
    subsequently sent text messages to friends in which he boasted about the
    killing. He wrote incriminatory rap lyrics and posted photographs of the crime
    scene on his Facebook page. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s online activity caused the
    police to link him to Mr. Burnett’s murder. The appellant eventually provided a
    full confession. He said that he killed Mr. Burnett in order to mock or insult
    God. In his trial testimony the appellant again admitted the killing, but this
    time blamed it on obedience to voices in his head.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sole issue at trial was whether the murder
    was planned and deliberate. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
    his instructions on the elements of second degree and first degree murder. He
    further argues that the trial judge erred in his instructions on the
    appellant’s after-the-fact conduct. The following reasons explain why I would
    dismiss the appeal. </span></p>

  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To provide a proper framework for the discussion
    of the issues on appeal, it is necessary to provide further detail about some
    of the evidence adduced at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Burnett lived in a house in Hamilton,
    Ontario. The appellant lived in a rooming house directly behind Mr. Burnett’s
    home. Mr. Burnett was 82 years old. His health was in decline. He converted his
    dining room into a bedroom in order to avoid using the stairs. Mr. Burnett was
    a religious man who often sat on his porch and engaged passers-by in conversation.
    He and the appellant had conversations about religion. On Sunday, September 4,
    2011 Mr. Burnett went to church and then returned home. He was found dead in
    his house two days later.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Burnett suffered 46 knife wounds, three
    fractured ribs, as well as three blunt force injuries to his head that were
    consistent with being struck by a brick or a rock. A large knife was found near
    the fold of his neck. A second bloody knife was found on the kitchen counter
    just above the cutlery drawers. This knife was broken. There were bloody
    footprints on the kitchen floor and along the hallway to the front door, from
    which the perpetrator left the house.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When Mr. Burnett’s body was discovered, the
    appellant was among the people watching outside. The police took the
    appellant’s name for follow-up. However, the appellant proved elusive. He did
    not cooperate with police efforts to follow up with him, even though an
    officer, Detective Easto of the Hamilton Police Service, left a business card
    for him at his residence. In late November of 2011, during an unrelated police
    investigation, another police officer came across one of the appellant’s
    Facebook pages. He had posted a photo of Det. Easto’s business card with the
    caption: “The coroners and homicide be asking me questions now…no witnesses no
    fingerprints no evidence…unsolved murder cases.” </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police soon found the appellant. He agreed
    to an interview, which occurred on December 1, 2011. He denied involvement in
    the murder. He was released, but was arrested the following month, at which
    time he confessed. The appellant’s statements are discussed below.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After their initial interview with the appellant,
    the police discovered more incriminatory Facebook posts, including photographs
    and rap lyrics related to devils, demons, the demise of God, and the homicide.
    Among the photographs were images of the deceased, taken before the police had
    arrived on the scene. There was a photo of the soles of the appellant’s shoes,
    a photo of the appellant posing, with a smile, at the rear of Mr. Burnett’s
    home (after the murder), and another of a glove over a figure (presumably Mr.
    Burnett) with the caption “meet the Beast, the new God”. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 27, 2012, the appellant was arrested.
    He had several papers in his pockets which contained handwritten rap lyrics.
    Some of the lyrics seemed to relate to the murder, including the line: “Red,
    red, red rum, why’s my hands covered in dead man’s blood.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the weeks after the murder of Mr. Burnett,
    the appellant sent text messages to friends in which he claimed responsibility
    for the murder and boasted about it. On September 15, 2011 he sent the
    following texts:</span></p>

  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 12, 2012 the appellant wrote (but did
    not send) a “kite” letter (i.e., a contraband letter between inmates) to his
    friend, Mwanza, asking him to lie to the appellant’s lawyer. In the letter, the
    appellant said that Mwanza was his alibi. He told Mwanza to say that they saw
    two “Zoba mountalay’s” (i.e., two stupid white people) run out of the back of
    “the old man’s crib” and then gave “their bricks to us then they made a right
    out of sight.” Mwanza was also asked to say that the appellant went inside to
    look in “on the old man”, was in his home for 30 seconds, and then came out to
    report that Mr. Burnett was watching television.</span></p>

    girlfriend, Isabelle Roy, and asked her to lie in court by saying that “the
    beast” was the appellant’s drug dealer. At trial the appellant testified that
    “the beast” was one of the voices that he heard.</span></p>

  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span

    started, the appellant sent a letter to the trial judge. The appellant
    explained that, although he told police officers he heard voices, he in fact
    did not hear voices. He attributed his misstep to the “Detective’s 5 hours of
    mental abuse.” At trial, the appellant testified that he heard voices; indeed,
    they commanded him to kill Mr. Burnett.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant gave his first statement on
    December 1, 2011. He denied any involvement in Mr. Burnett’s killing. However,
    he said that Mr. Burnett was a religious man. The appellant suggested that the
    murder was committed by white supremacists.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the day of his arrest, January 27, 2012, the
    appellant provided a second statement. It was a full confession. The appellant
    told the police that he heard voices every day. He started hearing voices after
    a head injury a few years earlier. The voices made fun of him, challenged him,
    and called him small and “insufficient”. One voice proclaimed itself to be God.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant told the police: “[Y]es, I did
    murder George Washington Burnett. Yeah, that’s not a lie. I’ll confess it to
    you.” He killed Mr. Burnett “out of anger towards God … because he [Mr.
    Burnett] said he was a man of God right, he was a church man”. When he saw that

    appellant said that he took a knife and got two knives from Mr. Burnett’s
    kitchen. The appellant then described how and where he stabbed Mr. Burnett;
    this description was largely consistent with the state in which Mr. Burnett was
    found. The appellant said that he took a photo of Mr. Burnett “to mock God …

    something in a plastic bag”. The appellant said that he stabbed Mr. Burnett in
    the neck and he got up. He then swung the bag with a rock in it and hit Mr.
    Burnett in the head. Because his knife broke, the appellant retrieved two
    knives from the kitchen and went back to continue the attack. He said, “I

    entering Mr. Burnett’s house, asking, “[J]ust to hurt him?” The appellant confirmed,
    “It was just to hurt him.” Finally, when asked about how he felt after he had

    religious conversations in the past. He attributed his attack on Mr. Burnett to
    voices in his head. The appellant said that Mr. Burnett had left his door open.
    The appellant snuck inside and saw Mr. Burnett lying on his bed. The voices
    told him, “Kill him or die now”. During the attack, the voices continued and
    said: “Stop fuckin’ around; kill him or, or die”. The voices also instructed
    him to do other things, including: taking photographs of the deceased; closing
    the back door and leaving through the front door; disposing of his clothes and
    shoes in a dumpster; writing the kite letter to Mr. Mwanza; and taking a selfie
    with Det. Easto’s business card and posting it online. The voices also told him
    that he was the chosen one, who was above the law, and that the voices were
    protecting him. In short, the appellant admitted to everything contained in his
    confession, except those aspects that pointed to planning and deliberation,
    such as bringing his own gloves, knife, and a rock or brick in a bag.</span></p>

    that the trial judge’s error in relation to s. 229(a)(ii) required a new trial.
    However, this position changed by the time of the oral hearing of the appeal.
    No longer was it alleged to be fatal. Instead, it was argued that the flawed
    explanation of s. 229(a)(ii) had a serious impact on the appellant’s liability
    for first degree murder, based on a theory of the case that was not relied upon
    by either party at trial.</span></p>

    appellant’s testimony and downplayed his January 27, 2012 statement, which evidenced
    planning and deliberation. He submitted that the appellant’s version at trial
    pointed to a murder that was spontaneous, not planned and deliberate. The
    defence emphasized that the appellant was following voice commands when he
    killed Mr. Burnett; he was not attempting to mock God, as the appellant had
    said in his statement to police. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In its closing address, the Crown relied on the
    appellant’s January 27, 2012 statement in which he said that, having noticed
    Mr. Burnett’s door was open, he went home to make certain preparations. The
    appellant then returned to Mr. Burnett’s home to carry out his plan to “take
    advantage of”, “finish”, or “hurt” Mr. Burnett, in order to mock God. The Crown
    said, “The elements of planning and deliberation are, in this case, pre-arming
    himself, suiting up back in his apartment, wearing gloves, and entering the
    house with the pre-existing intention to kill. This is all evidence of a simple
    plan.”</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Essentially, the dispute at trial came down to
    the following: if the appellant formed his plan to attack Mr. Burnett in his
    apartment before entering Mr. Burnett’s home, he would be guilty of first
    degree murder; if the jury had a doubt about this part of the narrative, and
    concluded that the appellant formed an intention to hurt Mr. Burnett only after
    he entered his home, the appellant would be guilty of second degree murder. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the first time on appeal, the appellant
    argues that some of the utterances from the appellant’s January 27, 2012
    statement (reproduced in paras. 22-23, above) suggest that, when he was in his
    room, the appellant may only have planned to hurt Mr. Burnett, not to kill him.
    Based on this new theory, the appellant contends that the trial judge’s
    instructions on s. 229(a)(ii) were flawed in a way that led to an erroneous guilty
    verdict on first degree murder. Moreover, the appellant now argues that his
    statement – “I didn’t go in there to assault him, I went in there with the mind
    to, you know, finish him” – was ambiguous. The appellant submits that the jury
    could have understood the words “go in there”, not to mean entering Mr.
    Burnett’s house, but as a reference to the appellant’s state of mind when he
    went into Mr. Burnett’s kitchen to retrieve knives. The appellant submits that
    this brief plan was incapable of amounting to planning and deliberation. I
    would reject both arguments. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Now, I’m going to talk about the elements of

    guilty of murder, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: Mr. Café

    to death. <u>It is implicit in his evidence that he meant to kill him</u> and that

  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The circumstances of this case made the

    alone. The identity of the killer was beyond dispute. The trial judge’s words –
    “The requisite state of mind is either, intent to kill, or intent to cause
    serious bodily harm that one knows is likely to cause death” – could only have
    been interpreted as referring to the appellant’s state of mind, both in terms
    of the intent to kill or cause serious bodily harm, as well as knowledge that
    the serious bodily harm was likely to cause death. Thus the jury was clearly
    instructed that liability for second degree murder is subjective.</span></p>

    had been erroneous, s. 229(a)(ii) was not realistically in play. The evidence
    at trial established beyond all doubt that the appellant intended to kill Mr.
    Burnett. All counsel and the trial judge proceeded on the basis that the
    killing was intentional and that, if believed, the appellant’s January 27, 2012
    statement pointed to a plan to kill; his evidence at trial suggested a killing
    that was spontaneous and inspired by voice commands – but intentional
    nonetheless. In his closing address, defence counsel stated that “the intent to
    kill is clearly evident and proven”. He repeatedly acknowledged this point. And
    although he complained that the trial judge’s charge was “rapid”, defence
    counsel did not object to the trial judge’s instructions on second degree
    murder. This was undoubtedly due to the fact that the requisite intent for
    second degree murder was satisfied under s. 229(a)(i), and s. 229(a)(ii) was
    not at issue.   </span></p>

    re-instructed the jury and reminded them to consider all of the things said by
    the appellant on January 27, 2012, including: “I wanted to go take advantage of
    him”; “I wanted to hurt him … because he was a man of God, and God is, uh, has
    been causin’ me trouble.”</span></p>

    utterance “I went in there to finish him” be placed in its proper context was
    appropriate, and the trial judge was right to provide further instructions.
    However, it was not incumbent upon the trial judge to go further and instruct
    the jury that it was precluded from finding the appellant guilty of first
    degree murder on the basis of the “finish him” utterance alone. It was for the
    jury to draw inferences from the evidence as a whole: see </span><em><span

    para. 100. It was not the trial judge’s role to foreclose lines of reasoning
    the appellant found unfavourable to his position. Moreover, the jury would not
    have thought that it could convict the appellant of first degree murder based
    on a plan to kill formed at the time the appellant fetched knives from the
    kitchen, moments before the attack was completed. As noted in para. 30 above,
    the Crown’s theory of first degree murder rested on a plan to kill Mr. Burnett
    that was conceived before the appellant entered his house. This was also the
    understanding of the defence and the trial judge.</span></span></p>

    new argument raised on appeal, there is no merit in the appellant’s submission
    that he may have been convicted of first degree murder based on a plan to
    merely hurt Mr. Burnett. As discussed above, it was common ground at trial that
    the January 27, 2012 statement pointed to an intent to <u>kill</u>. Defence
    counsel submitted that the decision to kill was spontaneous because it had just
    been commanded by the voices. Liability for first degree murder predicated on a
    s. 229(a)(ii) killing was not a live issue. It is clear that the appellant was
    found guilty of first degree murder because the jury was satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellant went into Mr. Burnett’s house with the
    intention of killing him. Had the trial judge also outlined a route to first
    degree murder based on s. 229(a)(ii), it would have had the effect of
    expanding, not narrowing, the appellant’s liability exposure for first degree
    murder.</span></span></p>

    probative of whether the appellant committed the offence: the kite letter; the
    appellant’s disposal of his clothing and the rock (if there was one); and his
    discussion with Ms. Roy about the “beast”. However, the trial judge held that
    the photographs that the appellant posted on his Facebook page, as well as his
    texts about the murder, some of which purported to mock God, were relevant to
    planning and deliberation. As the trial judge stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As in <i>Aravena</i>, they could show that the
    accused did what he intended to do. They could show that he was telling the
    truth when he told the police that his motive was to mock or insult God, as
    opposed to obeying God, which could be relevant on the question of whether he
    chose Mr. Burnett for a particular purpose ahead of time and therefore planned
    and deliberated on his murder. It is only relevant on that basis, and I think
    the jury will also have to be told that carefully, that that’s the only way

    was tailored to the manner in which the evidence unfolded at trial,
    particularly how the appellant’s testimony differed from his January 27, 2012
    statement to the police. The posts and text messages, in which the appellant
    seemed pleased with himself and bragged about the killing, were capable of
    being evidence of motive. It was open to the jury to conclude that the evidence
    was more consistent with the appellant’s statement (i.e., the killing was to
    insult God) than his trial testimony (i.e., the appellant was obeying voice
    commands). The evidence was consistent with someone who had achieved the goal
    to which he had aspired by singling out Mr. Burnett for the purpose of mocking
    God. As a matter of logic and common sense, the appellant’s conduct was
    relevant to whether the murder was planned and deliberate: </span><em><span

    temporally from the event to which it is said to relate.” The probative value
    of the conduct derives from the logical inferences that may be drawn when

    (emphasis in original). With after-the-fact conduct evidence, the jury must be
    told to take into account alternative explanations for the conduct to avoid
    mistaken or premature inferences of guilt: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>McGregor</span></em><span

    counsel for the appellant advised that an ineffective assistance of counsel
    claim would not be made, largely because, even if the missed opportunity to
    pursue the s. 16 issue at trial was due to a lack of competence, it was highly
    unlikely that evidence would have been available to substantiate the NCRMD
