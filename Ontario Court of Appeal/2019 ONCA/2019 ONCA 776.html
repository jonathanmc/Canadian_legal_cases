  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Simmons J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>introduction</span></h1>

    times before, on June 28, 2011, 15-year-old S.K. (the appellant) took his father's
    Dodge Caravan minivan out at night without his parents consent and went joyriding
    with three friends. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Garrett Styles of York Regional Police stopped the appellant for speeding. Following
    a brief trip to his cruiser, Constables Styles told the appellant that the van
    would be impounded and ordered him to get out of the vehicle. The appellant
    refused and pleaded with the officer to let him go.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>After some further verbal
    interaction with the appellant, Constable Styles opened the drivers door of
    the van, reached over the appellant and attempted to undo the appellant's seat
    belt. The van then started moving onto Highway 48 and accelerated with
    Constable Styles caught between the appellant and the steering wheel and the
    lower part of his body hanging out the open drivers door. </span></p>

    metres down the highway, Constable Styles jerked the steering wheel to the
    left. The van left the highway, went through a ditch and up an embankment,
    became airborne, and rolled 360 degrees. Constable Styles was ejected from the
    van, which ultimately came to rest on top of him. Although he was conscious
    when emergency personnel arrived, tragically, Constable Styles was pronounced
    dead shortly after reaching the hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    a spinal fracture in the crash that rendered him a quadriplegic. He was charged
    with first degree murder at 6:15 a.m. on the morning of June 28, 2011. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    28, S.K. underwent spinal surgery, following which he was intubated and unable
    to speak for three weeks. During that period, he could only use an alphabet
    board to communicate. On July 24, 2011, S.K. made a statement to his father,
    N.K., to the effect that he did not intentionally set the van in motion.</span></p>

    the appellant committed a dangerous act (dangerous driving) for an unlawful
    object (obstructing a police officer, stealing his parents van, and possession
    of stolen property) knowing that his dangerous actions were likely to cause
    Constable Styless death. At trial, the Crown theorized that the appellant put
    the van in park when he was initially stopped but later, when Constable Styles
    attempted to remove him from the vehicle, intentionally shifted into drive and
    stepped on the accelerator. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    at trial and claimed he kept his foot on the brake pedal throughout the traffic
    stop and never shifted into park. Constable Styles startled him when he
    suddenly opened the door and then lunged into the vehicle. The appellant said he
    was trying to push the brakes, he did not intentionally push the accelerator
    pedal, he could not breathe with Constable Styles on top of him, and he had no
    control over the vehicle as it accelerated onto the highway. To support the
    appellants claim, the defence called a biomechanical engineer to explain the
    phenomenon of pedal misapplication, a form of unintended acceleration. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>However, a paramedic
    who attended to the appellant at the scene of the crash testified that, when he
    was asked what happened, the appellant said he could not specifically recall
    the accident and that the appellant never provided any information about events
    leading up to the accident. Although the Crown did not cross-examine the
    appellant about this statement, in closing submissions, the Crown questioned
    why the appellants first response to the paramedic had not been to the effect that
    he was trying to stop the van.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As part of the defence case, the appellant
    applied to admit evidence of his statement to his father both for the truth of
    its contents and for the fact that it had been made on several </span><span

    the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>; the recent fabrication exception; the
    narrative exception; and the trial judges residual discretion. The trial judge
    refused the appellants request. The trial judge also refused the appellants
    request for a mistrial arising from the Crowns closing address and instead provided
    a corrective instruction.</span></p>

    Once off-road, the van travelled across uneven terrain that would have made it

    Hebert calculated that the van would have been travelling at 58.6 km/h, plus or

    presses on the accelerator either because of initially hitting the wrong pedal
    or because the drivers foot slips off the brakes and unintentionally slides on

    shoot the appellant, bit him, and steered a van full of people off the road,
    the trial Crown said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[C]learly those are the acts of someone who
    believed if he did not do something drastic, something dramatic, someone would

    trial and as [defence counsel] reminded you, [the appellant] was asked this
    question and gave this answer: Question: And you knew as you drove up Highway
    48 that if Constable Styles fell out of the van he was likely going to end up
    dead, you knew that, right? His answer: That never crossed my mind. And I
    say to you dont believe that. Not only did it cross his mind, but he knew when

    acknowledged that 15-year-olds do not necessarily think through their actions,

    knowledge to both Constable Styles knowledge and that which anyone would
    know:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Just like Constable Styles knew that this was

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Knowledge and the likely consequence of the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It would have been obvious to anyone,

    para. 25.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Watt J.A. explained in <i>R. v. M.C.</i>, 2014 ONCA 611, 314 C.C.C.
    (3d) 336, at para. 59, prior consistent statements are an amalgam of two
    elements  a hearsay element (<i>i.e.</i>, the contents of the statement) and a
    declaration element (<i>i.e</i>., the fact that the statement was made): see
    also David M. Paciocco, The Perils and Potential of Prior Consistent
    Statements: Let's Get it Right (2013) 17 Can. Crim. L. Rev. 181, at p. 184. The
    hearsay rule takes care of the hearsay element. The prior consistent statement
    rule generally excludes the declaration element. The rationale for excluding
    the declaration element is that prior consistent statements lack probative
    value: <i>Stirling</i>, at para. 5.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the common law has recognized a number of exceptions to
    the general prohibition against prior consistent statements. Where a prior
    consistent statement is admissible under an exception, it is generally admitted
    for a limited purpose:<i> Khan</i>, at para. 27. Sometimes the hearsay part
    comes in and at other times only the declaration part is admitted: <i>M.C.</i>,
    at para. 61. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The exceptions to the prior consistent statement rule tend to
    exist where the purposes that underpin the general exclusionary rule would not
    be served by excluding the evidence: <i>M.C.</i>, at para. 60; Paciocco, at p.
    187. Typically, the exceptions permit introduction of the prior consistent
    statement where proof of it is relevant without an inference of credibility
    enhancement because the witness said the same thing previously: <i>M.C.</i>, at
    para. 60; <i>R. v. Toten</i> (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 225, at pp. 255-56. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In a jury trial, where a prior consistent statement is admitted,
    the trial judge is required to instruct the jury on the purposes for which a

    appellants statement to his father on the ground, initially, that the
    statement was a spontaneous utterance made when the appellant was first taxed
    with the facts and was therefore admissible under the <i>Edgar</i> exception.
    By agreement of counsel, the issue was addressed after the Crown had completed
    his cross-examination of the appellant on the understanding that examination-in-chief
    and cross-examination would be re-opened if the statement was ruled admissible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following <i>voir dires</i> at which the
    appellants father, mother, and Dr. Van Ee testified, the appellant advanced
    several more grounds for the admission of the statement both for the truth of
    its content and for the fact that the statement was made. The appellant alleged
    that the Crown had at least implicitly suggested that he had recently
    fabricated his evidence to closely parallel Dr. Van Ees. A focus of the new
    arguments advanced by the appellant for admission of his prior statement to his
    father was to respond to this suggestion. Ultimately, the trial judge ruled the
    statement inadmissible for reasons to follow. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence then sought to have the appellant
    testify that he had disclosed his version of events to his father without
    revealing the content of his statement so the jury would know, simply, that he
    had given an early account of the events. The trial judge dismissed this
    application. He noted that the statement had been ruled inadmissible and he did
    not want the jury to speculate about what was said or whether it was important.</span></p>

    application to admit the fact of a statement having been made as a narrative
    exception to the rule against hearsay. The trial judge again dismissed the
    application. The defence then asked to be permitted to refresh the appellants
    memory of the events by showing him what he had told his father. Again, the
    purpose of the request was to make the jury aware the appellant had given a
    prior account of the events.</span></p>

    in which the Crown asked the jury to think about what the appellant did not say
    to the paramedic who attended to the appellant at the scene. The Crown suggested
    the first thing the appellant would have said, when asked what happened, was that
    he tried to stop the van, if this was indeed the truth.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both the trial judge and the defence were
    concerned about the propriety of these comments. The defence initially
    requested that the case be re-opened and evidence of the appellants statement to
    his father be admitted as a response. However, the defence did not pursue that
    request and instead brought an application for a mistrial. </span></p>

    submissions to assess the appellants reliability or credibility with respect
    to the defence of pedal misapplication. </span><span lang=EN-CA>While the trial
    judge did not mention the case of <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.),
    he did find that the trial Crown should have given the appellant an opportunity
    during cross-examination to explain why he had not given a fuller account to
    the paramedic. </span><span lang=EN-CA>However, as outlined in para. 63 above,
    rather than prohibit the jury from relying on the Crowns submissions relating

    communicate in the 26-day period between the accident and the appellants
    statement. In any event the trial judge concluded that whether one is
    recovering from serious injury or not, [the 26-day period] may well have
    provided [the appellant] opportunity  to think things out. Because of this
    delay, the statement did not qualify as spontaneous.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also held that multiple
    frailties surrounding the circumstances under which the statement was made
    negated the necessary circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to make the
    statement admissible either as a spontaneous statement or under the principled
    approach outlined in <i>R. v. Khelawon</i>, 2006 SCC 57, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 787.
    These frailties included the fact that the statement was not recorded in any
    fashion, his father had no notes of the conversation, his father acknowledged
    that he recalled only 70 to 80 per cent of the conversation, and while the
    appellants father claimed he was the only person present when the statement
    was made, the appellants mother testified that she, too, was present when the
    appellant provided details about the incident. </span></p>

    ONCA 248, 115 O.R. (3d) 363, at paras. 42-44, leave to appeal refused, [2014]
    S.C.C.A. No. 35, for the principle that cross-examination directed merely at

    appellants argument that admitting the statement was necessary to negative any
    conclusions or inferences of recent fabrication that may be drawn by the jury.
    However, he said, [i]f required, a clear and focused direction to the jury not
    to find recent fabrication will be given.</span></p>

    Discharge Summary were included in the material filed on the <i>Edgar</i> application at trial. In particular, the Discharge Summary noted his

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While there is some elasticity in the case law
    concerning how proximate in time to an accusation an accuseds reaction must be
    to qualify as spontaneous, the approximately 26 days involved in this case
    simply cannot meet that requirement. The appellant was initially charged with
    first degree murder at 6:15 a.m. on the morning of July 28, 2011. There was
    evidence that he had some communication with his parents by alphabet board in
    the ensuing 26 days and that he was visited on two occasions by a lawyer hired
    by his father. In my view, the trial judges finding that he had had time to think

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, I see no error in the trial judges
    finding that the appellants statement lacked the necessary circumstantial
    guarantees of trustworthiness to support its admission under the principled
    exception to the hearsay rule. As the trial judge noted, the statement was not
    recorded in any fashion. The appellants father had no contemporaneous notes,
    he gave his first account of the statement at the preliminary inquiry held in June
    2012, the circumstances under which the statement was made were not entirely
    clear, and the appellants father did not claim a complete recall of the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also agree with the trial judge that the lack

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, the statement did not possess
    circumstantial indicia of truthfulness that would allow its admission under the
    narrative as circumstantial evidence exception to the prohibition against
    admission of prior consistent statements. Moreover, the statement was not being
    tendered as true narrative  that is, as background information to assist the
    witness in recounting events in a comprehensible manner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, however, one aspect of the Crowns
    cross-examination was at least on the periphery of raising recent fabrication. As
    noted at para. 52 above, at one stage of the appellants cross-examination, the
    Crown made the following suggestion:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. You see, sir, Im going to suggest to you the <u>only reason</u> you say I was startled. I was surprised that he opened the
    door is because <u>youre trying to provide some explanation</u> as to why, in
    this startle and surprise, you hit the gas pedal unintentionally, thats why
    youre saying you were startled and surprised, right? [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown asserts that this suggestion was
    entirely consistent with the Crowns overall theory that the appellant was
    fabricating his evidence from the outset as a means of escaping liability. That
    may be one interpretation of this suggestion. In that regard, I note that, in
    his post-verdict reasons for excluding the appellants statement, the trial
    judge gave no explanation for finding the Crown had not alleged recent
    fabrication, either expressly or implicitly. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the Crowns suggestion should be viewed
    in the context of the entire trial, at which the appellants expert proposed to
    explain that phase one of the phenomenon of pedal misapplication tends to arise
    in circumstances where the driver is distracted or startled. As a result, the
    Crowns suggestion can also be viewed as at least an implicit suggestion that
    the appellant was tailoring his evidence to correspond with his experts
    proposed evidence  a classic example of an allegation of recent fabrication. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This interpretation of the Crowns suggestion
    becomes even stronger when viewed in the context of the Crowns closing address
    in which the Crown invited the jury to consider what the appellant had not said
    when asked by the paramedic about what had happened. The Crown explained the
    appellant had not said he was trying to hit the brakes. In other words, the
    Crown invited the jury to disbelieve the appellant because he had not made a
    statement at the earliest opportunity in response to a question about what had
    happened that was consistent with his evidence at trial. Put another way, the
    appellant had not made a prior consistent statement  or proclaimed his
    innocence  at the earliest opportunity. This carried with it at least the
    implicit suggestion that the appellant had fabricated his evidence at some time
    after the events  and, in the context of the experts evidence, that he had
    done so in a way that would correspond with the experts evidence. </span></p>

    statement sought to be adduced must not only respond to an allegation of recent
    fabrication, whether express or implied, and be made after the event being
    testified about (and before the alleged recent fabrication), but it must also
    be consistent with the testimony it is offered to support: David M. Paciocco

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the appellants father said the
    appellant spoke of panic and freeze. Although the terms may not be identical,
    in my view, the feelings they describe are sufficiently similar to be capable
    of rebutting the implicit allegation that the appellants evidence of feeling
    startled and surprised was recently fabricated so as to support the theory of
    pedal misapplication. To conclude otherwise would, in all the circumstances, be
    splitting hairs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, although the appellant did not
    specifically tell his father that he was pushing the brakes, he did tell his
    father that he never intended to drive and did not think he did anything to
    make the vehicle move. In my view, these concepts  <i>i.e.</i>,<i> </i>not intentionally
    making the vehicle move and pushing the brakes  are sufficiently connected
    to be capable of rebutting the Crowns implicit allegation that the appellants
    evidence about pedal misapplication was recently fabricated. Again, to conclude
    otherwise would be to consider the Crowns comments too narrowly. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Considered in the context of the overall
    circumstances of the trial, in my view, the appellants statement to his father
    should have been admitted to respond to an implicit allegation of recent
    fabrication and to provide overall context for the jury about what the
    appellant had said close in time to the incident  and prior to obtaining an
    experts report on pedal misapplication. Moreover, neither the evidence nor the
    jury instructions would have unduly lengthened or complicated the trial. Jury
    instructions cautioning against misuse of prior consistent statements are
    simple and easy to understand. With the assistance of counsel, it would not
    have been difficult to craft an instruction concerning the permissible use of
    the appellants statement to his father. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judges jury instructions
    concerning the Crowns closing address was inadequate. However, I reject the
    appellants submission that the trial judge erred in failing to declare a
    mistrial following the Crowns comments in his closing address questioning the
    appellants failure to tell the paramedic who attended to him that he tried to
    stop the van. A mistrial is a discretionary remedy of last resort: <i>R. v. A.G.</i>,
    2015 ONCA 159, 124 O.R. (3d) 758, at paras. 50-52. Had the trial judge
    instructed the jury not to use the Crowns closing submissions in assessing the
    appellants credibility on pedal misapplication as he originally proposed, in
    my view, that would have been adequate to remedy the prejudice flowing from the
    comments in the Crowns closing address. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the Crown argues there was no
    violation of the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> because the appellant testified
    in examination-in-chief that he did not recognize the paramedic and did not
    really recall their conversation. This was because he was in a lot of pain and
    terrified as he could not move his legs or his arms following the crash. There
    was nothing contradictory to put to the appellant in the circumstances. In any
    event, even if there was a <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> violation, the Crown submits
    the trial judges instruction went further than required, by effectively
    instructing the jury not to factor in Crown counsels point in his closing address
    in assessing the appellants credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept the Crowns submission. Whether or
    not there was a violation of the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i>, the real
    problem with the Crowns closing address is that, at least implicitly, it
    invited the jury to infer that the appellant fabricated his evidence <i>after</i> the accident and <i>in order to</i> correspond with his experts evidence about
    pedal misapplication. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Particularly given that he declined to admit the
    appellants statement to his father, the trial judge should not have left it to
    the jury to decide whether to use [the appellants] nondisclosure of pedal
    misapplication and unintended acceleration to [the paramedic], in order to
    impeach [the appellant]s credibility. Rather, he should have instructed them in
    strong terms that it would be prejudicial and unfair to the appellant for them
    to do so. </span></p>

    reviewed the use the jury could make of the appellants out-of-court statements,
    including those made immediately before, during, and after the traffic stop. In
    doing so, the trial judge alerted the jury to the factual questions of who first
    raised the subject of fleeing when Constable Styles returned briefly to his
    cruiser and how B.D. knew about the brass knuckles. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In their trial testimony, F.D. and B.P. both
    denied that F.D. said anything about the brass knuckles or that he encouraged
    the appellant to leave the scene. However, B.D. had advised police about the
    brass knuckles in her statement to the police. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge told the jury it was for them to
    determine how B.D. knew about the brass knuckles and that they may conclude
    that both F.D. and B.P. were untruthful and lied about this issue. He also told
    the jury that a deliberate lie under oath is always serious and may taint a
    witnesss entire testimony. However, he left it to the jury to decide whether
    the two had deliberately lied and, if they had, to what extent, if any, the
    remainder of their evidence [was] tainted.</span></p>

    counsel objected that the trial judge failed to remind the jury that in his
    closing address, Crown counsel had acknowledged that F.D. and B.P. could not
    explain how B.D. knew about the brass knuckles. On appeal, the appellant
    submits that the trial judge should have told the jury that there was no doubt that
    F.D. and B.P. had lied. Further, he should have told them to consider the fact
    of their lying not only in the context of the remainder of their evidence but
    also specifically in the context of their claims that it was the appellant who
    first raised the idea of fleeing and their evidence that the appellant asked
    repeatedly, Should I dip?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reject the appellants argument that the trial
    judge made any error in this aspect of his instructions. The jury was the trier
    of fact; the trial judge accurately reviewed the evidence concerning the issue
    of whether F.D. and B.P. had lied and gave the jury proper instructions on how
    to assess the significance of a lie. As I have said, the trial judge gave these
    instructions in the context of explaining to the jury the use they could make
    of the appellants out-of-court statements and alerting them to the factual
    questions of who first raised the subject of fleeing and how B.D. knew about
    the brass knuckles. It could not have been lost on the jury that if they were
    satisfied F.D. and B.P. had lied, they should consider the impact of the lies
    on the question of who first raised the subject of fleeing.</span></p>

    unreasonable?</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the preliminary inquiry, the
    preliminary inquiry judge discharged the appellant on the first degree murder
    charge, but committed him for trial on the lesser offence of manslaughter. On a <i>certiorari</i> application, a Superior Court judge quashed the discharge on
    first degree murder and committal for manslaughter. She remitted the matter to
    the preliminary inquiry judge with a direction that the appellant be committed
    for trial for first degree murder under ss. 229(a)(ii) and 229(c) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>. This court subsequently upheld that ruling: <i>R. v. S.K.</i>, 2014
    ONCA 138.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the close of the Crowns case, the defence
    applied for a directed verdict, arguing that a properly instructed jury could
    not reasonably return a murder verdict under either subsection. The trial judge
    dismissed the defence application. At a pre-charge conference, the Crown
    requested that the trial judge leave only s. 229(c), explaining that s. 229(a)(ii)
    was a weaker basis for liability: if the Crown could not prove murder under s.
    229(c), it would not succeed under s. 229(a)(ii) either.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his factum on appeal, the appellant argues
    that the first degree murder verdict was unreasonable because there was no
    evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that,
    during the relevant time, the appellant knew that his actions were likely to
    cause Constable Styless death. The appellant testified that he did not turn
    his mind to that possibility. The three passengers evidence was consistent
    with what Dr. Van Ee called a hypervigilant state: the appellant was focused on
    controlling the steering wheel and oblivious to much of what was going on in
    the vehicle. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, the appellant submits that circumstantial
    evidence could not support a finding that the appellant knew that his actions
    were likely to cause death. That evidence indicated the appellant was holding
    onto Constables Styles firmly with his left hand and that the officer was
    gripping the interior of the vehicle with all his strength. Further, the
    evidence concerning the relatively large size of the appellant and the officer
    and the fact that the officer did not fall out even as the van traversed rough
    terrain demonstrated that the officer was firmly wedged in the space between
    the appellant and the steering wheel and not at risk of falling out in the
    ordinary course of driving down the road. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, Constable Styless death was caused
    by the rollover of the van after it was turned off the road, travelled through
    a ditch and up an embankment, and became airborne. These events were not
    predictable. The appellant submits that, applying the lens of judicial
    experience, the evidence did not establish that death was, in fact, likely 
    much less that the appellant subjectively knew it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In oral argument on appeal, the defence also
    submitted that, applying the lens of judicial experience, any inference that
    the appellant purposely left the scene and thereby intentionally committed a
    dangerous act was also speculative and unreasonable. This would make not only
    the guilty verdict on first degree murder, but also a guilty verdict on the
    included offence of manslaughter unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In support of this argument, the appellant notes
    that he testified that he did not intentionally press the gas pedal. The
    credibility of his evidence was supported on a scientific basis by the evidence
    of Dr. Van Ee. The passengers evidence concerning whether the appellant
    activated the gear shift was entirely inconsistent and therefore unreliable 
    as was their evidence as to who first suggested the idea that the appellant
    dip or leave. No physical evidence was available to support a conclusion that
    the acceleration was intentional.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not accept the appellants submissions. I
    will turn first to the impugned inference that the appellant intentionally
    committed a dangerous act. The appellants position on this issue at trial
    rested wholly on the appellants credibility. Although it is true that Dr. Van
    Ees evidence provided a scientific basis for the appellants explanation of
    what happened, Dr. Van Ee acknowledged that he was not in a position to opine
    on what actually happened. Despite his evidence, it remained open for the jury
    to reject the appellants claim that he did not intentionally set the van in
    motion. There were many reasons why the jury might do so. Among others, the
    appellant gave a false name to Constable Styles, which was the second time he
    had given a false name to a police officer after being stopped while driving;
    he deceived his parents by teaching himself to drive; he deceived his parents
    by repeatedly taking a car out at night without their permission as an unlicenced
    driver and persisted in doing so even after being caught; and he expressed
    significant concern over what his parents reaction might be if they found out
    he had resumed driving. Particularly having regard to these factors and their
    potential impact on credibility, it was clearly open to the jury to reject the
    appellants evidence and conclude that he had intentionally set the van in
    motion. The fact that there was another available inference did not preclude
    the jury from determining based on the whole of the evidence that it was not a
    reasonable inference. In the result, finding that the appellant intentionally
    set the van in motion was not unreasonable.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I now turn to the reasonableness of the finding
    that the appellant knew his dangerous act was likely to cause officer Styless
    death. Essentially the same evidence that justified the dismissal of the
    directed verdict application, which was substantially the same evidence that
    justified committal on a charge of first degree murder, supports the
    reasonableness of that finding. That evidence includes:</span></p>

    reasonableness of the murder verdict, this evidence must now be viewed in the
    context of knowing that the jury concluded that the appellant intentionally put
    the van in motion. Thus, we have the driver of a van intentionally accelerating
    down a highway in an erratic fashion with an unbelted passenger hanging partly

    judge erred in failing to instruct the jury to consider the appellants age and
    the evidence relating to his level of maturity before applying the common sense
    inference, I would not conclude that the murder verdict was unreasonable. The
    appellant intentionally created a life-threatening situation and was persisting
    in that course of conduct despite the threats and admonitions of others in the
    van. To hold the murder verdict unreasonable would be to effectively conclude
    that 15-year-olds are incapable of appreciating the likely consequences of
    their actions. The question here was whether this 15-year-old did so. That was
    a question for the jury to decide taking account of the whole of the evidence.</span></p>

    elements of the offence. The second and third errors affect trial fairness. The
    Crowns case that the appellant committed a dangerous act knowing it was likely
    to cause the officers death cannot be characterized as overwhelming as it
    hinged on whether the appellant intentionally set the van in motion. This

    explaining why the trial judge erred in his charge by failing to identify
    factors personal to the appellant, such as his age and level of maturity, that
    were relevant to the issue of whether he knew that death was likely under s.
    229(c) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. This error is
    sufficient to allow the appeal since, as my colleague explains, it directly
    impacts one of the elements of the offence. I also agree with my colleagues
    holding that the trial judge should have given the corrective instruction that
    he originally said he would give in response to the Crowns closing address. I
    similarly share my colleagues conclusion that the trial judges treatment of
    the evidence of F.D. and B.P. was adequate and my colleagues rejection of the
    appellants unreasonable verdict argument. Likewise, I agree with her
    conclusion that the appellants statement did not meet the requirements for
    admissibility under the exception recognized in <i>R. v. Edgar</i>, 2010 ONCA 529,
    101 O.R. (3d) 161, leave to appeal refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 466, the
    principled exception to the hearsay rule, by analogy to s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, or under the narrative as circumstantial evidence exception to the
    prohibition against the admission of prior consistent statements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I disagree with my colleagues
    conclusion that Crown counsel implicitly alleged recent fabrication in a single
    passage of his cross-examination of the appellant. That passage must be
    understood in the context of the Crowns entire cross-examination of the
    appellant. This context makes clear that the jury would not have understood
    Crown counsel to have alleged recent fabrication but instead that Crown
    counsels position was that the appellant was simply lying to avoid conviction.
    Nor can Crown counsels allegation of recent fabrication in the closing address
    be used to hold that the trial judge erred in failing to admit the statement.
    The trial judge had to make his ruling on recent fabrication prior to the Crowns
    closing. Following the Crowns closing, the defence no longer sought the
    admission of the statement and argued that reopening the case to admit the
    statement would prejudice the defence. Accordingly, it is inappropriate to rely
    on the Crowns closing to hold that the trial judge erred in failing to admit
    the statement. The real issue following the Crowns closing was not the
    admissibility of the statement but the adequacy of the trial judges corrective
    instruction. As I have explained, I agree with my colleague that this
    corrective instruction was inadequate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also disagree with my colleagues conclusion
    that the trial judge should have admitted the statement to provide the jury
    with overall context about what the appellant had said close in time to the
    incident and prior to obtaining an expert report on pedal misapplication. In my
    view, the overall context basis of admission adds nothing to the recent
    fabrication basis of admission and only risks confusing the jury.</span></p>

    reasons, there are three requirements to trigger the recent fabrication
    exception. First, the statement must be consistent with the testimony it is
    offered to support. Second, the witness must have made the statement after the
    event the witness is testifying about. Third, the statement must predate the
    point in time when the opposing party claims the witness first adopted the
    version of events the witness is testifying to at trial. See David M. Paciocco &amp;
    Lee Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i>, 7th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2015),
    at p. 531.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As is apparent from the third element of this
    definition, what is critical to triggering the recent fabrication exception is
    the identification by the opposing party of a point in time that gives rise to
    a motive to fabricate. As the Supreme Court held in <i>R. v. Stirling</i>, 2008
    SCC 10, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 272,<i> </i>at para. 5, a prior consistent statement
    admitted to rebut recent fabrication has probative value because it can show
    that the witness story was the same even before a motivation to fabricate
    arose. Accordingly, as Watt J.A. held in <i>R. v. Vassel</i>, 2018 ONCA 721,
    365 C.C.C. (3d) 45, at para. 124, it is essential to every allegation of
    recent fabrication that the opposing party assert that <u>at some identifiable
    point in time</u> the witness began to make the claim being challenged
    (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To trigger the recent fabrication exception, the
    opposing partys express or apparent position must be that a witness has made
    up the false story at some point after the event the witness testified about
    occurred. An allegation of recent fabrication may be implicit as well as
    express. However, it is not enough that an implicit allegation of recent
    fabrication is simply one possible interpretation of a question asked in
    cross-examination. Instead, as the Supreme Court held in <i>Stirling</i>, at
    para. 5, what is required is that the apparent position of the opposing party
    is that a witness has recently fabricated evidence. The court must determine
    the opposing partys apparent position by analyzing the circumstances of the
    case, the evidence of the witnesses called, and the conduct of the trial: <i>R.
    v. Evans</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 629, at p. 643; <i>R. v. Campbell</i> (1977), 17
    O.R. (2d) 673 (C.A.), at p. 686. In particular, the court should consider
    whether the opposing party ever suggested to the witness a point in time when
    the witness would have decided to lie to avoid conviction: <i>Vassel</i>, at
    para. 130.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An opposing party can thus attack a witness
    credibility or reliability without triggering the recent fabrication exception
    as long as the opposing party does not allege that the witness made up the
    false story at some point after the event the witness testified about occurred.
    As the Supreme Court held in <i>R. v. Ellard</i>, 2009 SCC 27, [2009] 2 S.C.R.
    19, at para. 33, a mere contradiction in the evidence will not constitute an
    allegation of recent fabrication. Similarly, as Doherty J.A. held in <i>R. v.
    Kailayapillai</i>, 2013 ONCA 248, 115 O.R. (3d) 363, at para. 42, leave to
    appeal refused, [2014] S.C.C.A. No. 35, counsel may pursue cross-examination
    intended to show that the accuseds testimony is false without alleging recent
    fabrication. In particular, if the allegation is merely that the accused is
    lying to avoid conviction, there is no allegation of recent fabrication because
    there is no suggestion that an event other than the accuseds perpetration of
    the crime gave rise to a motive to fabricate: <i>Kailayapillai</i>, at para.
    44.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Deference to the Trial Judge</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The starting point of my analysis is that the
    trial judges finding that the Crown did not allege recent fabrication in
    cross-examination is entitled to some deference. The trial judge had a front
    row seat during the entire three-day examination-in-chief and cross-examination
    of the appellant. He listened to the evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> and the
    detailed submissions on admissibility of both defence and Crown counsel. He was
    best placed to determine whether an implicit allegation of recent fabrication
    arose from the Crowns cross-examination of the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree with my colleagues suggestion, at
    para. 119 of her reasons, that the trial judges failure to give an explanation
    in his post-trial reasons for his ruling that the Crown had not alleged recent
    fabrication removes the need for deference. It would have been preferable if
    the trial judge had given such reasons. However, his reasons for finding the
    Crown had not alleged recent fabrication are apparent from his comments during
    the submissions at the <i>voir dire</i> and are responsive to the arguments the
    defence made at the <i>voir dire</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the <i>voir dire</i>, the principal
    submission of the defence was that the circumstances of the case made it likely
    that the jury would consider the appellants evidence as recent fabrication.
    The defence stressed the fact that the appellant was testifying four years
    following the event and had called expert evidence to support his explanation.
    Defence counsel submitted that these circumstances call for recent fabrication
    thinking on the part of the trier of fact. The Crown had suggested that the
    appellant made up his evidence to avoid getting into trouble. The defence
    argued that this suggestion would lead the jury to infer that the appellant
    made up his evidence in response to the expert evidence on pedal
    misapplication. The defence further submitted that this danger was so strong
    that the statement should still be admitted even if the Crown did not expressly
    or implicitly allege recent fabrication. The prospect that the circumstances of
    the case would enable the jury to infer recent fabrication thus necessitated
    the s admission of the statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Notably, defence counsel did not specifically
    point to the passage that the appellant now alleges constituted an allegation
    of recent fabrication. Instead, defence counsel focused on the final question
    the Crown asked the appellant in cross-examination. In that question, Crown
    counsel stated that your explanation for this all happening unexpectedly,
    surprisingly to you, is simply made up so that you cannot get in trouble,
    right?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge expressed considerable
    difficulty with the defence submissions on recent fabrication. In response to
    defence counsels submissions, he stated:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA>But by simply
    saying to any witness, in any trial, youve made this up, this story is
    concocted, does that open the doorwhere there is some evidence that the
    accusedhad said something exculpatory earlier. Thats the issue I think we
    have to grapple with because every time the Crown makes that kind of suggestion
    doesnt kick open the door.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This statement by the trial judge explains his
    ruling. The trial judge did not accept that Crown counsels questions designed
    to show that the appellant had made up his story, particularly the Crowns
    final question to the appellant, constituted an allegation of recent
    fabrication, whether express or implied. Instead, the trial judge concluded
    that Crown counsel had simply alleged that the appellant was lying to avoid
    conviction. This conclusion is responsive to the arguments on recent
    fabrication that defence counsel put to the trial judge at the <i>voir dire</i>,
    namely that the Crowns bare allegation that the appellant had made up his
    evidence was sufficient to trigger the recent fabrication exception given the
    circumstances of the case.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The Crown Did Not Allege Recent Fabrication in Cross-Examination</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>My colleague focuses on one question from the
    Crowns lengthy cross-examination of the appellant to ground her finding that
    the Crown alleged recent fabrication. I will refer to this question as the
    impugned passage. My colleague acknowledges that one possible interpretation of
    the Crowns suggestion in this passage is that the Crown was alleging that the
    appellant was fabricating his evidence from the outset to escape liability.
    However, she concludes that, considered in the context of the entire trial,
    especially the proposed evidence of the appellants expert, Dr. Van Ee, the
    Crowns suggestion can also be viewed as containing an implicit suggestion that
    the appellant was tailoring his evidence to correspond with his experts
    proposed evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, my colleague effectively analyzes
    the impugned passage in isolation from the rest of Crown counsels
    cross-examination of the appellant. When the impugned passage is considered in
    the context of the Crowns entire cross-examination of the appellant, it
    follows that the jury would not have understood the Crowns apparent position
    to be that the appellant had recently fabricated his evidence. The Crowns
    entire cross-examination of the appellant, including the passages that directly
    preceded and followed the impugned passage, make clear that the Crowns
    position was that the only reason the appellant stated he was startled was that
    he was lying to avoid conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For ease of reference, I reproduce the impugned
    passage below:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA>Q. You see, sir,
    Im going to suggest to you the only reason you say I was startled. I was
    surprised that he opened the door is because youre trying to provide some
    explanation as to why, in this startle and surprise, you hit the gas pedal
    unintentionally, thats why youre saying you were startled and surprised,
    right?</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA>A. Sorry, youre
    not me. I dont think its fair for you to say what I felt, or assume what I
    felt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If the impugned passage is seen in isolation
    from the rest of the cross-examination, an implied allegation of recent
    fabrication is one possible interpretation. The appellant stresses that Crown
    counsel emphasized the word startled, a word contained in Dr. Van Ees expert
    report and that Dr. Van Ee used in his trial testimony that followed the
    appellants testimony and the <i>voir dire</i> ruling. This emphasis, coupled
    with the statement that the only reason the appellant stated he was startled
    was to provide some explanation for unintentional acceleration, in the
    appellants eyes demonstrates that Crown counsel was alleging that the
    appellant tailored his evidence to match the anticipated expert evidence about
    pedal misapplication. If the appellants interpretation of this question is
    accepted, the question would constitute an implicit allegation of recent
    fabrication. The appellants reception of Dr. Van Ees expert report would be
    an intermediate event between the crash and the appellants trial testimony that
    gave the appellant a new reason to fabricate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the following six factors make clear
    that, when considered in context, the jury would not have understood Crown
    counsels apparent position to be that the appellant had recently fabricated
    his evidence. Instead, the jury would have understood the Crowns reference to
    the only reason in the impugned passage as an argument supporting the Crowns
    explicit position that the only reason the appellant stated he was startled was
    that he was lying to avoid conviction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the dominant theme of Crown counsels
    cross-examination of the appellant was to demonstrate that the appellant lies
    to avoid getting into trouble and that the appellants assertions about
    unintentional acceleration were implausible in light of the evidence of the
    other witnesses. For instance, Crown counsel elicited from the appellant in
    cross-examination that he had planned to lie to the police if stopped while
    driving and had concluded on one occasion that it was better to lie [to his
    father] to avoid getting into more trouble than to tell the truth. Crown
    counsels questioning challenged the appellants testimony and attempted to
    show that it was implausible and inconsistent with the evidence of the other
    witnesses. Crown counsels final question to the appellant shows that this was
    the dominant theme. As the Crown put to the appellant, your explanation for
    this all happening unexpectedly, surprisingly to you, is simply made up so that
    you cannot get in trouble, right?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the questioning that led up to and
    followed the impugned passage was focused on demonstrating that the appellants
    assertions were inconsistent with the evidence of the other witnesses and
    inherently implausible. For instance, prior to the impugned passage, Crown
    counsel put to the appellant that his testimony that he thought or hoped
    Constable Styles would just walk away when the appellant refused to get out of
    the vehicle was implausible. In the question directly preceding the impugned
    passage, Crown counsels question suggested to the appellant that it made no
    sense for him to be startled because he must have expected the officer to pull
    him out of the vehicle when he refused to exit. Immediately following the
    impugned passage, Crown counsel continued this line of questioning, suggesting
    that it was improbable that the appellant thought as long as you kept begging
    [Constable Styles] would somehow disappear and go back to his cruiser and go
    home.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, I would note that Crown counsel did not
    use any language referring to the timing of the appellants testimony in the
    impugned passage. This is significant because, as this court held in <i>Vassel</i>,
    at para. 124, an allegation of recent fabrication must incorporate an
    assertion that <u>at some identifiable point in time</u> the witness began to
    make the claim being challenged (emphasis added). The absence of language such
    as you now say in this passage, which would have directed the jurys
    attention to the timing of the appellants testimony, weighs against the appellants
    submission that implicit in the question was the allegation that the appellant
    only adopted his story after learning of Dr. Van Ees expert evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth, the appellant himself testified in his
    evidence-in-chief that Constable Styles startled him by reaching into the
    car. Crown counsels reference to the word startled in the impugned passage
    and elsewhere in cross-examination must be understood in this context. Thus, I
    do not accept that Crown counsels reference to the appellants statement that
    he was startled tends to show that Crown counsel was implicitly alleging
    recent fabrication. Crown counsel was entitled to put the appellants own words
    back to him and allege that it was implausible that he would be startled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fifth, Dr. Van Ees evidence would have helped
    dispel any suggestion that the appellant was tailoring his claim of
    unintentional acceleration to match the evidence of Dr. Van Ee. In
    examination-in-chief, Dr. Van Ee testified that the appellants counsel had
    asked him to evaluate whether the appellants assertion that he did not
    intentionally set the vehicle in motion or accelerate accorded with the
    principles of biomechanics. Likewise, Crown counsel began his cross-examination
    of Dr. Van Ee by emphasizing that the appellants counsel had retained Dr. Van
    Ee to evaluate the appellants assertion that he did not intentionally set the
    vehicle in motion. The jury would thus have understood that the appellant
    asserted that he did not intentionally set the vehicle in motion prior to retaining
    Dr. Van Ee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sixth, as I have explained, defence counsel did
    not mention the impugned passage during his submissions at the <i>voir dire</i> on recent fabrication and did not focus his argument on the Crowns apparent
    position being an allegation of recent fabrication. Defence counsel instead
    stressed the final question in the Crowns cross-examination, which, as I have
    explained, merely alleges that the appellant was lying to avoid conviction. The
    fact that defence counsel did not focus on the impugned passage despite giving
    fulsome submissions on the <i>voir dire</i> suggests that the interpretation of
    this passage as containing an allegation of recent fabrication is not as strong
    as my colleague considers it to be. Moreover, defence counsel did not focus his
    submissions on the argument that the Crowns apparent position was that the
    appellant had recently fabricated his evidence. Instead, defence counsels
    submissions focused on the risk that the jury would infer recent fabrication
    from the circumstances of the case regardless of Crown counsels express or
    apparent position on recent fabrication. Defence counsels seeming lack of
    confidence in the argument that the Crowns apparent position alleged recent
    fabrication weighs against the interpretation of the impugned passage that the
    appellant now advances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These six factors lead me to conclude that the
    jury would not have understood the impugned passage as suggesting that Crown
    counsels apparent position was that the appellant was tailoring his evidence
    to match that of Dr. Van Ee. The jury would have instead understood Crown
    counsels position to be that the appellant was lying because he had committed
    the crime and wanted to avoid conviction, and that his testimony was inherently
    implausible and at odds with the other evidence. I would adopt the reasons of
    Watt J.A. in <i>Vassel</i>, at para. 130, as applicable to the case at bar:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:
120%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif;border:none'><span style='border:none'>The
    allegation or implication was thatthe appellant was simply lying to avoid
    conviction. In other words, his motive to fabricate was his invol<span
style='border:none'>vement in the [crime]. No point in time when he would have
    decided to lie to avoid conviction was suggested to him. Any alleged prior
    consistent statement would therefore have nothing to rebut.</span></span></span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Crowns Closing Not a Basis to Attack Admissibility Ruling</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principal factor that my colleague appears
    to rely on to find that the trial judge should have admitted the statement was
    the Crowns closing address. My colleague appears to rely on the closing
    address to prefer the interpretation of the impugned passage as an allegation
    of recent fabrication over the contrary interpretation that the Crown was
    simply alleging that the appellant was lying to avoid conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree with my colleague that it is
    appropriate to use the Crowns closing as a basis to impugn the trial judges
    ruling that the statement was inadmissible. The trial judge had to decide
    whether the Crown had alleged recent fabrication and thus whether the statement
    was admissible before the Crowns closing. Following the Crowns closing, the
    issue was no longer the admissibility of the statement but the adequacy of the
    corrective instruction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with my colleague that Crown counsel
    alleged a form of recent fabrication in the closing. Crown counsel stressed
    that the appellant did not mention unintentional setting in motion to the
    paramedic. He then asked the jury, [i]snt that the very first thing [the
    appellant] would say when somebody said to him what happened? In other words,
    Crown counsel alleged that if the appellant was truthful, he would have raised
    unintentional setting in motion in his conversation with the paramedic. The
    implication is that the appellant invented the unintentional setting in motion
    account following his conversation with the paramedic. As this court held in <i>Campbell</i>,
    at p. 687, to allege that a witness failure to mention a circumstance on an
    earlier occasion shows that the witness invented the story since that occasion
    will constitute an allegation of recent fabrication. Likewise, as Sidney N.
    Lederman, Alan W. Bryant &amp; Michelle K. Fuerst explain in <i>The Law of
    Evidence in Canada</i>, 5th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2018), at
    para. 7.20, the recent fabrication exception is triggered where the opposing
    party alleges that a witness who is truthful would have raised an issue at an
    early opportunity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, reliance on the Crowns closing address
    to ground the conclusion that the trial judge erred in failing to admit the
    statement improperly places the trial judge in a Catch-22. On my colleagues
    approach, the trial judges error was failing to appreciate that the context of
    the Crowns closing meant that the Crown had alleged recent fabrication in
    cross-examination, which in turn meant that the trial judge should have
    admitted the statement. Yet the trial judge had to make his ruling on the
    admissibility of the statement prior to the Crowns closing. As I have
    explained, at the time he made his ruling, the context of the Crowns entire
    cross-examination of the appellant would have made clear to the trial judge and
    the jury that the Crown was simply alleging that the appellant was lying to
    avoid conviction. At this point, the trial judge had no way of foreseeing that
    the Crown would allege recent fabrication in the closing address. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Furthermore, following the Crowns closing,
    defence counsel no longer sought to admit the statement. Instead, the defence
    sought a mistrial. Defence counsel submitted that it would be impossible to
    reopen the case to admit the statement. in a way that did not prejudice the
    defence. Both the trial judge and Crown counsel stated that they understood
    defence counsel to argue that reopening the case to admit the statement was not
    an available remedy as a result. Defence counsel did nothing to dispel this
    perception of the defence position. Thus, if the finding of recent fabrication
    only crystallized during the closing address, the trial judge did not err in
    failing to admit the statement when the defence no longer sought that admission
    of the statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, reopening the case and admitting
    the statement following the Crowns closing would have unduly complicated the
    trial. My colleagues conclusion that adducing the statement would not have
    unduly complicated the trial is likely true at the time of the <i>voir dire</i>.
    However, this conclusion clearly would not apply to reopening the case
    following the Crowns closing. As defence counsel submitted, at that stage it
    would be impossible to reopen the case in a way that did not prejudice the
    defence. Defence counsel told the trial judge that reopening the case would
    risk causing the defence to incu[r] the jurys wrath for causing further
    delay and would send the case into turmoil. The defence would need time to
    consider which additional evidence to call, this additional evidence could be
    considerable, and new closing addresses would be required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The allegation of recent fabrication in Crowns
    closing is properly treated under the mistrial issue, rather than used to
    impugn the trial judges earlier decision not to admit the statement. I agree
    with my colleague that the trial judges corrective instruction in response to
    the Crowns closing was inadequate. Yet I do not accept that the Crowns
    closing provides a basis to hold that the trial judge erred in declining to
    admit the statement when the admission of the statement following the Crowns
    closing was neither sought by the defence nor feasible at this stage of the
    trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>I also disagree with my colleagues conclusion, at para. 126 of her
    reasons, that the statement should have been admitted not only to respond to an
    allegation of recent fabrication, but also to provide overall context for the
    jury about what the appellant had said close in time to the incident  and
    prior to obtaining an experts report on pedal misapplication. In my view,
    overall context is not an appropriate basis for admission. It adds nothing of
    value that admission under the recent fabrication exception does not provide
    and only risks confusing the jury.</span></p>
  <p style='

    Basis of Admission Is Unnecessary</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since my colleague concludes that the recent
    fabrication exception applies, the overall context ground for admission is
    unnecessary and redundant. The recent fabrication exception exists to allow the
    jury to assess an allegation of recent fabrication in its proper context. For
    instance, assuming that the Crown had alleged that the appellant recently
    fabricated his evidence after learning of Dr. Van Ees evidence on pedal
    misapplication, the jury would lack the proper context to evaluate this argument
    without the admission of the appellants statement. The admission of the
    statement would give the jury the proper context to evaluate the argument by
    making clear to the jury that the appellant had stated that he accelerated
    unintentionally prior to learning of Dr. Van Ees evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus it is unclear to me what additional value
    the overall context basis of admission adds to the recent fabrication basis of
    admission. If admitted to rebut recent fabrication, the appellants statement
    to his father would lack any probative value beyond showing that the
    [appellants] story did not change as a result of a new motive to fabricate,
    namely learning of Dr. Van Ees proposed expert evidence: <i>Stirling</i>, at
    para. 7. My colleagues reasons do not identify any additional probative value
    that overall context provides. In fact, my colleagues reasons suggest that the
    appellants statement is admissible to provide overall context because he made
    it prior to obtaining Dr. Van Ees report. This confirms that the probative
    value flowing from the overall context basis of admission is precisely the same
    as that flowing from the recent fabrication basis of admission, namely to show
    that the appellant did not change his story as a result of learning of Dr. Van
    Ees expert evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the fact that my colleague concludes
    that the statement was inadmissible pursuant to the narrative exception
    confirms that the overall context basis of admission adds no additional value.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The narrative exception is the usual mechanism to
    admit otherwise inadmissible evidence in order to provide overall context to
    the jury. As my colleague explains, the narrative exception takes two forms:
    true or pure narrative, and narrative as circumstantial evidence: see <i>R. v.
    Khan</i>, 2017 ONCA 114, 136 O.R. (3d) 520, at paras. 29-31, leave to appeal
    refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 139. Prior consistent statements adduced as pure
    narrative carry no weight. They are admitted so that the jury can understand
    the unfolding of events: <i>Khan</i>, at para. 30. Statements admitted as pure
    narrative provide background information that would provide chronological
    cohesion and eliminate gaps which would divert the mind of the listener from
    the central issue: <i>R. v. Fair</i> (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 18.
    In contrast, under the narrative as circumstantial evidence category, the
    circumstances surrounding the statement allow the statement to assist the trier
    of fact to assess the credibility and reliability of the witness in-court
    testimony: <i>Khan</i>, at para. 31.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Yet my colleague concludes, at para. 117 of her
    reasons, that the statement was inadmissible under either form of the narrative
    exception. As she states, the statement did not possess the circumstantial
    indicia of truthfulness required to justify its admission under the narrative
    as circumstantial evidence exception. Moreover, she notes that the defence did
    not tender the statement as pure narrative. My colleagues conclusion that the
    statement was inadmissible under either form of the narrative exception thus is
    in tension with her conclusion that the trial judge should have admitted the
    statement to provide overall context.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Furthermore, if the statement is admissible
    under the recent fabrication exception as my colleague concludes it is, then
    there would be no basis for the trial judge to exercise his residual discretion
    to admit it for the additional basis of overall context. Since my colleague
    does not justify the admission of the statement to provide overall context
    under the narrative exception, I understand her to hold that the trial judge
    should have exercised his residual discretion to admit the statement to provide
    overall context. Residual discretion permits the trial judge to admit probative
    defence evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible by virtue of an
    exclusionary rule of evidence: <i>R. v. Finta</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 701, at p.
    854, quoting <i>R. v. Williams</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 356 (Ont. C.A.), at
    p. 378, leave to appeal refused, [1985] S.C.C.A. No. 168. It has no role to
    play where the exclusionary rule does not apply because a recognized exception
    to that rule is triggered, such as the recent fabrication exception that my
    colleague concludes was triggered in this case.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, admitting the statement to provide

    unhelpful but also potentially dangerous. The overall context additional basis
    of admission would risk confusing the jury and deflecting its attention away from
    the central issues and toward collateral issues, concerns that are significant
    in the context of prior consistent statements: <i>R. v. Béland</i>, [1987] 2
    S.C.R. 398, at pp. 410-411. The Supreme Courts recent decision in <i>R. v.
    Goldfinch</i>, 2019 SCC 38, provides a useful illustration of why this is so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <i>Goldfinch</i>, the defence in a sexual
    assault trial sought the admission of evidence that the relationship between
    the accused and the complainant had a sexual component at the time of the
    events giving rise to the charge. During the <i>voir dire</i>, the only
    relevant use of the sexual history evidence that the defence identified was to
    provide context on the relationship between the accused and the complainant.
    The trial judge admitted this sexual history evidence. She gave a limiting
    instruction that told the jury that they could not use the evidence that the
    relationship had a sexual component to support either of the twin myths, namely
    that women with sexual experience are more likely to consent to sexual activity
    or are less worthy of belief. However, the trial judge stated that the only
    positive use of this evidence was to provide the jury with some context for
    the relationship between the complainant and the accused. The jury acquitted
    the accused. The Supreme Court ordered a new trial on the basis that the trial
    judge erred in admitting the sexual history evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his concurring opinion, Moldaver J. held that
    the trial judges limiting instruction was flawed. The mere reference to some
    context failed to identify any permissible use of the sexual history evidence
    and did not explain how the jury could use that evidence to resolve specific
    facts and issues relating to the defence: at paras. 136, 147. Accordingly,
    Moldaver J. concluded that the instruction meant that the jury was left in the
    dark about how they could use the evidence: at para. 137.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Admitting the statement to provide overall
    context, even accompanied by a limiting instruction, risks creating a similar
    problem to the one that Moldaver J. identified in <i>Goldfinch</i>. While the
    jury would understand the impermissible uses of the statement, it is unclear
    how the trial judge could identify any specific facts or issues relevant to the
    defence that the overall context basis of admission would assist the jury to
    resolve. As I have explained, the admission of the statement to rebut recent
    fabrication would show that the appellants story was the same or similar even
    before he learned of Dr. Van Ees proposed expert evidence, and it is unclear
    what additional value overall context would add. An instruction telling the
    jury that they could use the statement as overall context about what the
    appellant had said close in time to the crash would thus risk confusing the
    jury by outlining only impermissible inferences without explaining how the jury
    could legitimately use the overall context basis of admission to resolve
    specific issues.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would make three additional comments on the
    issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[196]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, during the cross-examination of S.K., the
    Crown made no allusion to the pedal misapplication expert evidence that the
    defence intended to call. The Crowns cross-examination focused on the inherent
    implausibilities contained in S.K.s narrative of the material events.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, before the conclusion of S.K.s
    examination-in-chief, defence counsel sought direction from the trial judge on
    two areas of questioning he wanted to pursue with S.K., specifically that: (i)
    the police officers at the scene and the hospital had not asked S.K. what had
    happened; and (ii) S.K. told his father what had happened when he became able
    to speak. Defence counsel did not intend to elicit, at that stage of the trial,
    the contents of what S.K. told his father because thats something that were
    going to argue at another time. The Crown objected to the questions. The trial
    judge ruled them irrelevant at that point of the trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Consequently, before the Crown had ever started
    its cross-examination of S.K., the defence already had signaled its intention
    to adduce S.K.s statement to his father. Obviously, at that stage of the
    trial, the admission of such a prior consistent statement could not have been
    in response to a Crown allegation of recent fabrication, either express or
    implied, as the Crown had not yet embarked on its cross-examination of S.K.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the defence pedal misapplication
    expert, Dr. Van Ee, had not testified before S.K. was cross-examined by the
    Crown. There was no evidence that S.K. was aware of what Dr. Van Ee would say.
    In those circumstances, the mere fact that the defence retains an expert to
    testify on an element of the offence charged is not a sufficient evidentiary
    basis to open the door to the admission of prior consistent statements where,
    in its cross-examination of the accused, the Crown simply asserts that the
    accused has lied, without suggesting, expressly or impliedly, that something
    has occurred between the event giving rise to the charge and the accuseds
    testimony that has provided the accused with a motive to testify falsely: <em>Kailayapillai</em>,
    at para. 43.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with my
    colleagues conclusion that the trial judge erred in failing to admit the
    appellants statement to his father to rebut implicit allegations of recent
    fabrication arising from the overall circumstances of the case: at para. 112.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I agree with my colleagues conclusion,
    at para. 15 of her reasons, that the trial judges failure to instruct the jury
    that the appellants age and level of maturity were important factors for them
    to consider in assessing whether he knew his dangerous driving was likely to
    cause Constable Styless death is a sufficient basis alone on which to allow
    the appeal.</span></p>
