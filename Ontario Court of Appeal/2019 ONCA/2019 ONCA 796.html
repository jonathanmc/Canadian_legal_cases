  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault
    and sentenced to 14 months in jail, to be followed by 3 years probation. He
    appeals conviction and, if leave is granted, appeals sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This was a straightforward single-issue case.
    The complainant testified that she did not consent to sexual intercourse with
    the appellant who was her roommate. According to her, she was asleep when the
    appellant penetrated her. The appellant testified that the complainant did
    consent to sexual intercourse. The Crown also introduced a video statement made
    to the police by the appellant after his arrest. The defence agreed that the
    statement was voluntary. Parts of the statement were internally inconsistent,
    but the trial judge found that parts of the statement were inculpatory. He
    accepted those parts of the statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the evidence of the
    appellant. He believed the complainant’s testimony. He also expressly indicated
    that the appellant’s evidence did not leave him with a reasonable doubt and
    that, on the totality of the evidence, the Crown had proved guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raises several somewhat
    interrelated grounds of appeal. First, he takes issue with several aspects of
    the trial judge’s analysis of the complainant’s evidence. He submits that the
    trial judge “glossed over” certain inconsistencies in her evidence concerning
    the events that ultimately led her to report the incident to the police about
    two months after it occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge referred to this evidence at
    length in his summary of the evidence. Parts of the complainant’s evidence in
    this area could be described as confusing. They were not, however, necessarily
    inconsistent. It was the trial judge’s responsibility to assess that part of
    the complainant’s evidence in the context of the totality of the evidence and
    having regard to the only live issue at trial – did the Crown prove that the
    complainant did not consent? There was no error in the trial judge’s treatment
    of the complainant’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Next, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    did not properly take into account the appellant’s intellectual limitations
    when assessing the evidence. The trial judge did take this evidence into
    account when evaluating what he should make of the appellant’s statement to the
    police. The defence had argued that the appellant’s intellectual limitations
    explained many of the deficiencies in his statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge, who had the advantage of seeing
    the video, concluded that the appellant’s intellectual limitations played no
    role in his ability to comprehend and respond to the questions put to him by
    the police officer. The trial judge gave reasons for that finding. They are
    unassailable. The trial judge’s failure to refer specifically to a
    psychological report prepared many years earlier when the appellant was in
    grade one, and entered through the appellant’s mother, is of no consequence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The argument that the trial judge engaged in
    uneven scrutiny of the evidence of the appellant and the complainant finds no
    support in the reasons. The trial judge scrutinized all of the evidence
    carefully, including the testimony of the appellant and the complainant. He
    also carefully reviewed the appellant’s statement to the police and the
    arguments arising out of that statement. The trial judge may not have given
    some inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence on peripheral matters the
    significance that the appellant says he should have. However, that does not
    suggest uneven scrutiny.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The submission that the trial judge determined
    guilt exclusively by treating the case as involving a “credibility contest”
    between the appellant and the complainant without regard to the burden of proof
    ignores the trial judge’s repeated references to, and application of, the
    burden of proof as captured in the well-known principles found in <em>R. v.
    W.D.</em> The appellant’s submission that the trial judge decided the case based
    exclusively on a credibility assessment rests on a single sentence in the
    reasons and ignores the repeated earlier references to the burden of proof. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the argument that the trial judge
    misapprehended material parts of the evidence cannot succeed. Counsel reviewed
    the findings. In our view, the findings of fact essential to the verdict were
    firmly rooted in the evidence. Even if the trial judge misapprehended evidence
    in respect of a peripheral fact, that misapprehension does not affect the
    validity of the verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The conviction appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jail term of 14 months imposed by the trial
    judge was well within the applicable range. The seriousness of the offence and
    the aggravating circumstances (the complainant, who was the appellant’s
    roommate, was asleep when the assault occurred) warranted a significant
    reformatory term. Fourteen months is well within that range. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We also would not interfere with the three-year
    probation order imposed by the trial judge. The reasons provided by the trial
    judge provide ample justification for the order. The terms are not particularly
    onerous. It is also open to the appellant, should the proper basis arise, to
    apply to the trial court for early termination of the probation order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeals from conviction and sentence are
