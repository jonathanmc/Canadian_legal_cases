  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Thorburn
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is an appeal by Royal and Sun Alliance
    Insurance Company of Canada (“RSA”) from the trial judge’s decision that RSA
    was responsible to provide insurance coverage to its insured, Steven
    Devecseri’s estate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 29, 2006, the plaintiff/respondent
    Jeffrey Bradfield, Paul Latanski and the late Steven Devecseri&nbsp;were riding
    their motorcycles. Devecseri was in front. He drove onto the wrong side of the
    road and collided with Jeremy Caton’s automobile. Bradfield did not hit Caton’s
    automobile. Devecseri was killed and Caton was injured. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Devecseri was insured by RSA under a standard
    motor vehicle policy with a $1 million limit. He had an M2 driver’s licence,
    which prohibited him from operating a motorcycle with any alcohol in his
    bloodstream. To do so, constituted a policy violation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the first action brought by Caton, Devecseri
    and Bradfield were found liable for damages resulting from the motor vehicle
    accident. The issue of whether RSA was required to provide insurance coverage
    to Devecseri was not determined.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the second action, the trial judge was asked
    to determine whether RSA was entitled to take an off-coverage position and
    reduce the estate’s policy limit from $1 million to $200,000 after it learned
    that Devecseri had been drinking before the accident, contrary to the terms of
    his insurance policy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge held that RSA waived its right
    to rely on Devecseri’s policy breach because RSA had taken its off-coverage
    position too late. He held that Bradfield was entitled to recover judgment in
    the amount of $800,000 against RSA. The trial judge drew his conclusions for
    the following reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>RSA did not obtain the coroner’s report after Devecseri’s fatal
    accident in 2006, which stated that Devecseri had alcohol in his system at the
    time of death; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Having alcohol in his system was contrary to the terms of
    Devecseri’s M2 licence and his insurance policy; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>“[S]ecuring a copy of the Coroner’s report would not be a
    non-mandatory item on a list of suggested areas to investigate”; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Knowledge of the policy breach was imputed as of the time the
    coroner’s report was available to RSA in 2006; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>“RSA’s failure to take an off-coverage position after June 2006, its
    defence of the claim in 2008, and continuing until discovery in 2009, amounted
    to a waiver by conduct of Devecseri’s breach.… Having found waiver, the issue
    of estoppel is rendered moot.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>RSA appeals the trial judge’s finding that RSA
    waived its right to deny coverage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>RSA claims that waiver requires actual knowledge
    of the breach and there was no actual knowledge of the breach in this case.
    Moreover, there was no clear waiver of the breach in writing as provided in s.
    131(1) of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>RSA further claims there can be no estoppel, as
    there was no knowledge of the breach until 2009 and there is no evidence the
    defence would have been conducted any differently had RSA taken an off-coverage
    position in 2006. As such, there was no detrimental reliance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I find that RSA did
    not waive and is not estopped from denying coverage. The appeal is therefore
    granted.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no dispute as to the facts.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>RSA’s investigation</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 6, 2006, RSA engaged an adjuster to
    investigate the circumstances surrounding the accident. RSA instructed its
    adjuster to obtain “any and all information with regard to this accident from the
    investigating police service and the coroner (death certificate)”. According to
    the adjuster, this form was a “list of non-mandatory, suggested areas to
    investigate.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The adjuster obtained the police report which
    concluded that “excessive speed was a major contributing factor in the
    collision” but made no mention of alcohol. The RSA adjuster testified that he
    believed that if alcohol was involved, it would have been disclosed in the
    police report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>None of the parties obtained a copy of the
    coroner’s report. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before 2009, Bradfield’s insurer received
    hearsay information that drinking was involved in the accident but did not
    disclose that information to RSA’s adjuster.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>RSA’s adjuster interviewed Bradfield and
    Latanski as part of his investigation. Neither told the adjuster that Devecseri
    had been drinking before the accident. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The First Trial</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 27, 2008, Caton (the automobile driver)
    brought a claim for damages against Bradfield, Latanski and Devecseri’s estate.
    RSA filed a Statement of Defence on March 5, 2009. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During his examination for discovery on June
    24-25, 2009, Latanski advised for the first time that Devecseri and Bradfield
    were drinking beer shortly before the accident. Bradfield testified that he was
    at the bar but could not recall if Devecseri was drinking. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 8, 2009, one year after the claim was
    brought and two weeks after Latanski’s testimony at discovery, RSA advised the
    parties that it was taking an “off-coverage position” as a result of this
    disclosure. It did so on the basis that having a blood alcohol level above zero
    was contrary to Mr. Devecseri’s M2 motorcycle licence and a breach of his
    insurance policy. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At no time did RSA provide the estate notice in
    writing that it was waiving the policy violation, as described in s. 131(1) of
    the <em>Insurance Act.</em> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2012, the jury awarded Caton $1.8 million: it
    held Bradfield 10% at fault and Devecseri’s estate&nbsp;90% at fault. Bradfield
    was indemnified against Devecseri’s estate and obtained judgment on his
    crossclaim against the estate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue of whether RSA could deny coverage was
    deferred.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Second Trial</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the second trial, Bradfield sought a
    declaration of entitlement to recover judgment against RSA for the remaining
    $800,000 available in Devecseri’s policy ($200,000 had already been paid out)
    pursuant to s. 258 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>. Bradfield took the position
    that RSA had waived or was estopped from denying Devecseri’s estate insurance
    coverage because Bradfield submitted that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Bradfield obtained judgment on his crossclaim against the estate;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>RSA knew Devecseri breached the terms of the policy by having a
    blood alcohol level above zero, contrary to the terms of Devecseri’s M2
    motorcycle licence and in breach of his insurance policy. Knowing of the
    breach, RSA chose to defend the claim; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>RSA’s conduct from May 2006 to July 2009 amounted to a waiver of its
    right to assert a policy breach and deny coverage; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Prejudice is presumed given the three-year delay. In any event,
    there was prejudice and detrimental reliance such that RSA should be estopped
    from denying coverage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>RSA took the position that it had no knowledge
    of the breach until 2009, at which point it denied coverage. As such, it did
    not waive the policy breach. Moreover, there was no prejudice as the litigation
    administrator for Devecseri’s estate and counsel for Caton both testified that
    the only difference between RSA defending the action and being added as a
    statutory third party was the style of cause. The litigation steps would not
    have been any different. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge awarded Bradfield $800,000 from
    RSA on the basis that RSA waived its right to rely on a policy breach and was
    therefore responsible to pay the claim against Devecseri’s estate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He held that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par58>58</a>]&nbsp;From a
    common-sense perspective and in the context of an insurer’s investigation of a
    motor vehicle accident involving a fatality, evidence of alcohol in the
    deceased’s bloodstream—routinely detailed in Coroner’s reports—is clearly
    relevant in determining if a policy breach has taken place.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par63>63</a>]&nbsp;Contrary to RSA’s
    submission, I find that evidence&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;exist that Devecseri
    had alcohol in his bloodstream at the time of death. That evidence was available
    in a Coroner’s report dated August 29, 2006. That report was available for
    release three years before the 2009 discoveries where Latanski testified that
    Devecseri was drinking alcohol before the accident. When RSA received the
    Coroner’s report from Caton’s counsel in 2009, it unequivocally provided
    evidence of a policy breach.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par64>64</a>]&nbsp;The [adjustor]
    Eddy Report specifically acknowledged RSA’s direction to obtain a copy of the
    Coroner’s report. As already reviewed, for reasons not explained, RSA took no
    steps to obtain a copy of the Coroner’s report. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par65>65</a>] On August 13, 2008,
    Forbes delivered a notice of intent to defend. In March 2009, he filed a
    statement of defence and counterclaim, formally stating, as in&nbsp;<em>Logel</em>,
    “we elect to defend”. That defence did not set out any reservation of rights
    letter or proposal of a non-waiver agreement. As held in&nbsp;<em>Rosenblood</em>&nbsp;at
    para 21:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>When a claim
    is presented to an insurer the facts giving rise to the claim should be
    investigated. If there is no coverage then the insured [as in the present
    matter, the Estate] should be told at once and the insurer should have nothing
    further to do with the claim if it wishes to maintain its off-coverage
    position. If coverage is questionable the insurer should advise the insured at once
    and in the absence of a non-waiver agreement or of an adequate reservation of
    rights letter defends the claim at its risk.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par66>66</a>] At discovery on June
    24-25, 2009, Latanski provided evidence that Devecseri was drinking before the
    accident. Forbes volunteered to bring a WAGG motion to obtain the Coroner’s
    report. He later declined, finding that he was in a conflict of interest and
    did not wish to take any steps that could be interpreted as a waiver of rights
    by RSA, while at the same time being duty-bound to Devecseri—whose Estate he
    was appointed to defend. Caton’s counsel volunteered to obtain the Coroner’s
    report.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par67>67</a>]&nbsp;As
    in&nbsp;<em>Logel</em>, nearly three years elapsed from Eddy’s investigation to
    when RSA announced it was taking an off-coverage position, added itself as a
    statutory third-party, and instructed Forbes to remove himself from the record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In short, the trial judge imputed knowledge of
    the breach to RSA on the basis that the evidence was available to RSA, had it
    obtained the coroner’s report. Having decided to defend, RSA waived its right
    to rely on the breach of policy to deny coverage. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Issues</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issues on this appeal are whether the trial
    judge erred in holding that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>RSA waived its right to deny coverage to Devecseri’s estate; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The issue of estoppel was moot. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The central issue is what constitutes knowledge,
    which is a prerequisite for a finding of both waiver and estoppel.
    Determination of the appropriate legal test is a legal issue for which the
    standard of review is correctness.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Waiver by Conduct</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Waiver and promissory estoppel are closely
    related: <em>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime Life Assurance Co</em>.,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principle underlying both doctrines is that
    a party should not be allowed to resile from a choice when it would be unfair
    to the other party to do so. Both require “knowledge” of the policy breach: <em>Economical
    Insurance Group v. Fleming </em>(2009), 89 O.R. (3d) 68, at para. 31, aff’d
    2009 ONCA 112, 69 C.C.L.I. (4th) 185, and <em>Rosenblood Estate v. Law Society

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Waiver will be found where: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>“the party waiving had (1) full knowledge of
    the deficiency that might be relied upon; and (2) the unequivocal and conscious
    intention to relinquish the right to rely on the contract or obligation. The
    creation of such a stringent test reflects the fact that no consideration moves
    from the party in whose favour a waiver operates. An overly broad
    interpretation of waiver would undermine the requirement of contractual
    consideration”: <em>Saskatchewan River Bungalows</em>, at para. 20, and <em>Economical
    Insurance Group, </em>at para. 31.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Knowledge can be inferred from conduct, but
    “that conduct must give evidence of an unequivocal intention to abandon rights
    known to the party waiving the right”: <em>Canadian Federation of

    Students’ Union, </em>2015 ONSC 4093, at para. 129<em>. </em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Logel Estate v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance
    Company</em>, the insurer elected to defend the claim after receiving the
    accident report and the pathology report for a single car collision leading to
    a death: [2008] I.L.R. I-4744 (Ont. S.C.), aff'd 2009 ONCA 252, 70 C.C.L.I.
    (4th) 188. Those reports contained the evidence of the status of the insured’s
    licence and her physical condition. In <em>Logel</em>, the trial judge
    concluded at para. 21:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>“that <span class=Underline>upon receipt</span> they must have had knowledge of the facts including the status of Ms. Logel's
    licence and her physical condition, which gave rise to the exclusion of
    coverage. If they did not appreciate the significance of these facts they
    should have, before they elected to defend.” [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Logel, </em>all facts necessary to
    establish knowledge were within the possession of the insurer. The insurer
    simply did not appreciate the significance of the facts before it elected to
    defend. In the face of this information, the court held that the insurer waived
    the breach by obtaining all the necessary information to enable it to be aware
    of a policy breach and deciding to defend the claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, RSA knew Devecseri had an M2
    licence and it was a breach of the policy to consume any alcohol before
    driving. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, it is agreed that RSA had no actual
    knowledge that Devecseri breached the policy by consuming alcohol before
    driving until 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, unlike <em>Logel</em>, knowledge of a
    policy breach could not be imputed, as RSA did not have all of the material
    facts from which to determine there was a policy breach. This was not a case where
    RSA failed to appreciate the significance of information; it did not have
    information that Devecseri had been drinking and had thereby breached the terms
    of the policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, there is no evidence to support Bradfield’s
    assertion that RSA knew of the policy breach but chose not to take possession
    of the information. No legal authority was proffered to support Bradfield’s
    assertion that an insurer must obtain the coroner’s report. It is also agreed
    that, although information as to the blood alcohol content was in the coroner’s
    report, there is no evidence that RSA knew that information was contained in
    the coroner’s report and knowing that, chose not to get the coroner’s report. On
    the contrary, had RSA obtained the report, it would not have expended monies
    conducting further investigation and defending the claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, there was no written waiver of the
    breach on the part of RSA, as required by s. 131(1) of the <em>Insurance Act</em>,
    to demonstrate a clear intention to waive the policy breach. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, it was not correct to
    conclude that RSA waived its right to refuse coverage for breach of the terms
    of the insurance policy.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Estoppel</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The essential elements of estoppel are that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As in the case of waiver, the insurer must have knowledge of the
    facts that support a lack of coverage; and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Unlike waiver, there must be “a course of conduct by the insurer
    upon which the insured relied to its detriment.” <em>Rosenblood Estate,</em> at
    p. 18.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Rosenblood Estate</em>,<em> </em>a credit
    union claimed its solicitor was dishonest, resulting in losses to the credit
    union. The credit union sued the solicitor, who was insured by the Law Society.
    The Law Society retained counsel to defend the claim against the solicitor. Two
    years later, the Law Society advised the estate that it was denying coverage on
    the grounds that the loss was caused by dishonesty, which was excluded from
    coverage, and that the insured solicitor was in breach of the policy by failing
    to give timely notice of possible claims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The court in <em>Rosenblood</em> held that the
    insurer was estopped from denying coverage, as the insurer had all of the
    relevant facts necessary to decide whether to defend the fraud claim but
    nonetheless elected to defend the claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The insurer in <em>Rosenblood</em> should have
    appreciated the significance of the information in its possession that
    constituted a policy violation. Despite this information, it elected to defend
    the claim. The insured relied to its detriment on the insurer’s agreement to
    defend the claim. As such, the insurer was estopped from relying on a policy
    breach and was required to defend the claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge did not address
    the issue of estoppel, as he found that RSA had waived its right to rely on the
    policy breach. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I find RSA is not estopped from asserting a
    breach of the policy, as, for the reasons set out above, RSA had no knowledge
    of the breach until 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, there was no evidence of detrimental
    reliance. The claim was issued in May 2008, the statement of defence was filed
    in March 2009, and the evidence as to alcohol consumption came to light in June
    2009. Two weeks after discovering the evidence of alcohol consumption, RSA took
    an “off-coverage” position. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>RSA expended time, effort and money to
    investigate and defend the action until July 2009. There is no evidence that
    any of the steps taken by RSA to defend the case operated to prejudice the
    estate. On the contrary, the litigation administrator for the estate and
    Caton’s counsel agreed there was no difference in the defence of the action
    whether RSA added itself as a statutory third party or was a defendant in the
    action. Thus, even if Bradfield’s submission is that prejudice is presumed was
    correct, that presumption has been rebutted and I find no detrimental reliance
    in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I find RSA is not estopped
