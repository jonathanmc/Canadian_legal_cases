lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal concerns a freedom of religion challenge
    to the medical criteria accepted by Ontarios common law and legislation to
    determine that a person has died. More particularly, it is about the end of
    Taquisha McKittys life, her familys attempt to honour what they understood to
    be her religious commitments, and whether there is a duty on others to
    accommodate the demands placed on Ms. McKitty by her own religious conscience.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would uphold the application judges ultimate
    conclusion that Ms. McKittys claim, as brought by her substitute
    decision-makers, cannot succeed. I would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal. However,
    for the benefit of parties to future cases of this nature, these reasons
    explain the analytical approach that should have been followed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Determining when a person has died usually presents
    no difficulty. It is most often obvious  even to a lay person  when a person has
    taken her final breath, and her heart has stopped beating irreversibly. Total brain
    death, and the death of every living cell, typically follows shortly thereafter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But in circumstances where a patient has been
    maintained on a mechanical ventilator and during that time has suffered total
    brain death, things are more complicated. With mechanical assistance, the heart
    and lungs can keep oxygenating the body even after the brain has entirely
    ceased functioning and can no longer direct the heart and lungs. Where
    mechanical ventilation is provided, organs can continue to perform their
    ordinary functions. Cells can continue to grow. The body remains capable of
    fighting off infection and healing wounds.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Notwithstanding that a human body can continue
    this degree of functioning, there is a consensus in Canadian medical practice
    that if total brain death (or neurologically determined death) has occurred,
    the human person has died. The common law definition is the same: death has
    occurred where there is either an irreversible loss of cardiorespiratory
    function or total loss of neurological function. Although there is no Ontario legislation
    that prescribes a definition of death, several statutes are clearly premised on
    this definition. </span></p>

    establish the death of those persons who hold a religious belief that life does
    not end until the heart stops beating (with or without mechanical assistance)
    violates such persons religious freedom. The appellant asserted a religious
    obligation not to acquiesce in the removal of life support as long as her heart

    Network Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.20, which authorizes post-mortem organ
    transplants, expressly provides that the fact of death shall be determined

    state has an obligation to define death through law, and that the common law rule
    as formulated by the application judge is an abdication: it allows the medical
    profession an unfettered licence to set the criteria for death. In oral
    submissions, counsel argued that this passive stance could allow the medical
    profession to liberalize the definition of death to include not only persons
    who have suffered total brain death, but also persons with functioning, but
    severely compromised brains (e.g. the minimally conscious). Counsel argues that
    by deferring to current medical practice rather than making a definitive declaration
    of what constitutes death, courts have abdicated the responsibility to ensure
    that the benefit of the law extends to the most vulnerable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is a serious concern. Nevertheless, it
    rests on a misunderstanding of the relevant common law rule. The criteria for
    determining whether death has occurred is not a technical question that is
    indefeasibly the province of the medical profession, to which the common law must
    defer. The two criteria for death have not been accepted by the common law
    because medical practice is determinative, but because they have been judged by
    the common law to provide a sound answer to the question of how to determine whether
    a person has died. Although contemporary medical practice accepts total brain
    death as a specific criterion that allows physicians to declare a patient to be
    dead, it does not follow that should a different medical practice emerge  for example
    if physicians were to accept that persons who are minimally conscious meet the
    medical definition of death  that the common law would be obliged to accept
    this as well.</span></p>

    or even primarily, a medical or biological question. The question of who the
    law recognizes as a human being  entitled to all of the benefits and
    protections of the law  cannot be answered by medical knowledge alone. Facts
    about the physiology of the brain-dead patient are needed to determine what
    obligations are owed to the brain-dead patient, but the enquiry is not
    ultimately technical or scientific: it is evaluative. Who the common law ought
    to regard as a human being  a bearer of legal rights  is inescapably a
    question of justice, informed but not ultimately determined by current medical
    practice, bioethics, moral philosophy, and other disciplines. </span></p>

    not that the common laws acceptance of total brain death as a criterion of

    that the appellant had died. Second, she argued in the alternative that the

lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants central submission is that the
    common laws acceptance of neurological determination of death (and the legislatures
    implicit reliance on it in statutes such as the <em>Vital Statistics Act</em> and <em>Trillium Gift of Life Network Act</em>), without providing
    accommodation for religious communities that reject total brain death as
    constitutive of death, violates the appellants <em>Charter</em> rights. The
    appellant argues that, to be compliant with the <em>Charter</em>, the common
    law definition of death must be modified by a legal proposition: where a
    persons religious beliefs preclude acceptance of the neurological determination
    of death, death should be determined only according to cardiorespiratory
    criteria. The result would be that with respect to such persons, until such
    time as the heart stops beating, whether unassisted or through the use of a
    mechanical ventilator, a physician would be precluded from diagnosing or
    certifying death, and the person would remain entitled to the full protection
    and benefit of the law.</span></p>

    a human being remain a subject of <em>Charter</em> rights after total brain
    death? The application judges conclusion was no, but the reasoning was in
    error. As explained below, on the exceptional facts of this case, it is
    appropriate to assume the appellant is a subject of <em>Charter</em> rights.
    Where an appellants status as a subject of <em>Charter</em> rights depends on
    the outcome of the substantive <em>Charter</em> rights claim, it is appropriate
    to assume for the purposes of the analysis that the appellant is a subject of <em>Charter</em> rights and proceed to address the substantive question. If the religious
    freedom argument is successful, then she remains a legal person. If it fails,
    she does not. However, as explained below, it is ultimately not possible on
    this appeal to resolve the substantive <em>Charter</em> rights issue: this case
    lacks a record that would allow for a s. 1 analysis as to whether the limit
    placed on the exercise of the right is reasonable. Nevertheless, it is
    necessary to address the application judges methodological approach to resolving
    the appellants status, which was substantially in error. </span></p>

    concluded there could have been no intention to include corporations within the

    the rights to life, liberty, and security of the person are premised on bodily existence.
    An artificial entity is physically incapable of exercising these rights. The
    application judge concluded analogously, and by drawing on <em>Tremblay v. Daigle</em>,
    [1989] 2 S.C.R. 530, that because the appellant was not able to exercise any of
    these rights and freedoms, she could not come within the meaning of everyone

    physical or mental impairment, have little or no present ability to exercise many,
    if not most, of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the <em>Charter</em>.
    These impairments have no bearing on their status as subjects of <em>Charter</em> rights. Furthermore, at least some of the <em>Charter</em> rights protect not
    only ones interest in doing, but simply in <em>being</em>. The rights govern
    how one is to be treated by others. These include, for example, the right not
    to be deprived of life and the right to equal benefit of the law. </span></p>

    has died according to neurological criteria but not cardiovascular criteria 
    and who asserts that her <em>Charter</em> rights preclude the application of

    death. The text of the <em>Charter</em> is entirely silent on the matter. Neither

    death as a criterion of death; (2) the framers of the <em>Charter</em> would

lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are three problems with this analysis. First,
    the <em>Charter</em> does not confer legal personality. That is not one of its
    functions. The <em>Charter</em> confers constitutional rights on certain
    categories of persons (e.g. everyone or every citizen), but it does not
    address who is a person. Who is recognized as a legal person under Canadian law
    is determined by common law and statute. Those determinations are subject to
    review for their consistency with <em>Charter</em> rights, but it is an error
    to draw any inference about the constitutionality of the concept of brain death
    from the fact that the <em>Charter</em> does not specifically address it. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, where a common law rule is relied on in
    order to perform a government function, the common law rule is subject to <em>Charter </em>rights: <em>Halpern v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, (2003) 65 O.R. (3d)
    161 (C.A.). The mere fact that the common law rule predated the <em>Charter</em>,
    and the framers of the <em>Charter</em> may have been aware of it and showed no
    intention to change it, is not determinative that the rule is consistent with <em>Charter </em>rights.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the methodology used by the application
    judge has been consistently rejected in constitutional adjudication since at
    least the <em>Persons Case</em>: <em>Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>,
    [1930] 1 D.L.R. 98 (P.C.). In the <em>Persons Case</em>, the Supreme Court reasoned
    in a fashion similar to the application judge, finding that the term qualified
    persons (those eligible for appointment to the Senate) in s. 24 of the <em>Constitution
    Act, 1867</em> could not include women because the common law at the time did
    not permit the appointment of women to public office and it could not have been
    the intention of the framers of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> to change
    the common law by making women eligible for appointment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In overturning the Supreme Court, the Privy
    Council was similarly focused on what had (and had not) been settled by the
    adoption of the constitutional text: the question is not what may be supposed
    to have been intended, but what has been said: <em>Persons Case</em>, at p. 107,
    citing <em>Brophy v. Attorney General (Manitoba)</em>, [1895] A.C. 202 (P.C.). Faced
    with an ambiguity in the text as to whether persons indicated male persons only
    or male and female persons, the Privy Council applied a presumption in favour
    of the more inclusive meaning, concluding that the text should be read as
    including male and female persons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the application judge was here required
    to interpret general terms (everyone or every individual). Uncontroversially,
    the ordinary meaning of these terms exclude persons who have died. But the
    terms themselves, read in context, say nothing whatsoever about the criteria to
    be used to determine death. In circumstances such as these, where a common law
    rule that limits access to the protections of the <em>Charter</em> is the very
    law whose constitutionality is impugned, the methodology of the <em>Persons
    Case</em> suggests that we apply a presumption of membership in the class (everyone)
    who is to benefit from the <em>Charter</em>, for the limited purpose of assessing
    the substantive <em>Charter</em> claim that purportedly establishes membership
    in the class. Denying the opportunity to make the argument, on the basis of a criterion
    whose constitutionality is the subject of the litigation, begs the question
    that is in dispute. </span></p>

    as a government agent: <em>R. v. Buhay</em>, 2003 SCC 30, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at
    para. 25. It is not sufficient that he be carrying out some purpose that is

    [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, at p. 269. The appellant has not established that the
    respondent was performing a governmental function or acting as a government
    agent. The respondent does not, therefore, owe any duties to the appellant

    that statute is in some way unconstitutional: <em>M. v. H.</em>, [1999] 2 S.C.R.

    enacted under the <em>Vital Statistics Act</em>, which requires physicians to complete
    a medical certificate of death consequent to diagnosing someone as having died.

    for the first time on this moot appeal. The main issue before the application
    judge was the continuation of the appellants medical treatment. The constitutional
    status of the <em>Vital Statistics Act</em>, and the nature of a physicians
    responsibilities under the <em>Act</em>, would be better left to a future case

    change to the common law. The distinction between these two bases for changing
    the law was explained in <em>Hill v. Church of Scientology</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R.
    1130, at paras. 93-95: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When determining how the <em>Charter</em> applies

    private litigation the analysis which applies in cases involving government
    action.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Dolphin Delivery</em>  it was noted
    that the <em>Charter</em> sets out those specific constitutional duties which
    the state owes to its citizens. When government action is challenged, whether
    it is based on legislation or the common law, the cause of action is founded
    upon a <em>Charter</em> right. The claimant alleges that the state has breached

    appellants s. 2(a) rights have been limited is better left, however, to a case
    with a more developed record. Neither would it be appropriate here to assume a first-stage
    finding that a <em>Charter</em> right has been <em>limited</em>, for the
    purpose of continuing with a second-stage inquiry into whether a <em>Charter</em> right has been <em>violated</em>. A finding of a <em>Charter</em> rights
    violation, where the limit in question is prescribed by law, can only be made
    after a s. 1 inquiry in which it is determined that the limit is not justified.
    Justification of a limit requires that a court consider the reasons for the
    limitation. The proper party to supply those reasons and defend the limitation
    is, in this case, the Attorney General for Ontario. As that party was not
    before the court, there is no record that would allow for an assessment of the

    question of the appellants religious beliefs was sparse. The only evidence of the
    appellants religious beliefs came from the fourth affidavit of Mr. Stewart
    (the appellants father), sworn on November 5, 2017, and his cross-examination
    on that affidavit.</span></p>

    lifelong Christian who attended a Baptist church when with him and her
    grandparents, and a Seventh-day Adventist church when with her mothers side of
    the family.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Her father stated that the appellant made clear
    to him that she wanted to have her life preserved, including through life
    support measures, so long as her heart was beating. He attributed her
    opposition to the withdrawal of life support to what he characterized as a Christian
    theology: [her] world view and belief has always been that it is not the
    brain, but the beating heart that determines and is essential to life. The
    rejection of brain death as a criterion for death was characterized by him as
    prescribed by her Christian beliefs and faith; it would be against [her]
    fundamental and express religious beliefs to withdraw mechanical ventilation,
    and to allow the determination of her death by neurological criteria to stand.
    Accordingly, he asserted that cessation of life support while her heart was
    still beating would be a wrongful taking of life  it would be murder. It would
    be just as wrong for her to acquiesce in her killing (and for her substitute
    decision-maker to do so for her).</span></p>

    why he believed the appellant shared his understanding of this particular religious
    norm, he replied:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Well, I would say that because that is one,
    was the [view] that I was raised on, that life begins with conception, and life
    ends up when your heart stops beating, and your soul leave[s] your body. Thats
    the  thats the context of, I was taught as a, as a young man growing up from
    my family. And thats the same value system that Ive passed down to my four
    children, and my granddaughter as well. So, growing up, that would be the way
    that I would have instructed my children, or taught them in, in relation to
    life and death.</span></p>

    appellants religious beliefs been more fully developed. There was, for
    example, no evidence as to whether the religious beliefs propounded by Mr.
    Stewart on the appellants behalf were understood to be universally held by
    Christians, unique to particular Christian denominations such as Baptist and
    Seventh-day Adventist, or idiosyncratic to the appellant and her family. The
    freedom of religion guarantee, of course, does not depend on whether ones
    religious beliefs are shared by ones coreligionists or indeed by anyone else: <em>Amselem</em>,
    at para. 54. A claimant is under no obligation to provide any evidence that
    these beliefs are held by others. But where, as here, a rights claimant
    professes membership in a particular religious community, it can be helpful if there
    is some evidence before the court as to the beliefs of that community, simply
    to help the judge understand what the claimant believes. Even where the rights
    claimant dissents from the beliefs of her community in some respect, the
    community teachings or precepts can serve as a point of contrast to bring the
    claimants beliefs into sharper focus. Here, for example, the appellants end-of-life
    ethics might have been clarified by contrast with the principle of inviolability
    or sanctity of life (itself incorporated into the common law, and later modified
    in cases such as <em>Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General)</em>,
    [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519 and <em>Carter v. Canada (Attorney General), </em>2015 SCC
    5, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 331) that although one may never intentionally take the life

    Ktunaxa. The claim was that the development would remove the basis of [the

    Supreme Court majority understood the Ktunaxa to be seeking to protect the
    presence of Grizzly Bear Spirit in Qatmuk. As such, it characterized the
    claim as a matter of using s. 2(a) to protect the object of beliefs and the spiritual

    a human being remains alive until such time as his or her heart stops beating. Second,
    there is a divinely instituted and exceptionless moral norm that one must never
    intentionally kill a human person, including self-killing and acquiescing in
    ones own killing. Third, ending life support of a person whose brain is dead
    but heart is beating constitutes intentional killing of a human person. Fourth,
    to breach this norm against killing (including acquiescing in ones own

    tenets of her religious faith  to be determined by whether her heart was
    beating. Insisting that she be recognized as a living human person who is
    entitled to all the benefits of law and membership in a political community is
    a manifestation of that religious belief. </span></p>

    more than trivial or insubstantial with the ability to manifest that belief: <em>Trinity
    Western</em>, at para. 63; <em>Amselem</em>, at para. 65. Although the record
    is sparse, I would conclude that it is sufficient to establish that the

    is no methodology to guide the degree of abstraction at which they are

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There are sound reasons supporting this
    judicial reluctance to dramatically recast established rules of law. The court
    may not be in the best position to assess the deficiencies of the existing law,
    much less problems which may be associated with the changes it might make. The
    court has before it a single case; major changes in the law should be
    predicated on a wider view of how the rule will operate in the broad generality
    of cases. Moreover, the court may not be in a position to appreciate fully the
    economic and policy issues underlying the choice it is asked to make. Major
    changes to the law often involve devising subsidiary rules and procedures
    relevant to their implementation, a task which is better accomplished through
    consultation between courts and practitioners than by judicial decree. Finally,
    and perhaps most importantly, there is the long-established principle that in a
    constitutional democracy it is the legislature, as the elected branch of
    government, which should assume the major responsibility for law reform.</span></p>

    that the constraints on the power of the judiciary to change the law are no
    different where the reason for the change is to better align the common law with <em>Charter</em> values or other moral norms. Courts have traditionally been
    cautious regarding the extent to which they will amend the common law.
    Similarly, they must not go further than is necessary when taking <em>Charter</em> values into account. Far-reaching changes to the common law must be left to the
    legislature: <em>Hill</em>, at para. 96. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even where it would be appropriate  according
    to the criteria articulated in <em>Watkins</em> and <em>Hill </em><em> </em>for
    a judge to amend the common law, a judge who seeks to be guided by <em>Charter</em> values and thereby avoid idiosyncrasy faces the hidden traps mentioned above:
    (1) the problem of identifying or choosing <em>Charter</em> values; and (2) the
    problem of prioritizing particular <em>Charter</em> values against other
    considerations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, there is no set list of <em>Charter</em> values, or canonical formulation of them. The category of <em>Charter</em> values is extremely broad, including human goods derived from the enumerated
    rights and freedoms, from s. 1s principles of a free and democratic society,
    and entailments from even more abstract principles, such as human dignity, as
    in <em>Hill</em>, at para. 120. So a judge who would rely on <em>Charter</em> values in common law reasoning must not only select some values from among
    others, but must formulate them at an appropriate level of abstraction. The
    Supreme Court has provided some guidance in this regard.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The methodology for applying <em>Charter</em> values in common law reasoning has been most fully developed in cases addressing
    the moral norms associated with freedom of expression: see e.g. <em>Grant v.
    Torstar Corp.</em>, 2009 SCC 61, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 640; <em>Dagenais v. Canadian
    Broadcasting Corp., </em>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 835; and <em>Hill</em>. The first step
    in the methodology applied in those cases was to identify the core rationales
    or purposes behind the adoption of the <em>Charter</em> right  that is, those aspects
    of human flourishing the <em>Charter </em>right is intended to promote. In the
    case of s. 2(b), the underlying purpose has been characterized as a matter of
    furthering democratic discourse, truth-finding, and self-fulfillment: <em>Irwin
    Toy</em>, at p. 976.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having considered why and how the constitutional
    provision in question furthers human well-being, the second step is to consider
    whether the impugned common law rule (in the s. 2(b) cases, often the law of
    defamation and its defences) adequately promotes or protects these goods, when
    considered alongside competing goods. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the context of a proposal to change a common
    law rule where freedom of religion is of concern, an appeal to the <em>Charter</em> values corresponding to freedom of religion must therefore be a deeper inquiry
    than simply reading off the text of the <em>Charter</em>. It requires an
    account, similar to that provided in the context of freedom of expression in <em>Irwin
    Toy</em>, of the human goods served by protecting the right. Without this, it would
    be difficult to engage in the appropriate reconciliation of principle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to weight or priority, although
    what has been characterized as a <em>Charter</em> value may be significant to
    judicial reasoning, it does not have indefeasible priority over competing
    considerations: <em>Gehl</em>, at paras. 78-82. Although a fully specified <em>Charter</em> right (that is, a right whose limitation has been found to have been justified
    under s. 1) operates as a trump, a <em>Charter</em> value does not.
    Accordingly, in common law reasoning, it may be that little turns on whether a
    reason for modifying the common law is characterized as a <em>Charter</em> value or not. What matters is the salience of the reason for changing the law
    and not the label that is attached to it: <em>E.T. v. Hamilton</em>, at para.
    104.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The application judges formulation of the relevant <em>Charter</em> value was stated in terms of s. 2(a): the value protected by s. 2(a) is the
    right to hold religious beliefs and manifest those beliefs without fear or
    coercion. This formulation, however, is simply a restatement of the scope of
    the <em>Charter</em> right and is not adequate. As in <em>Grant</em>, <em>Dagenais</em>,
    and <em>Hill</em>, to get to a principle it is necessary to ask what reason there
    is to respect conscientious religious beliefs and acts of persons. It is
    necessary to explain how the manifestation of the particular religious belief
    in question is important from the perspective of the claimant: a person who
    engages in religious practice in order to understand truths about the world.
    This would involve an analysis of the type outlined in paragraphs 59-62 above,
    in the discussion of s. 2(a) rights. But the analysis is not necessarily
    restricted to principles that are directly analogous to the substantive <em>Charter</em> rights. Other salient principles would include, for example, the inviolability
    of life: <em>Rodriguez</em>, at p. 595; <em>Carter</em>, at para. 63.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The application judge also identified competing principles as <em>Charter</em> values, including a need for certainty, predictability and clarity in the law
    regarding the determination of death. In addition to these, she raised
    concerns about unjustifiably privileging some religions over others, the
    financial cost of maintaining the appellant in an intensive care unit, and the
    impact on the organ donation system. The application judge ultimately concluded
    that the consideration of all of the relevant matters of principle are beyond
    the scope of this court to consider but must be addressed if there is to be an
    accommodation of religious beliefs in the determination of death. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>As outlined above, the reasoning of the application judge, including
    the inadequate characterization of the nature of freedom of religion, the idiosyncratic
    identification of a need for certainty, predictability and clarity in the law
    regarding the determination of death as <em>Charter</em> values, and the equally
    idiosyncratic weighing of the various <em>Charter</em> values against each
    other, amply illustrates the difficulties inherent in using <em>Charter</em> values to amend the common law.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Given the deficiencies in the record, whether a common law rule should
    be crafted to provide accommodation for persons whose religious convictions
    cannot accept neurological criteria for death, is a question that must,
    ultimately, be left for another case. I would not, on this record in a moot
    appeal, attempt to determine whether such a change to the law is within the
    institutional capacity of courts to make incremental changes to the common law
    or is the type of far-reaching change that must be left to the legislature. </span></p>
