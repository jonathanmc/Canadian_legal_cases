  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Feldman J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The appellant was the purchaser under an agreement
    of purchase and sale of a residence in Mississauga. He failed to close on the
    date set for closing, received a number of extensions, but failed to close on
    any of the extended dates. The respondent vendors relisted the property and
    ultimately sold it for less than the price that the appellant had agreed to
    pay. In the action by the respondents for damages for breach of the agreement,
    the summary judgment motion judge awarded the difference in price to the
    respondent vendors, together with a number of consequential loss items. She
    also ordered that the deposit of $75,000 paid by the appellant purchaser be
    forfeited and not credited toward the damage award.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On this appeal, the appellant’s position is that
    the motion judge erred by failing to find that the respondents are not entitled
    to any damages because they failed to tender properly and were not ready,
    willing and able to close, and by finding that the respondents reasonably
    mitigated their damages. He also says that the motion judge erred by failing to
    credit the forfeited deposit toward the damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal on the deposit issue only. The amount of the forfeited deposit must be
    credited toward the damage award.</span></p>

    19, 2017 during a very “hot” real estate market in the Greater Toronto Area.
    They listed the property at $1,398,000, received multiple offers, and accepted
    the appellant’s offer of $1,555,000 on March 27, 2017 to close on June 28,
    2017. The appellant paid a deposit of $75,000. </span></p>

    a new home near Hamilton, Ontario for $1,375,000 to close on June 1, 2017. They
    took out a bridge loan to complete that purchase and conduct some renovations
    on the new home.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On May 30, 2017, the respondents’ real estate
    lawyer, Mr. John Peter Ferreira, received a requisition letter and other
    documents from Mr. Joshua David, as the appellant’s real estate lawyer, which
    he answered the following day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On June 19, 2017, Mr. Ferreira sent Mr. David a
    closing package by courier. However, on June 26, 2017, two days before the date
    set for closing, Mr. Ferreira received a call from Ms. Sarah Razzouk, who
    advised that she was taking over from Mr. David and would be representing the
    appellant on the purchase. On the same day, Ms. Razzouk wrote to Mr. Ferreira
    requesting an extension of the closing until July 7, 2017 and advising that she
    would pick up the closing package from Mr. David’s office.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On June 28, 2017, Ms. Razzouk sent another letter
    requesting a further extension to July 10, 2017. On June 29, 2017, Ms. Razzouk
    sent a requisition letter to Mr. Ferreira together with some vendor documents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On July 1, 2017, the respondents agreed to extend
    the closing to July 10, 2017, on the condition that the appellant pay the
    interest on their mortgage, line of credit and bridge loan. These terms were
    accepted in a letter from Ms. Razzouk.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>On July 7, 2017, Mr. Ferreira faxed to Ms. Razzouk a revised statement
    of adjustments, a direction and a request for an update on the status of the
    closing. On July 10, 2017, Ms. Razzouk faxed a message that stated: “please be
    advised that I do not have mortgage instructions as of yet. As such we will require
    an extension until July 13, 2017.” She sent a follow-up fax later in the day
    indicating that she did not have instructions and: “[a]s of yet I do not know
    when. Client is not communicating with us anymore.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Mr. Ferreira made an offer on behalf of the respondents to extend the
    closing date to July 13, 2017, on terms that included payment of the
    respondents’ costs and a further $75,000 deposit to be received by 4:00 pm on
    July 11, 2017, failing which the appellant would be deemed to be in breach of
    the agreement. No response was received to this offer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>On the appellant’s side, he applied for a mortgage at both TD Bank and
    Scotiabank but was declined. He then advised his real estate agent that he
    would not be able to purchase the property. The motion judge noted that the
    appellant claimed that he was contacted by ICICI Bank to advise that they were
    investigating a mortgage fraud. He alleges that the mortgage agent working with
    his real estate agent had submitted fraudulent documents to apply for a mortgage
    in his name, and that ICICI Bank had advised him that he would be participating
    in the fraud if he obtained a mortgage from any institution where fraudulent
    documents had been submitted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>After the purchase did not close on July 10, the respondents re-listed
    the property for sale at the original list price of $1,398.000. As the
    respondents had moved to their new home, their old home was empty and had to be
    staged for showing purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>On July 27, 2017, Mr. Ferreira received a letter dated July 24, 2017
    from a lawyer, Mr. Constantine, that stated he was acting for the appellant and
    that the appellant had received a mortgage approval from the CIBC. However, he
    wanted a 10% reduction in the purchase price based on an appraisal of the
    property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Mr. Ferreira responded on August 11, 2017, requesting the appellant’s
    position on a potential resolution of the matter. No response was received. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>On September 5, 2017, the respondents lowered the list price to
    $1,349,000, and on September 6, 2017, they entered into a conditional agreement
    of purchase and sale with a new purchaser, which was confirmed on September 15,
    2017, for the price of $1,280,000 to close on November 15, 2017.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The decision of the motion judge</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The motion judge identified the following four issues: did the
    appellant breach the agreement? If so, what damages are the respondents
    entitled to? Is the deposit forfeited to the respondents? Is the appellant
    entitled to relief from forfeiture?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The appellant’s position was that he was unable to close because of fraudulent
    activity perpetrated in his name by the mortgage broker who worked with his real
    estate agent. The appellant also denied that he retained either Mr. David or
    Ms. Razzouk or that he applied for a mortgage to CIBC. He claimed that he
    wanted to purchase the property for cash but at a lower price. He argued that
    the alleged fraud constituted a genuine issue for trial. He also argued that
    the respondents were not ready, willing and able to close because they failed
    to tender valid, signed documents, and that they failed to mitigate their
    damages by selling the property to him at a reduced price.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The motion judge rejected the appellant’s position and found that the
    appellant breached the agreement of purchase and sale by failing to close on
    July 10, 2017, and the allegations of fraud against the mortgage broker and
    real estate agent did not excuse that failure. The motion judge also found no
    evidence that a cash offer was ever communicated to the respondents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The motion judge rejected the tender argument on a number of grounds.
    Although the tender package contained a Direction re Funds that was signed by
    Mr. Ferreira rather than by the respondents, that document could have been
    replaced with one signed by the respondents, had the appellant asked before
    closing. The appellant cannot rely on any such alleged defence when he was not
    able to close and when he was taking the position that there was no one upon
    whom to tender because the two lawyers who were communicating with Mr. Ferreira
    were not actually his lawyers. The motion judge found that the transaction did
    not close not because of any problem with the tender but because the appellant
    did not have the funds to complete the transaction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>On the issue of the quantum of damages, the motion judge stated the
    rule from <em>Goldstein v. Goldar</em>, 2018 ONSC 608, at para. 25, as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The damages amount will be the difference
    between the price under the Agreement and the price of the new sale of the
    property once it closes, plus any additional carrying costs incurred by the
    Vendor in mitigating her loss and dealing with the Purchasers’ breach</span><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:10.5pt;color:#212121'>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The difference between the agreed price and the ultimate sale price was
    $275,000. The motion judge also awarded damages for the cost of the staging,
    legal fees, carrying costs of the property and interest on the line of credit,
    for a total of $308,688.31. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>On the issue of mitigation, the motion judge found that the respondents
    took reasonable steps to mitigate. After they re-listed the property, they did
    not accept the first offer but held out for a higher price and were able to
    obtain one.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The final issue was the disposition of the deposit. The agreement of
    purchase and sale included the standard preprinted form language providing that
    the deposit was “to be held in trust pending completion or other termination of
    this Agreement and to be credited towards the Purchase Price on completion.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Because the agreement was not completed, the questions were whether the
    deposit was to be forfeited to the respondents in addition to the damages, and
    was the appellant entitled to relief from forfeiture. The motion judge found
    that the deposit was forfeited but not to be credited against the damages owed.
    She then considered whether the appellant was entitled to relief from
    forfeiture and concluded that he was not. She therefore ordered the appellant
    to pay the damages plus forfeit the deposit. </span></p>

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN style='color:black'>The renunciation of a
    contract may be express or implied. A party to a contract may state before the
    time for performance that he will not, or cannot, perform his obligations. This
    is tantamount to an express renunciation. On the other hand a renunciation will
    be implied if the conduct of a party is such as to lead a reasonable person to
    the conclusion that he will not perform, or will not be able to perform, when
    the time for performance arises.</span></p>

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN style='color:black'>Tender … is not a
    prerequisite to the innocent party enforcing his or her contractual rights.
    Tender is not required from an innocent party when the other party has clearly
    repudiated the agreement. Numerous cases have held that the law does not
    require what would be a meaningless or futile gesture. Moreover, when there is
    an anticipatory breach, the innocent party need not wait to the date for
    performance before commencing proceedings for damages or in the alternative for
    specific performance of the agreement. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>

lang=EN>In oral submissions, the appellant argued in the alternative that even

    damages because they never elected to either accept the repudiation or to
    insist on performance. The appellant cited <em>1179 Hunt Club Inc. v. Ottawa
    Medical Square Inc.</em>,<i> </i>2018 ONSC 6200, in support of the proposition
    that the innocent party must elect. As that case was under appeal at the time,

    date, and then neither party was able to close on that date. As a result, the
    agreement was at an end and the purchaser was entitled to the return of the
    deposit. In this case, the vendor was ready, willing and able to close. It was
    the purchaser’s lawyer who advised that the purchaser did not have the funds to

lang=EN>The appellant complains that the respondents did not entertain the

lang=EN>Second, it is unclear how this argument assists the appellant. His
    position in Mr. Constantine’s letter and in this action, was that he was
    seeking a 10% price reduction based on an appraisal of the property – not that
    he would pay the reduced price and also continue to be obligated under the
    original agreement for the difference. Unless the respondents agreed to sell to
    the appellant for a 10% reduction, and at the same time released him from his
    obligation to pay the original price, the respondents could still sue the
    appellant for the difference.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>However, even if the appellant had made an offer to pay 10% less for
    the property and not be released from his obligation under the agreement of
    purchase and sale, I would reject the suggestion that the duty to mitigate
    obliges a vendor to accept an offer from the defaulting purchaser for less than
    the agreed price and then to have to sue the purchaser for the difference from
    the original agreed price.</span></p>

    have been avoided: S.M. Waddams, <em>The Law of Contracts</em><i>, </i>7th ed.
    (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2017), at p. 529. It cannot be reasonable for a
    vendor to be obliged to reduce the loss it claims from the defaulting party by
    reselling the property to that party, then suing him or her for the difference.
    This would offer no financial advantage to the defaulting party as that party would
    be obliged to pay the same amount, either way. Yet the defaulting party would secure
    a significant tactical and procedural advantage over the innocent vendor.</span></p>

    default, particularly in a falling market, and to offer a lower price for the
    same property, leaving vendors with the risk and expense of recovering the
    balance of the original contract price in an action. The duty to mitigate does

    of a contract to be that in the event of the contract being performed it shall
    be brought into account, but if the contract is not performed by the payer it
    shall remain the property of the payee. It is not merely a part payment, but is

    obligation owed by the purchaser defendant to the vendor plaintiffs on
    completion of the transaction. There is no difference to the use of the deposit
    in the event of termination of the agreement as opposed to its successful
    completion. Rather, it was intended to be applied as a credit to the obligation
    owed by the purchaser to the vendors: whatever form that obligation might take.
    I conclude that the $35,000 paid by the purchaser defendant is to be paid to
    the vendor plaintiffs and credited against the damages that they have proven</span></p>

lang=EN>I agree with this analysis. While the agreement only specifically calls
    for the deposit to be credited to the purchase price on completion of the
    agreement, the measure of damages is based on the difference between the
    purchase price and the lesser amount that the property sold for after the
    purchaser’s default. In other words, it is based on the vendor receiving the
    purchase price that was bargained for. One can infer that the intent of the
    parties was that the deposit be applied to the purchase price whether received
    on completion or as damages. </span></p>

lang=EN>I also agree that the cases discussed above, including <em>Benedetto</em>,
    where the deposit is forfeited because it is not just part payment but also a
    security mechanism to incentivize the purchaser to complete the transaction,
    explain why the deposit is forfeited when the vendor suffers no loss. The
    respondents point to one sentence in the <em>Benedetto</em> decision where the
    court states that “a forfeited deposit does not constitute damages for breach
    of contract but stands as security for the performance of the contract”: at
    para. 14. That statement is part of the explanation for the forfeiture of the
    deposit where there is no loss. However, where there is a loss, the deposit is
    treated as part payment for the damages suffered as a result of the loss.</span></p>

lang=EN>I would dismiss the appeal on the issues respecting the appellant’s
    breach of the agreement of purchase and sale, and the issue of mitigation, but
    allow the appeal on the quantum of damages by deducting the amount of the
    deposit, $75,000, from the damages award.</span></p>
