  <p class=Heard>Heard: October 16, 2019</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Matthew
    C. Webber of the Ontario Court of Justice on April 12, 2017.</p>
  <p class=Endorsment>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. The complainant was the
    daughter of cottage neighbours of the appellant and his wife. The complainant
    became close with the appellant and his wife, socializing with them, and in
    particular, drinking with them. The appellant was 53, the complainant 21 at the
    time of the offence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant became infatuated with the complainant and invited her to
    meet him at a motel. He planned a sexual encounter with her. He stocked the
    motel room with liquor, knowing the complainant liked to drink. He had rose
    petals strewn on the bed. She began to drink as soon as she got there. As the
    night progressed, she continued to drink and began to feel very intoxicated. He
    made a number of advances which she diverted. Her blouse was removed, and the
    appellant kissed her, licked her breast, and bit her buttocks. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His position was that the encounter was consensual and that he honestly
    believed she was consenting. Her position was that she did not consent to
    anything he did, that she was semi-conscious or in and out of consciousness the
    whole time. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually he noticed that she was “too relaxed” and asked her if she
    was falling asleep on him. At that point she jumped up, grabbed her clothes,
    called her neighbour Ms. C to come and pick her up and ran outside to wait. When
    Ms. C. arrived, she was so concerned about how intoxicated and sick the
    complainant was that she took her to the hospital but she was released. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because the appellant continued to email the complainant and threaten
    her in the days following the incident, she eventually went to the police to
    report the sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In oral argument, counsel for the appellant focused on two main grounds
    of appeal. The first was that the trial judge failed to give the appellant, who
    was self-represented at the trial, adequate assistance in his conduct of the
    trial and of his defence, by cutting off an avenue of cross-examination of one
    of the Crown witnesses, Ms. C. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had asked Ms. C, who had experience in hypnotherapy, if
    she had ever hypnotized the complainant between the time of the incident and
    the time she went to the police and Ms. C answered: no. The appellant then
    asked the trial judge if he could go on to ask if she had hypnotized the
    complainant since that time. The appellant explained that he wanted to explore
    the possibility of collusion. The trial judge disallowed the question. He told
    the appellant that collusion was not an issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that there was an air of reality to the possibility
    that the complainant was influenced by Ms. C, who had very negative attitudes
    toward sexual assault and who had a significant interaction with her after the
    offence. Then in his reasons for judgment the trial judge praised Ms. C and
    accepted her evidence in its entirety, in particular regarding the
    complainant’s state of intoxication when she picked her up, which was the key
    to the rejection of the appellant’s version of what occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well accepted that the trial judge has a duty to assist an
    unrepresented accused to understand the issues and to conduct his defence,
    while all the while maintaining his impartiality. As this court recently stated
    in <em>R. v. Forrester</em>, 2019 ONCA 255, 375 C.C.C. (3d) 279, the scope of
    that duty depends on the circumstances of the case and is circumscribed by what
    is reasonable: at para. 15 The court also stated at para. 16: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>A trial judge, of course, has
    other duties, one of which is to ensure that the trial is effective, efficient
    and fair to both sides: <em>R. v. John</em>, 2017 ONCA 622, 350 C.C.C. (3d)
    397, at para. 47; and <em>R. v. Snow</em><i> </i>(2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 40
    (C.A.), at para. 24. This includes ensuring that the trial does not become
    mired in irrelevant evidence and that the rules of evidence are applied fairly
    to both parties.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge lived up to his obligations in this case. The
    trial judge allowed the appellant to ask Ms. C whether she had hypnotized the
    complainant before she went to the police and gave her statement about what she
    says occurred with the appellant. The answer was no. There was little if any
    relevance to their interactions after that. Furthermore, counsel appointed by
    the court to cross-examine the complainant had questioned the complainant
    regarding any discussions she had had with Ms. C, and put to her that she only
    went to the police because Ms. C told her that she had been sexually assaulted.
    The complainant responded “no”. Therefore any air of reality to that suggestion
    within a relevant time period was explored and denied. There was no unfairness
    or prejudice from the trial judge’s ruling.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second issue counsel focused on in oral argument was whether the trial
    judge failed to provide sufficient reasons regarding the appellant’s position
    that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The submission was that
    the trial judge erred by failing to make a finding whether he believed the
    appellant or had a reasonable doubt when he said that the complainant removed
    her own blouse and returned his kiss, substantiating his belief in consent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree. The trial judge made the finding that the complainant was
    intoxicated and semi-conscious, to the knowledge of the appellant, and
    therefore knew that she was not willingly consenting to sexual contact. He also
    found that she did not consent. We see no error in his approach or his finding.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant submitted in his factum that the trial judge
    erred in misapprehending certain pieces of evidence which he says, when
    combined with other errors committed by the trial judge, resulted in an
    unreasonable verdict. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On this record, it cannot be said that the verdict was unreasonable or
    unsupported by the evidence. There was evidence before the trial judge, which
    he accepted, that was capable of supporting a conviction. Even with our ability
    to engage in a limited weighing of this evidence on appeal, it does not alter
    this conclusion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended any
    evidence that played an essential role in his reasoning process. In a number of
    instances, the appellant’s complaint really boils down to a disagreement with
    the trial judge’s interpretation of various pieces of evidence, or the
    inferences that he drew from them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, the appellant claims that the trial judge erred in finding
    that the complainant’s understanding of the state of being “unconscious” did
    not authentically describe that state. We disagree. The evidence as a whole
    provided an ample basis upon which the trial judge could find that, due to
    extreme intoxication, the complaint’s mental state was incompatible with
    consent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was entitled to consider the fact that the complainant’s
    call to Ms. C to pick her up was some evidence of a lack of consent to the
    activity that had just occurred. Although the complainant testified that she
    had never intended to stay at the motel with the appellant in the first place,
    she also testified that she usually took taxis. Consequently, the trial judge
    was entitled to use this evidence as he did. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in reasoning
    that the complainant’s extreme intoxication when she was picked-up by Ms. C
    suggested that she was extremely intoxicated during her time in the hotel room.
    We disagree. Again, this was one piece of evidence from which the trial judge
    came to the conclusion that the complainant was severely intoxicated at the
    time of the sexual activity with the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s other complaints are similar in nature. The trial judge
