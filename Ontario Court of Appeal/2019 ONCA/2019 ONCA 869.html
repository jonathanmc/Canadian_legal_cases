  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on May 8, 2017 by
    Justice Jamie Trimble of the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual interference and invitation to
    sexual touching but acquitted of sexual assault. The counts flow from three
    separate incidents involving his stepdaughter at the family home. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant denied the allegations. During his examination, defence
    counsel (not appellate counsel) asked the appellant if he was aware of why the
    complainant would “come forward and make these allegations”. The appellant
    responded that he did not know why. The Crown confronted him with a prior
    police statement in which he stated that she made up the allegations because of
    an incident involving her boyfriend and established the inconsistency. The
    appellant acknowledged the statement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown then cross-examined the appellant extensively regarding the
    complainant’s motive to fabricate generally. Specifically, the Crown asked the
    appellant:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    possible reason she would have to “make all this up”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Was
    there any reason why she would go to the police, make a statement, and come to
    court twice to testify;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    was her reason for making up the first and second incident; </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    was her motive; and,</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Why was she going to the police?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also asked the appellant: “…was there some specific
    reason, some event, something happened, that you think caused [her] to lie
    about that and make up that story back then”. The appellant responded that he
    did not remember exactly but she was being punished for something. At this
    point, the Crown continued the cross-examination about the complainant’s discipline
    and other reasons she may have had to make the allegations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred to the evidence of motive in his reasons when
    he assessed the credibility of the appellant and the complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that by allowing cross-examination on the motive
    to fabricate and then using the evidence to discredit the appellant and enhance
    the evidence of the complainant, the trial judge shifted the burden of proof
    and erred in law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept the appellant’s submission and it is not necessary to address
    the other grounds of appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that there is no onus on the accused to comment
    on the credibility of the accuser. The Crown submits, and we agree, that there
    were inconsistencies in the appellant’s prior statement which were the proper
    subject matter of cross-examination. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also submits that, in addition to the inconsistencies, the further
    questions were justified because the appellant “open[ed] the door” by raising
    the complainant’s alleged motive to fabricate of his own accord. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. The evidence the appellant gave in-chief was that he did
    not know of any reasons why the complainant would make the allegations. There were
    therefore no claimed motives that required challenge by cross-examination. The
    Crown was entitled to pursue the inconsistencies in cross-examination and to
    proceed cautiously on the appellant’s response to the question in-chief.
    However, the cross-examination went far beyond the inconsistencies and scope of
    a proper cross-examination. The Crown’s questions required the appellant to
    comment on – and indeed speculate – about the complainant’s motive, both
    generally and with respect to specific incidents. In this way, the questioning
    went directly against long-standing jurisprudence by improperly placing the
    onus on the appellant to explain why the complainant would falsely accuse him.
    This court set out the rationale for limiting the line of questioning about the
    complainant’s motives in <i>R. v. T.M</i>., 2014 ONCA 854, at paras. 37-38:  </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The appellant argues that this cross-examination was improper.
    He relies on the many decisions of this court that have held “it is improper to
    call upon an accused to comment on the credibility of his accusers”: see&nbsp;<em><span

style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>15-16</span></a>, per Simmons
    J.A.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The concern with this line of
    questioning is two-fold. First, it is unfair to ask an accused to speculate
    about a witness’s motives. Second, these questions risk shifting the burden of
    proof. The burden is on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a
    complainant’s allegations are true. Yet questions to an accused about a
    complainant’s motives may cause the trier of fact to focus on whether the
    accused can provide an explanation for why a complainant would make false
    allegations, and find the accused guilty if a credible explanation is not
    forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That defence counsel did not object to the line of questioning is not
    determinative. As this court held in <i>R. v. L.(L</i>.<i>)</i>, 2009 ONCA 413,
    96 O.R. (3d) 412, at para. 17:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span style='background:white'>Contrary
    to the submissions of the trial Crown, the fact that it may be appropriate for
    the police to ask such questions as part of an investigation does not mean that
    portions of an accused's statement in which such questions are asked are
    properly admissible. This court made that clear in <i>C.(F.).</i> In that case,
    even though no objection was raised at trial, this court held that portions of
    an accused's statement to the police asking him to explain why the complainant
    made the allegations and why some people believed the complainant should not
    have been placed before the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s reasons disclosed that he used the evidence adduced
    from the appellant on cross-examination to enhance the complainant’s
    credibility. Although he instructed himself not to equate credibility with an absence
    of motive to fabricate, he relied on the absence of motive to enhance the
    complainant’s credibility. At two different points in the reasons, the trial
    judge stated that “there is no evidence” that the complainant had any reason to
    fabricate these complaints. Moreover, he found, at para. 107:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Finally, there is no evidence that
    [the complainant] had any reason [to] fabricate these complaints against [the
    appellant]. <u>There was no ulterior motive.</u> [Emphasis added.] </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred by using the evidence to enhance his assessment of
    the complainant’s credibility. He fell into the error articulated in <i>R. v.
    Bartholomew,</i> 2019 ONCA 377, at para. 23 and “transformed” the absence of a
    proven motive to fabricate into a proven lack of motive. A proven absence of
    motive may provide a “platform to assert that the complainant must be telling
    the truth”: <i>Bartholomew</i>, at para. 21. But, the absence of evidence of
    motive does not mean that the complainant must be telling the truth.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The danger in relying on this factor to bolster the complainant’s
    credibility is that an absence of proved motive is often unreliable. This court
    has raised this concern repeatedly:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>There are simply too many reasons
    why a person might not tell the truth, most of which will be unknown except to
    the person her/himself, to use it as a foundation to enhance the witness’
    credibility. Consequently, [a motive to fabricate] is an unhelpful factor in
    assessing credibility: <i>R. v. Sanchez</i>, 2017 ONCA 994, at para. 25, citing <i>L.(L.)</i> at para. 44.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To a lesser extent, the trial judge appears to have relied on this
    evidence in evaluating the appellant’s testimony. At para. 104, the trial judge
    disbelieved the appellant’s evidence about the complainant being punished by
    saying that his explanation for the complainant’s motive “makes no sense” and
    was “vague”. Using the appellant’s testimony in this way tacitly shifted the
    burden of proof onto the appellant to demonstrate that the complainant had a
    motive to fabricate: see <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 321, at para.
    121 (C.A.). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has provided ample direction on the permissible use of a motive
    to fabricate in assessing credibility at the trial level. A misplaced emphasis on
    motive overlooks the fact that motive is, at best, a secondary consideration,
    and offers limited assistance to either party when sexual offences are at
    issue. At trial, the chief task is – and must remain – whether the Crown has
    met its burden beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
