    2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at paras. 23-26, the public interest element
    must be tested under the framework set by this court in <em>R. v. Farinacci</em> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32,</span><span lang=EN-CA> [1993] O.J. No. 2627,</span><span
lang=EN-CA> <i>per</i> Arbour J.A. (as she then was). </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='color:black'>I am obliged to weigh the factors of reviewability and
    enforceability. As Arbour J.A. said in <i>Farinacci</i>, at paras. 41-43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The concerns reflecting public interest, as
    expressed in the case-law, relate both to the protection and safety of the
    public and to the need to maintain a balance between the competing dictates of
    enforceability and reviewability. It is the need to maintain that balance which
    is expressed by reference to the public image of the criminal law, or the
    public confidence in the administration of justice. The “public interest”
    criterion in s. 679(3)(c) of the <em>Code </em>requires a judicial assessment
    of the need to review the conviction leading to imprisonment, in which case
    execution of the sentence may have to be temporarily suspended, and the need to
    respect the general rule of immediate enforceability of judgments.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Public confidence in the administration of
    justice requires that judgments be enforced. The public interest may require
    that a person convicted of a very serious offence, particularly a repeat
    offender who is advancing grounds of appeal that are arguable but weak, be
    denied bail. In such a case, the grounds favouring enforceability need not
    yield to the grounds favouring reviewability.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On the other hand,
    public confidence in the administration of justice requires that judgments be
    reviewed and that errors, if any, be corrected. This is particularly so in the
    criminal field where liberty is at stake. Public confidence would be shaken, in
    my view, if a youthful first offender, sentenced to a few months’ imprisonment
    for a property offence, was compelled to serve his or her entire sentence
    before having an opportunity to challenge the conviction on appeal. Assuming
    that the requirements of s. 679(3)(a) and (b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> are
    met, entitlement to bail is strongest when denial of bail would render the
    appeal nugatory, for all practical purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <i>Oland</i>, Moldaver J. reflected on <i>Farinacci</i> and added analytical details. He noted, at para. 31, that an appeal judge
    considering an application for bail pending appeal should consider the factors
    stipulated for bail pending trial by s.&nbsp;515(10)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    with necessary modifications to account for the fact that the presumption of
    innocence has been displaced by the conviction. The onus of establishing that
    the applicant should not be detained in custody is reversed and placed on the applicant:
    at para. 35. The factors to be considered are: the apparent strength of the
    prosecution’s case; the gravity of the offence; the circumstances surrounding
    the commission of the offence; and the fact that the accused is liable, on
    conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moldaver J. also considered the enforceability
    and reviewability interests and explained how, with appropriate modifications,
    the public confidence factors listed in s. 515(10)(c) are to be taken into
    account by the appeal judge in identifying the factors that make up the public
    confidence component in s. 679(3)(c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, he noted, at para. 37: “In considering
    the public confidence component under s. 679(3)(c), I see no reason why the
    seriousness of the crime for which a person has been convicted should not play
    an equal role in assessing the enforceability interest.” He added, at para. 38,
    that the appeal judge should have regard to the sentencing judge’s reasons, and
    not repeat that evaluation afresh. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Moldaver J. considered the
    “reviewability interest,” which he identified, at para. 40, as “the strength of
    the prosecution's case (s. 515(10)(c)(i)).” This “translates into the strength
    of the grounds of appeal … [and] in assessing the reviewability interest, the
    strength of an appeal plays a central role.” Specifically, Moldaver J. endorsed
    the view expressed by my colleague Trotter J.A. in his article entitled, “Bail
    Pending Appeal: The Strength of the Appeal and the Public Interest Criterion”
    (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 267 at 270, where he explained:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[R]ealistically,
    most cases do not raise strong claims regarding the public interest, at least
    not beyond the general concern that all criminal judgments ought to be
    enforced.... However, when an offence is serious, as with murder cases, such
    that public concern about enforceability is ignited, there should be a more
    probing inquiry into the chances of success on appeal. It is in this context
    that the balancing required by <i>Farinacci</i> requires some assessment of the
    merits, separate from the question of whether the appeal is frivolous or not. [Footnotes
    omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moldaver J. added, at para. 44 of <i>Oland</i>,
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In conducting a
    more pointed assessment of the strength of an appeal, appellate judges will
    examine the grounds identified in the notice of appeal with an eye to their
    general legal plausibility and their foundation in the record. For purposes of
    this assessment, they will look to see if the grounds of appeal clearly surpass

    The primary ground of appeal, elaborated upon by defence counsel at the oral

    jury on the use of cross-count similar fact evidence. Although the trial judge
    did provide some guidance when answering a question from the jury concerning
    two of the counts, the applicant’s counsel submits that the direction was
    wholly insufficient, as it was limited to only a pair of charges and still
    allowed the jury to engage in propensity reasoning since there were multiple
    counts and multiple complainants. The other grounds of appeal relate to other
    purported problems with the jury charge and the decision to permit video

    punishment and control” and that “the emotional and psychological impacts on
    all of the victims of the assaults has been devastating”: at para. 32. The
    graphic description of the applicant’s degrading and violent assaults on his
    spouse are set out in paras 21, 59 and 60 of the sentencing reasons, which
    bears repeating: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The assaults, beatings, choking and sexual
    assaults of [his spouse] and the assaults and assaults with a weapon against
    the children increased when [the applicant] had [his spouse] and their children
    move in with him … and continued to escalate when they moved into the basement
    of his mother’s home. The beatings were brutal and left physical marks and
    emotional scars, the latter of which have not healed. Indeed, as regards the
    last sexual assault against [his spouse], which was the most egregious, [the
    applicant] brutalized [his spouse] for over an hour, anally raping her, choking
    her to unconsciousness several times, kicking, closed fist punches and
    pummeling her, leaving her with what she believed were cracked ribs, bruising
    and an inability to get out of bed for several days. The beatings were
    overheard by the three children, and [one child] witnessed her mother’s
    injuries in the middle of these assaults and testified as regards what she
    witnessed. It was this last beating that propelled [his spouse] to overcome her
    significant fear of leaving and taking her children, and which propelled her to
    flee the home at night when [the applicant] went out for a haircut. Her fear
    had been born of the fact that [the applicant] had told her more than once that
    if she ever left and took the children with her, he would kill her. She
    believed that he was capable of and would do that.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The final counts of assault causing bodily
    harm and sexual assault were in the context of a particularly brutal beating,
    which lasted over an hour. The beating consisted of punching, kicking, choking
    to unconsciousness (for which no charge was laid) and anal sex, used as
    punishment. [The applicant’s spouse] was bedridden for days thereafter and
    testified that it was difficult to move. She felt as though ribs had been
    cracked and she had difficulty getting up without assistance to go to the
    bathroom. She testified that she had never been previously experienced such a

    looking at the totality of the full date range of that charge.” The trial judge

    subsequently came to the trial judge’s attention that the jury resolved their
    own question and decided to go on. The trial judge decided to bring the jury
    back and deliver a charge relating to cross-count evidence and propensity
    reasoning. Crown counsel and defence counsel agreed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge directed the jury with respect
    to the two particular counts, a count of assault and a count of choking, which
    arose out of the same transaction. The trial judge stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>And I will tell
    you that as regard count six and seven, the evidence to be considered is only
    the evidence related to the event, or the incident in question which was that
    incident about the interrogation and [the applicant] coming across the room and
    choking and hitting [his spouse]…. So, and we just wanted to, I would like to
    emphasize no other evidence outside the evidence related to that incident is to
    be considered, and no evidence say for instance which may suggest that [the applicant]
    may have been more likely to commit the offence related to the incident I’ve
    just described again, is to be considered. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge made no effort to generalize
    this to any other charges. The applicant was ultimately sentenced to a
    concurrent sentence of one year eight months for these two counts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the applicant relies heavily on this
    court’s decision in <i>R. v. M.(B.)</i>, 42 O.R. (3d) 1, [1998] O.J. No. 4359
    (C.A.), in which the accused was charged with a multiple count indictment of
    sexual offences relating to nine people, including his four daughters, an
    ex-wife, two other relations, a babysitter, a family friend, and two dogs. This
    court allowed the appeal, holding that the trial judge erred by failing to
    clearly explain that the jury could not use evidence of all the counts to prove
    any single count and by failing to provide a limiting instruction to guard
    against improper propensity reasoning regardless of the admissibility of
    similar fact evidence: at paras. 41-43. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I acknowledge that there are cases taking a
    similar view of the gravity of a faulty jury instruction on this issue: <i>R.
    v. B.(F.F.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697; <i>R. v. N.(R.K.)</i>, 32 O.R. (3d) 537;
    and <i>R. v. Tsigirlash</i>, 2019 ONCA 650, 157 W.C.B. (2d) 46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I am of the view that there are
    material distinctions between the circumstances in <i>M.(B.)</i> and the
    circumstances of the applicant. It is not the law that every failure to
    instruct a jury against propensity reasoning automatically results in a
    reversal of the conviction.  In <i>R. v. N.P.C.</i>, 2007 ONCA 457, 86 O.R.
    (3d) 571, at para. 23, leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 144, Gillese
    J.A. observed: “</span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unlikely that the jury would
    infer that because the appellant physically abused his wife, he also sexually
    assaulted his stepdaughters</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:100%'>– a completely different type of wrongdoing.” </span><span
lang=EN-CA> In <i> R. v. Sandhu</i>, 2009 ONCA 102, 242 C.C.C. (3d) 262, at
    para. 14, Laskin J.A. distinguished <i>M.(B.)</i>, noting that it involved
    multiple offences against multiple victims and evidence of discreditable
    conduct outside the scope of the indictment. <i>M.(B.)</i> might similarly have
    limited application to a case where the most serious charges relate to one
    victim and there is no material evidence outside the scope of the indictment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The possibility of propensity reasoning by the
    jury was present in this multiple count, multiple complainant case. </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>But it is not clear that a jury would infer
    that a father who disciplined his children excessively would be more likely to
    rape his spouse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I turn to the factors to be considered. I see
    the Crown’s side in this appeal as strong, and the applicant’s appeal weak. The
    gravity of the most vile and violent crimes cannot be overstated, in the
    circumstances surrounding their commission. The applicant has been sentenced to
    a lengthy term of imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted by Arbour J.A. in <i>Farinacci</i>, at
    para. 43, “entitlement to bail is strongest when denial of bail would render
    the appeal nugatory, for all practical purposes.”  Ultimately, although the
    reviewability interest still weighs in favour of release, the applicant’s
    conviction on two serious counts where the jury was charged about the
    impropriety of propensity reasoning and cross-count similar fact evidence mitigates
    the strength of the reviewability interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am mindful that it is relatively rare for a
    bail pending appeal application to be resolved based on public confidence
    considerations. That said, this is one of the “difficult cases … in which the
    public confidence component is raised”: <i>Oland</i>, at para. 30. The interest
    in enforceability is very strong. The interest in reviewability is not. As my
    colleague, Fairburn J.A., concluded in <i>R. v. Iraheta</i>, 2018 ONCA 229, 145
    W.C.B. (2d) 282, at para. 21: “Although the grounds of appeal are not
    frivolous, there is nothing that currently suggests that, pending his appeal,
    the appellant is at risk of continuing to serve a sentence that he will not
    have to serve one day.” In my view, this conclusion aptly applies to the
    circumstances of the applicant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The balance of the competing interests of
    enforceability and reviewability in this case come down in favour of
    enforceability. I have no hesitation in saying that a reasonable member of the
    public, informed of the egregious circumstances, would lose confidence in the
    administration of justice if the applicant were released pending appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I find that the detention of the applicant is
    necessary in the public interest and dismiss the application for bail pending
    appeal. Pursuant to s. 679(10) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,<i> </i>I order that the appeal be expedited.</span></p>
