    ONSC 3123, and the judgment of Justice Timothy Minnema of the Superior Court of

    C.R.R. (2d) 303.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Sharpe J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal considers the constitutionality of
    the statutory authority conferred upon inspectors and agents designated by the
    Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (the “OSPCA”) to
    exercise the powers of a peace officer in the enforcement of laws pertaining to
    the welfare and prevention of cruelty to animals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent is a paralegal who was given
    public interest standing to challenge certain provisions of the </span><em>Ontario
    Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act</em><i><span lang=EN-US>,</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> R.S.O. 1990, c. O.36 (the “Act”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge dismissed the respondent’s
    argument that provisions in the Act creating offences were matters of criminal
    law and therefore beyond the legislative authority of the province. The
    application judge also dismissed the respondent’s contention that certain
    provisions in the Act infringed s. 8 of </span><em>Charter of Rights and
    Freedoms</em><i> </i><span lang=EN-US>guaranteeing the right to be secure
    against unreasonable search and seizure. However, the application judge
    accepted the submission that some of the Act’s search and seizure provisions
    violated the s. 7 right not to be denied liberty and security of the person
    except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. He found that
    those search and seizure powers engaged the liberty and security of the person
    interests and he recognized a novel principle of fundamental justice, namely,
    that “law enforcement bodies must be subject to reasonable standards of
    transparency and accountability”. The application judge struck down the
    sections of the Act conferring the powers of a peace officer on OSPCA officers
    and agents as well as two sections authorizing search and seizure. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, the Attorney General of Ontario, appeals
    the order granting the respondent public interest standing and the s. 7 order
    striking down three sections of the Act. The respondent cross-appeals the dismissal
    of the s. 8 argument and seeks to add that “law enforcement bodies must be
    funded in such manner to avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest or
    apprehension of bias” as an additional principle of fundamental justice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the following reasons, I would allow the
    appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal. In my view, the application judge erred in
    finding that the liberty and security of the person interests protected by s. 7
    were engaged. It is also my view that he further erred in accepting that “law
    enforcement bodies must be subject to reasonable standards of transparency and
    accountability” as a novel principle of fundamental justice. However, he did
    not err in dismissing the s. 8 claim.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW OF THE ACT </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The relevant statutory provisions are set out in
    the Appendix to these reasons and may be summarized as follows.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The object of the Act “is to facilitate and
    provide for the prevention of cruelty to animals and their protection and
    relief therefrom” (s. 3). The Act constitutes the OSPCA and provides for its
    governance by a board of directors. While the OSPCA essentially functions as a
    private organization, the Lieutenant Governor in Council has the power to annul
    any by-law it enacts (s. 7(3)). The Act provides that the OSPCA shall appoint a
    Chief Inspector (s. 6.1(1)) who has the authority to establish qualifications,
    requirements and standards for inspectors and agents and to appoint, supervise
    and remove them (s. 6.1(2)).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The provision central to this challenge is s.
    11(1) which confers the powers of a police officer on OSPCA inspectors and
    agents for the purpose of enforcing the Act and any other law pertaining to
    animal safety and the prevention of cruelty to animals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The Act establishes obligations and prohibitions
    regarding the care of and harm to animals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The respondent challenged two provisions, ss.
    11.2(1) and 11.2(2), making it an offence to cause or permit an animal to be
    “in distress”, defined as “the state of being in need of proper care, water,
    food or shelter or being injured, sick or in pain or suffering or being abused
    or subject to undue or unnecessary hardship, privation or neglect” (s. 1). The
    application judge rejected the contention that those provisions were </span><em>ultra
    vires</em><span lang=EN> the province on the ground that they were, in pith and
    substance, criminal law. No appeal is taken from that aspect of the application
    judge’s order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The Act contains several provisions authorizing
    search and seizure. The respondent’s challenge to the following provisions was
    dismissed by the application judge:</span></p>

    intended, namely protection of vulnerable animals. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>.</span></i><span lang=EN-US> The application judge properly
    analyzed this issue in two stages: first, do the impugned provisions engage
    life, liberty or security of the person; and if the answer is yes, second, is
    the denial of life, liberty or security of the person in accordance with the
    principles of fundamental justice.</span></p>

    and security of the person. He rejected the appellant’s contention that as a
    deprivation of liberty would only arise after prosecution, conviction and
    sentencing, the search powers were too remote to trigger a s. 7 claim. The
    application judge also found that the impugned provisions engaged the security
    of the person interest and he rejected the appellant’s submission that the
    challenge to the impugned provisions should proceed under the more specific
    guarantee of s. 8.</span></p>

    of whether the interference with liberty and security of the person was in
    accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. He rejected the argument
    that the impugned provisions ran afoul of the principle of non-arbitrariness,
    the only accepted principle of fundamental justice raised by the respondent.
    However, he accepted as a novel principle of fundamental justice that “law
    enforcement bodies must be subject to reasonable standards of transparency and
    accountability”, while rejecting the inclusion of “integrity” as being too
    vague. He found, at para. 25, that while the respondent had “</span><span

    c. P.15, which provides a comprehensive system of oversight and accountability.
    He noted that while the OSPCA does have a policy manual relating to search and
    entry, it is not a public document and that complaints and discipline issues
    are dealt with by the OSPCA internally. Nor is the OSPCA subject to the </span><em>Ombudsman</em><i> <em>Act</em></i><i><span lang=EN-US>,</span></i><span lang=EN-US> R.S.O. 1990,

    the intervener’s submission that “although charged with law enforcement
    responsibilities, the OSPCA is opaque, insular, unaccountable, and potentially
    subject to external influence, and as such Ontarians cannot be confident that
    the laws it enforces will be fairly and impartially administered.”</span></p>

    the Supreme Court noted, at para. 74, that there was a substantial record of

    on this application and appeal, the constitutional arguments were advanced in
    the abstract without a proper factual foundation. In my view, it would have
    been preferable had this challenge come before the court either on the

    inspector or agent must have reasonable grounds to believe that an animal is in
    distress, that is, “being in need of proper care, water, food or shelter or
    being injured, sick or in pain or suffering or being abused or subject to undue
    or unnecessary hardship, privation or neglect” (s. 1(1)). A s. 13(1) order must
    be in writing. Upon being notified of the order, the owner of custodian is
    given the opportunity to challenge the order before the Animal Care Review
    Board. This means that entry into a dwelling can only take place after an inspector
    or agent has reasonable grounds to believe an animal is in distress, a written
    order has been given to the owner or custodian, and the owner or custodian has
    not complied with or challenged the order. While this falls short of the
    protection afforded by prior authorization obtained through a judicially

    of fundamental justice. In my view, the proposed principle fares no better when
    framed in terms of the reasonableness of the impugned powers of search and
    seizure. The proposed principle deals with general issues of governance and
    institutional design, not with the reasonableness, scope or exercise of powers
    of search and seizure. The alleged shortcomings in the legislation are too
    remote from the definition of the challenged statutory powers and the manner in
    which those powers are carried out. To succeed on this ground, the respondent
    would have to show that the lack of measures to ensure transparency,
    accountability and adequate funding realistically had or risked having an
    actual impact on the exercise of the challenged statutory powers. There is no
    such evidence in this case. The respondent’s complaint is with the general
    governance of the OSPCA, not with the definition of its statutory powers or the
    manner in which they are exercised. </span></p>

    s. 12(6) allows for entry without a warrant upon reasonable grounds to believe
    that an animal is in immediate distress. Section 12.1 allows inspectors, agents

    or custodian’s privacy interest than the other provisions with which I have
    already dealt. For the reasons I gave with respect to the other provisions

    2015 SCC 7, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 91. Transparency and accountability
    have a more limited legal pedigree. They are background values that the law
    sometimes takes into account in various ways and in various contexts. Courts
    may consider these values when interpreting the Constitution, statutes and
    common-law rules but they have not crystalized into the kind of operational or
    normative legal principle that can be independently deployed by a court to

    impose imprisonment for conduct that results in harm to others. The majority
    rejected that proposition, explaining that while harm may justify
    criminalization, the absence of proven harm does not preclude legislative
    action. At para. 114, the majority explained: “the ‘harm principle’ is better
    characterized as a description of an important state interest rather than a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I turn to the second question, namely whether
    transparency, accountability and adequate funding are “vital or fundamental to
    our societal notion of justice.” In </span><em>Canadian Foundation for Children</em><i><span
lang=EN>,</span></i><span lang=EN> the Supreme Court of Canada held that while
    “the best interests of the child” is a legal principle that succeeds at the
    first stage, it fails to meet the second criterion as a principle that is vital
    to our societal notion of justice. The majority stated, at para. 10, that while
    the “‘best interests of the child’ is widely supported in legislation and
    social policy and is an important factor for consideration in many contexts”, it
    is not “a foundational requirement for the dispensation of justice” because it
    is only one factor to be considered and it “may be subordinated to other
    concerns in appropriate contexts.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In my view, “best interests of the child” is much
    closer to being “vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice” than
    transparency, accountability and proper funding. The latter values are
    regularly subordinated to other concerns. For example, the right to access
    information under legislation such as the </span><em>Freedom of Information and
    Protection of Privacy Act</em><span lang=EN> is heavily qualified by exemptions
    for matters such as Cabinet confidentiality, certain types of advice to
    government, the interests of law enforcement, and solicitor-client privilege.
    The open court principle is subject to many exceptions required to protect
    competing rights and interests. As explained by the British Columbia Supreme
    Court in </span><em>Wakeling</em><span lang=EN>, at para. 49, with respect to
    transparency and accountability, “[t]here are areas relating to the
    administration of justice in which the application of these principles is
    either unworkable or rendered of secondary import because of other, more
    compelling interests.” The adequacy of funding for law enforcement bodies is
    plainly a matter for political debate and subject to being reconciled with
    other competing demands on the public purse. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Finally, I do not think that the proposed principle
    satisfies the third branch of the test that it “be capable of being identified

    results.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>It is far from clear to me what measures would be
    required to satisfy this alleged principle of fundamental justice. Achieving
    transparency, accountability and adequate funding for any public body opens a
    complex and multifaceted inquiry that could yield a wide range of outcomes. In
    the words of </span><em>Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</em><i><span lang=EN>,</span></i><span
lang=EN> at p. 503, transparency, accountability and adequate funding “lie in
    the realm of general public policy” and they do not fall within the category of
    “the basic tenets of our legal system”. Section 7 creates and protects
    individual legal rights and should not to be mistaken as a general guarantee of
    good governance. The design of a proper regime of law enforcement, one that
    ensures that peace officers are accountable, that their actions are subject to
    public scrutiny and that the law is enforced with integrity, are questions of
    public policy, not individual legal rights. The shape and contours of a
    properly designed system cannot be “identified with some precision” and we have
    been offered no standards that could be “applied to situations in a manner that
    yields predictable results.” </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>It functions as a factor considered along with

    reasonable people may well disagree about the result that its application will
    yield, particularly in areas of the law where it is one consideration among
    many, such as the criminal justice system.&nbsp;It does not function as a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[82]<span

    falls short, transparency, accountability and adequate funding must fall well
    short. There is an extensive body of case law on “best interests of the child”.
    It is applied every day in the courts of this province. Lawyers and judges
    understand what it means and know how to apply it. Transparency, accountability
    and adequate funding are, on the other hand, background values that some laws
    promote with varying degrees of stringency. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As Prof. Stewart explains in </span><em>Fundamental
    Justice</em><i><span lang=EN>,</span></i><span lang=EN> at p. 124, recognizing
    a principle of fundamental justice creates a standard against which non-compliant
    legislation will be struck down. It is therefore “essential that the principle
    be sufficiently precise” so that “the public, the legislature, and other courts
    and tribunals understand exactly what is the defect in the legislation that
    leads to its invalidation and how that defect might be cured.” The respondent
    and the interveners have failed to identify with any degree of precision the
    content of this alleged principle. There is very little legal guidance on what
    it means or requires.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I recognize, of course, that to satisfy the
    third branch of the principles of fundamental justice test, a proposed
    principle does not have to define</span><span lang=EN> a precise, bright-line
    rule</span><span lang=EN-US> and</span><span lang=EN> that the exercise of
    judgment may be required to determine its meaning in any given case. Obvious
    examples are the principles that laws must not be arbitrary, overly broad or
    grossly disproportionate: see </span><em>Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford</em><i>,</i> 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101<span lang=EN>. However, a proposed principle
    does have to set out what the Supreme Court described in a similar context as
    an intelligible standard, capable of providing “an adequate basis for legal
    debate … as to its meaning by reasoned analysis applying legal criteria”: </span><em>R.
    v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society</em><i><span lang=EN>, </span></i><span
lang=EN>[1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, at p. 693. This requirement is satisfied in the
    case of arbitrariness, overbreadth and gross disproportionality. Those
    principles require the court to “compare the rights infringement caused by the
    law with the objective of the law, not with the law’s effectiveness”: </span><em>Bedford</em><span
lang=EN>, at para. 123. The inquiry is disciplined, defined and confined by the
    right at issue and the contours and effect of the law that is being challenged.
    It requires the court to apply some general external value of good governance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>To accept transparency, accountability and adequate
    funding as a principle of fundamental justice would, in my view, create uncertainty
    and necessarily involve the courts in the “adjudication of policy matters”. As
    the Railway Association of Canada points out, federal and provincial
    legislation confer law enforcement powers on a wide array of individuals,
    including railway constables, who are not members of any formal police force.
    The </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN> gives such powers to “every
    person” in many situations, including: assisting a police officer (s. 25(4)),
    preventing an offence causing harm to others (s. 27), and preventing a breach
    of the peace (s. 30). The principle of fundamental justice accepted by the
    application judge would, in my view, invite more questions than it would
    answer. It would inevitably involve the courts in complex policy issues
    regarding law enforcement and institutional design, issues for which legal
    analysis under the </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN> is ill-suited. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I think it important to add as a final note that
    the operation of the Act is not entirely devoid of transparency and
    accountability. If a prosecution is brought by the OSPCA, any searches or
    seizures are subject to judicial and </span><em>Charter</em><span lang=EN> scrutiny. Orders regarding animals in distress, including removal orders, may
    be appealed to the Animal Care Review Board. These features do subject the
    OSPCA to a certain level of accountability. Persons charged with offences are
    entitled to full disclosure of the fruits of an investigation under the
    principle established in </span><em>R. v. Stinchcombe</em><span lang=EN>,
    [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, thereby ensuring transparency.</span></p>

    establish standards for inspectors and agents, to oversee inspectors and agents
    in the performance of their duties, and where appropriate, to remove them: O

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>COSTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both parties filed written costs submissions
    seeking costs of this appeal. The appellant submits that if successful, it
    should be awarded costs fixed at $20,000. The respondent submits that as a
    public interest litigant, he should be awarded $20,000, plus HST, regardless of
    the outcome of the appeal. None of the interveners asks for costs and no costs
    are requested against the interveners. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the circumstances of this appeal do
    not warrant an order requiring the respondent to pay the appellant’s costs. The
    respondent was successful at first instance and following that decision the
    OSPCA withdrew from enforcing the Act. The appellant brought the appeal because
    of concern over the implications of the application judge’s decision and to
    clarify the law. As is apparent from these reasons, I agree with the
    appellant’s concerns and in my view the appeal was properly brought. That said,
    as the OSPCA had withdrawn from enforcement duties, the respondent has achieved
    practical if not legal success. I am not persuaded that the ordinary “loser
    pays” rule should be applied in these circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The case law recognizes a discretion to depart
    from the “loser pays” principle and decline a costs order in favour of a
    successful government litigant in constitutional litigation: see </span><em>Incredible
    Electronics v. Canada (Attorney General)</em><span lang=EN-US> (2006), 80 O.R.
    (3d) 723 (Sup. Ct.), at para. 74; </span><em>Thompson and Empowerment Council
    v. Ontario</em><i><span lang=EN-US>,</span></i><span lang=EN-US> 2013 ONSC
    6357, 118 O.R. (3d) 34. I would apply that discretion in this case and decline
    to order costs in favour of the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is also a discretion to award an
    unsuccessful public interest litigant costs in </span><em>Charter</em><span
lang=EN-US> litigation. However, “highly unusual” circumstances are required to
    justify such an order which should be made “only in very rare cases”: </span><em>B.
    (R.) v. Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto</em><i><span lang=EN-US>,</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> [1995] 1 S.C.R. 315, at p. 390. In my view, this case does not call
    for an exceptional order. The respondent is not a marginalized, disadvantaged
    person. There is no evidence that he is a person of limited means. He was given
    public interest standing and access to justice concerns are adequately met by
    departing from the “loser pays” principle and declining to order costs against
    him.</span></p>
