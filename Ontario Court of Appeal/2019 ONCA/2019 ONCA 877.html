  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This an appeal from conviction for sexual
    assault. The complainant was the appellant’s former girlfriend. There is no
    dispute that they remained close friends after their romantic relationship
    ended, continuing with some sort of relationship. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant and some other individuals were
    at the appellant’s home drinking on the night in question. After the appellant had
    retired to his bedroom, he sent the complainant a text message, asking her to
    come to his room because he could not sleep. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that upon receiving
    the appellant’s text message, she went to his room, laid down on her back and
    fell asleep on his bed. It was not unusual for her to sleep over at the
    appellant’s home and even in his room with him after the end of their romantic
    relationship. The complainant testified that she awoke to find that her pants
    had been removed and that the appellant was having vaginal intercourse with
    her. She testified that she yelled at the appellant, retrieved her clothing and
    left his room. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s version of events was
    fundamentally different. While he agreed that he had texted the complainant,
    asking that she come to his room, he testified that the sexual intercourse only
    commenced when the complainant said to him, “fuck me”. The appellant testified
    that the complainant gave a “weird gasp” during the course of consensual
    intercourse, got up, grabbed her clothes and left the room. He surmised that
    the complainant may have been upset because he had, perhaps, mistakenly
    inserted his penis into her anus. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is common ground that the appellant and
    complainant’s relationship never recovered. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that the trial judge
    erred in three respects:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='
line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-CA>(a)     reversing the burden of proof; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='
line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-CA>(b)     misapprehending the evidence; and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='
line-height:150%'><span lang=EN-CA>(c)     failing to provide reasons for why
    he rejected the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree that the trial judge erred in
    these respects. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s reasons carefully set out the
    burden and standard of proof. They specifically state that the verdict could
    not be based on a choice between the appellant’s and complainant’s evidence.
    The trial judge properly applied the principles in <em>R. v. W.(D.), </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[1991]</span></em> 1 S.C.R. 742. Finally, the reasons
    display a keen understanding of the fact that the central issue for
    determination was whether, based on the whole of the evidence, the Crown had
    proven the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave detailed reasons for
    rejecting the appellant’s evidence. He found that there were significant
    inconsistencies in the appellant’s version of the circumstances from the time
    that the complainant entered his room until the time that she purportedly asked
    to have intercourse. The trial judge set out those circumstances as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>One version was an “in the moment” awareness
    of a continuous chain of events that started with [the complainant] removing
    her pants and initiating sexual intercourse almost immediately afterward. The
    other involved an after-the-fact realization of the presence of another
    semi-nude person. Although the two versions became one, their commencement
    cannot be rationalized.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In oral submissions, the appellant suggested
    that this passage reflects a material misapprehension of the evidence going to
    the heart of why the appellant’s evidence was rejected and, therefore, the
    heart of the verdict. The appellant contends that the trial judge must have
    misunderstood his statement to the police, thinking that it only suggested that
    he awoke after the complainant was already in his bed, nude from the waist
    down. Yet the statement includes a qualifier not mentioned by the trial judge:
    “I don’t know if it was her that came by – like come into the room that
    possibly woke me up and made me reach over, want a drink of water, but I –
    maybe she moved around, I don’t know.” Accordingly, the appellant submits that
    the trial judge found inconsistencies where there were none. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We find no misapprehension of the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his statement to the police, the appellant
    repeatedly suggested that he only realized that the complainant was in his room
    when he reached over to get a bottle of water and discovered her already in his
    bed. His qualifier – that he may have awoken when she came into the room – came
    much later in his statement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the appellant’s affidavit filed on the s. 276 <em>Criminal Code, </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>R.S.C., 1985, c.
    C-46</span></em> application, he definitively suggested that his “sleep was
    disturbed” by the complainant’s entry into the room. In contrast, in his
    evidence in-chief at trial, he reverted to the suggestion that he “woke up to
    [the complainant] next to [him]”. Then in cross-examination he said that he
    “noticed her getting into [his] bed, and as that happened she disturbed [his] sleep”.
    He also said that he “heard the door, and then I was still laying there, and
    didn’t think anything of it, and then when she got undressed, and then finally
    came into bed, she disturbed my sleep. So I moved over, and at the same time,
    when I moved, I went to get a glass, or a drink of water from the bottle that
    was next to my bed.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are satisfied that the trial judge did not
    materially misapprehend the evidence. It was open to the trial judge to
    conclude that the appellant had described the events in that period of time in
    different ways. We would defer to that factual determination. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, contradictions in the appellant’s
    description of when he awoke were not the only reason that the trial judge gave
    for rejecting the appellant’s credibility. The trial judge also gave other
    reasons for rejecting his evidence, including that the appellant’s version of
    the events made no sense:  </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The evening had been a pleasant one from all
    accounts. The get-together had been planned albeit only earlier that day. No
    friction of any kind was identified in the shack during the initial or later
    portion of the evening or during the time at the Creamery. In short, absolutely
    nothing had happened before [the complainant] entered the bedroom that gave any
    indication that anything troubling would occur that night. [The appellant’s] “report
    of unintentional anal penetration during a complainant initiated sexual
    encounter, followed by a complete disintegration of a long-term
    post-relationship, does not resonate at all. That version of events is not
    truthful. It is not reliable. It is invented.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We also note that the trial judge also gave
    detailed reasons for believing the complainant’s evidence. To the extent that
    her evidence contained frailties, he addressed and resolved them. Close to the
    end of his reasons, the trial judge mentioned the legal proposition arising
    from <em>R. v. J.J.R.D.</em><i> </i>(2006)<i>, </i>215 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont.
    C.A.), at para. 53, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 69,
    that an accused’s evidence could be rejected upon a “considered and reasoned
    acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of the truth of conflicting credible
    evidence”. This was yet another reason for why the trial judge rejected the
    appellant’s evidence. We would defer to his credibility findings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant argues that trial judge
    erred by failing to address his alternative argument that, even if the
    complainant did not consent, he held an honest but mistaken belief in the fact
    that she did. The trial judge merely said that “[t]he case does not involve a
    complainant who forgot that she had consented to sexual intercourse. Nor does
    it involve an accused who honestly, but mistakenly, believed consent had been
    given.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says that this cursory comment,
    dismissing his alternative defence, was insufficient and lacks any reasoning. He
    makes two broad points. First, he maintains that the trial judge erred by not
    considering whether the complainant was in a parasomniac state (see <em>R. v.
    Luedecke</em>, 2008 ONCA 716, 93 O.R. (3d) 89, at para. 28), leaving her with
    the ability to consent to the sexual acts while asleep, but with no memory of
    that consent. In support of that proposition, the appellant relies upon this
    court’s decision in <em>R. v. Garciacruz</em><i>, </i>2015 ONCA 27, 320 C.C.C.
    (3d) 414. Second, he argues that it is possible to “splice some of each
    person’s evidence with respect to the encounter, and settle upon a reasonably
    coherent set of facts, supported by the evidence” that would be capable of
    supporting his alternative defence of mistaken belief in consent: <em>R. v.
    Park</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836, at para. 25.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We conclude that the trial judge was under no
    obligation to address the alternative defence beyond what he said. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, <em>Garciacruz</em><i> </i>is a
    fundamentally different case. It involves a complainant who admitted that she was
    in a blackout state on the night in question which began long before the
    alleged sexual assault took place and ended some time afterwards. During that
    time, the complainant performed many acts of which she had no memory, including
    her inability to recall leaving a bar, walking to a car, taking a ride, having
    a conversation with her cousin, and ordering a taxi for her cousin’s use. In
    those circumstances, involving the complainant functioning, but with no memory
    of what she did, this court said that it was incumbent on the trial judge to
    consider whether the complainant may have consented to the sexual activity, but
    simply have no recollection of having done so: <em>Garciacruz</em><i>, </i>at
    para. 55-57.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This case bears no resemblance to <em>Garciacruz</em>.
    This was not a case about a blackout, but about a complainant falling asleep
    and waking up to find sexual intercourse in progress. The complainant in this
    case had a clear recollection of the events prior to and after the sexual
    activity in question. She remembered receiving the appellant’s text message, entering
    his room, falling asleep and then awaking to find the intercourse occurring.
    She also remembered what she said when she awoke, getting dressed, being very
    upset and eventually going back out to the shack where the others were still
    gathered. The trial judge accepted that evidence as true. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the factual foundation for the
    parasomnia argument rests on the appellant’s version of events, that the
    complainant invited sexual intercourse. Yet that version of events was rejected
    by the trial judge, a finding that is owed deference by this court. In these
    circumstances, we agree with the respondent that it would have been entirely speculative
    to infer that the complainant initiated sexual intercourse while she was
    asleep.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, this is not a case where it was possible
    to splice together a coherent set of facts capable of supporting the suggestion
    of a mistaken belief in consent. The complainant and appellant gave diametrically
    opposed accounts, one involving consent and the other involving no consent. Importantly,
    on the salient points, the trial judge entirely rejected the appellant’s
    version of events and accepted the complainant’s version. Based on his findings
    of fact, there was no air of reality to the suggestion that the appellant had
    mistakenly believed that the complainant had consented. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, there was no need to address the
    alternative defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
