    Mr. Robertson’s disposition by the Ontario Review Board under appeal, he
    requested an absolute discharge on the basis that he was no longer a
    significant threat to public safety. He proposed, as an alternative, a transfer
    to another facility. In the further alternative, he requested the board to
    order an assessment for a period of up to six weeks in order to obtain a second
    opinion on his diagnosis. For the reasons that follow we dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

    committed the index offences of criminal harassment and an invitation to sexual
    touching in 2001 and 2002, which resulted in a finding in 2007 that he was not
    criminally responsible by reason of a mental disorder. He had earlier been
    convicted of rape in 1978, and for a sexual assault in 1983 that occurred shortly
    after his release. </span></p>

    been under a number of board dispositions made from June 2009 to the
    disposition under appeal. In each disposition, based on a finding that he posed
    a significant risk to the safety of the public, he was ordered to be detained
    at Waypoint. </span></p>

    hospital report and the addendum, Mr. Robertson’s current diagnoses are
    Paraphilia, Not Otherwise Specified; Cannabis Abuse; Polysubstance Dependence,
    Prior History; Antisocial Personality Disorder; and Narcissistic Personality
    Disorder. The board noted that Mr. Robertson has extremely high scores on the
    PCL-R test, which confirms that he is a psychopath.</span></p>

    this appeal is whether the board’s disposition falls within a range of
    reasonable outcomes. Mr. Robertson and <em>amicus</em> raise several other
    issues, which are stated in the headings below. </span></p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does Mr. Robertson continue to pose a significant risk to public safety?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Mr. Robertson and <em>amicus</em> argue that there is no factual basis to support a finding that
    he presents a risk to public safety any longer, after many years of
    incarceration. They point out that there is no evidence of physical violence other
    than two incidents in which Mr. Robertson was responding to the aggressiveness
    of other patients. His treating psychiatrist, Dr. A. Danyluk, acknowledged that
    there have been no complaints about Mr. Robertson’s behaviour from staff during
    the two years that she has been his psychiatrist, and no complaints about his
    behaviour from numerous interactions he has had with doctors, physiotherapists,
    the dentist and court staff while under her care. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The board referred
    to Dr. Danyluk’s testimony at para. 47:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote> Dr. Danyluk was asked whether the recent (seven months)
    behavioural improvement has changed her opinion on the issue of significant
    threat. Dr. Danyluk responded that it has not. In her opinion, Mr. Robertson
    remains a significant threat. She reaches that conclusion based on his lengthy
    criminal record for serious assaultive conduct, his substance abuse history,
    the results of the phallometric testing, his preference for coercive sexual
    activities, and his lack of programming such as anger management programs. She
    also noted his lack of insight and his refusal to accept responsibility for any
    of his past conduct. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Mr. Robertson
    also challenged Dr. Danyluk’s qualifications as an expert because she is not
    yet certified as a forensic psychiatrist. The board rejected the challenge and
    notes simply that she had been accepted as an expert witness in hundreds of
    hearings. We see no error in this determination.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Before this
    court, Mr. Robertson noted that he has been at Waypoint since 2008 and asserted
    that there has been no movement towards reintegrating him back into the
    community. Apart from his psychiatric treatment, he has not been provided with
    therapy. He has not shown signs of psychosis in a number of years and is not
    presently medicated. Dr. Danyluk testified that there were programs at Waypoint
    that could assist Mr. Robertson, including an anger management program, a
    substance abuse program, and a mindfulness program, but he had chosen not to
    engage. He has also avoided contact with the psychometrist, as a result of
    which his psychometric tests are dated.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'> The board’s
    decision relied on the unanimous opinion of Dr. Danyluk and the clinical team
    that “Mr. Robertson remains a significant threat to public safety”: para. 31. The
    board's decision was plainly reasonable and is amply supported by the evidence.
    Mr. Robertson continues to pose a significant threat to the safety of the
    public as defined by s. 672.5401 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. There is no evidentiary
    support for an absolute discharge. We do not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Amicus</span></i><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'> asserted that the board erred in
    failing to find that there was a treatment impasse at Waypoint, to which the
    board is obliged to respond, relying particularly on <em>Gonzalez (Re)</em>,
    2017 ONCA 102, 136 O.R. (3d) 453, leave to appeal refused, 2017 CarswellOnt 9960
    &amp; 9961; 2018 CarswellOnt 2600 &amp; 2601. This issue was not raised before
    the board and is not properly raised for the first time on appeal. </span></p>
  <h2><span style='line-height:100%'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>Should the board have ordered an
    independent assessment?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Mr. Robertson
    sought an independent assessment, to be performed by Dr. Federoff, even though
    he was the psychiatrist who “supported Mr. Robertson being found not criminally
    responsible.” The board also noted Mr. Robertson’s testimony that he would be
    open to another assessor but he wanted “the assessor to be &quot;open
    minded&quot; and be prepared to consider whether Mr. Robertson was properly
    convicted of the rape charge and of the sexual assault charge”: para. 71. He
    also wanted a second opinion on the appropriate diagnoses, whether or not he
    remains a significant threat to public safety, and whether the necessary and
    appropriate disposition is detention at Waypoint: para. 20. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>In the board’s
    reasons, Mr. Robertson’s request for an independent assessment was confusingly
    intertwined with his request for a transfer, but there was clarification in
    argument before this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>Waypoint did not
    oppose an assessment at another facility, but counsel argued before the board
    that the transfer for an assessment should only be to a facility where female
    co-patients would not be present and that certain conditions were required in
    the interest of safety: para. 68. Mr. Robertson indicated that he would not go
    for such an assessment unless he could take his computer with him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>The board refused
    to order the assessment on the basis that “there is simply no reason for Mr.
    Robertson to be assessed elsewhere.” The board referred to Dr. Danyluk’s
    opinion: “that any independent psychiatric assessment would simply confirm Mr.
    Robertson's diagnoses, would confirm that he remains a significant threat to
    public safety and would confirm that the necessary and appropriate Disposition
    remains a Detention Order at the Provincial Forensic Program.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>It became clear
    in argument that Mr. Robertson would be amenable to an independent assessment
    conducted at Waypoint. Counsel for Waypoint agreed that this was acceptable,
    but that Dr. Federoff, Mr. Robertson’s preferred assessor, would not be
    acceptable, since  she saw him as a “defence expert” and therefore not
    independent. Mr. Robertson’s assessment is dated and the evidence would be
    relevant to any board disposition. There is merit in this request.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;line-height:100%'>There is an issue
    about the scope of an independent assessment. The board took the view that Mr.
    Robertson is “hoping to find a doctor or psychiatric team that would be willing
