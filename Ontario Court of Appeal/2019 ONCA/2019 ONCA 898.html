    spa. The appellant played along, got undressed in the “spa”, and proposed that
    A.D. give him a massage. He lay down on A.D.’s bed on his stomach, undressed
    except for a towel draped over his middle section covering his buttocks. As A.D.
    massaged the appellant’s shoulders, the appellant told her she could go lower.
    When she was massaging the appellant’s hip area, he told her not to be afraid
    to touch anything and she could massage anywhere she wanted. A.D. took this to
    mean, in her words, “his butt”. A.D. refused.</p>

  <p class=CQuote>[Mr. C] is charged with eight offences. There are two
    complainants. Each charge requires its own proof. The real issue for you to
    decide in this case is whether the offences alleged by each complainant ever
    actually took place.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Be careful not to jump to the conclusion that if one
    complainant is telling the truth the others must be telling the truth as well,
    nor should you jump to the conclusion that because the complainants alleged
    similar conduct they all must have occurred if any one of them is proved. It is
    up to Crown counsel to prove each charge independently of the others.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>You may, but you do not have to find that there is a pattern of
    similar conduct that confirms each complainant’s testimony that the offences
    took place. It is for you to say.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In considering this evidence, bear in mind the relationship
    between [Mr. C], the complainants, as well as the circumstances of both of the
    situations.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In deciding whether there is such a pattern of similar conduct,
    you should consider this example. Recall that there was an allegation that [Mr.
    C] invited the girls to pinch his buttocks to get their lunch or a snack when they
    were hungry. Also, [A.D.] said that [Mr. C] invited her to massage his buttocks
    in the spa incident. Both of these events, if true, involved an invitation by [Mr.
    C] to touch his buttocks.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If you conclude that there is a pattern of similar conduct between
    or among any offences with which [Mr. C] is charged, you may use that evidence
    of similar conduct on each charge together with the rest of the evidence
    relating to that charge in reaching your verdict on any other charge.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If you conclude that [Mr. C] did the acts alleged on any
    offence charged, you must not use the evidence of that conduct to conclude or
    to help you conclude that [Mr. C] is a person of general bad character or
    disposition who likely committed the acts charged in any other count because of
    that bad character or disposition.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Further, if you conclude that [Mr. C] did the acts alleged in
    any offence charged, you must not punish [Mr. C] by finding him guilty of any
    other offence simply because he did those other acts.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If you do not, or are unable to conclude that the acts charged
    in some counts are so similar to those charged in others that they show a
    pattern of similar conduct, you must not use the evidence on those charges in
    reaching your verdict on any other charge.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Whether or not you use the evidence of any complainant to help
    you decide whether any other complainant is telling the truth, you must not
    find [Mr. C] guilty of any offence unless Crown counsel has satisfied you
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence charged actually took place and that
    [Mr. C] committed it.</p>

    relevant, and the inference it was said to support. He argues that discussions

    Crown,</span><em> amicus</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><span
lang=EN-US> and the trial judge that certain counts did not involve acts that
    were similar to those involved in other counts. He says those agreements should
    have resulted in an instruction that evidence on those counts could not be used
    on other counts, together with a warning against engaging in propensity
    reasoning arising from that evidence:</span><em> R</em><span lang=EN-US>. </span><em>v.</em> <em>Dawson</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2016 ONCA 880, 343 C.C.C. (3d) 499, at paras
    22-27. But those agreements were not reflected in the charge itself, which only
    provided an example of counts that might be similar and left it to the jury to
    decide whether to consider all counts as similar, leaving them free to apply
    all the evidence on all the counts.</span></p>

    a witness on counts that pertained to the other, and their credibility was a
    central issue in the case. It was necessary for the jury to consider the
    totality of the evidence on each count to decide this issue, even if similar
    facts were not involved. Moreover, the Crown argues that it made a sufficient
    request for evidence on each count to be admitted as similar fact evidence on each
    other count, to which there was no objection. The evidence was properly
    admissible as similar fact evidence on each count. There was only one agreement
    reached at the pre-charge conference, and that was that the wording of the
    final charge to the jury was appropriate.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>[25] </span>… three related points must be
    brought home to the jury to counter the prejudice inherent in a multi-count

    is that only the evidence admissible with respect to the particular count can
    be considered when determining guilt or innocence on that count (the
    instruction to keep the evidence relating to each count separate). The second
    is that a finding of guilt on one count is not evidence of guilt on another.
    And the third is that evidence of discreditable conduct or criminal acts cannot
    be used to reason that the accused is the type of person who would have
    committed any of the offences (the propensity reasoning instruction).</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[26] The fact that the second two are actually examples of the
    first critical instruction – that the jury must keep the evidence on each count

    credibility to be assessed on the totality of his evidence on all the counts – made

    similar fact evidence”: <em>P.E.C.</em>, at p. 291. Here, the appellant’s
    complaint is that the trial judge instructed the jury that, if they found
    counts to be similar, they could consider evidence on one count in support of
    the proof of guilt of the appellant on other counts. This goes beyond its use

    of similar fact evidence involves considering whether the probative value of
    the evidence on a particular issue outweighs its prejudicial effect, thus
    justifying its reception: <em>Handy</em>, at para. 55. If the test is met, the
    evidence may be admitted to support a factual contention or inference advanced

    case”: </span><em>Handy</em><span lang=EN-US>, at para. 92. This may be true of

    way are so clearly linked to the offence charged that the possibility of mere

    in credibility. The issue broadly framed is credibility, but more accurately

    In my view, the use of evidence across counts in this case was designed to
    engage a similar type of reasoning. It was to show that the appellant had a
    specific propensity to molest his grandnieces – who were similar in age – in a
    defined context – when he was alone with them during family visits. Indeed,
    that was exactly what the Crown, in oral argument in this court, stated was relevant
    about the across count evidence. In order for the evidence to be used this way,
    the test for similar fact evidence admission needed to be met and the jury
    properly instructed on its use. I turn now to that issue.</span></p>

    application before trial if it is seeking to admit evidence of similar acts
    (whether included in other counts or not) (r. 30.02(1)). The Crown is required
    to file a notice of application, setting out, among other things, “a detailed
    description of the presumptively inadmissible evidence the [Crown] seeks to
    introduce” and “a precise, case-specific statement of the basis and grounds
    upon which the evidence is said to be admissible” (rr. 30.03(1)-(2)). </p>

    which should be treated lightly. A Crown request to admit such evidence is a
    requirement which flows from its presumptive inadmissibility and the need for
    an appropriate process to determine whether that presumption should be
    displaced in a specific case: <em>Tsigirlash</em>, at paras. 26-27. Here, a
    request but not a formal application was made at the pre-trial conference. On appellate
    review, the absence of a formal application may not be fatal if the request
    gave the defence a meaningful opportunity to respond and lay the groundwork for
    a proper admissibility inquiry: <em>Tsigirlash</em>, at para. 27, <em>R. v.</em> <em>T.B.L</em>. (2003), 173 O.A.C. 159 (C.A.), at pp. 161-162; <em>R. v. Graham</em>,

    meaningful opportunity to respond at the pre-trial conference. Further, the
    defence also had a meaningful opportunity to respond in the six months between
    the pre-trial conference and trial. It was left open at the pre-trial conference
    for </span><em>amicus</em> <span lang=EN-US>to advise the Crown and the court
    if there was an objection to evidence being admitted across counts as similar
    fact evidence. </span><em>Amicus</em><span lang=EN-US>, who had been appointed

    pre-trial conference did not expressly identify the purpose for which the
    similar fact evidence would be used. The purpose for which the evidence is to
    be used is critical to determine if there is a basis for admissibility: </span><em>Handy</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 73, 82 and 99. However, I would not view that deficiency
    as determinative in this specific situation, for two reasons. First, the
    specificity of the Crown’s request was a function of the position the defence
    was taking. That position was a lack of objection to the evidence being used
    across counts. At no time did the defence or</span><em> amicus</em><span
lang=EN-US> indicate that more specificity was needed before a response was
    articulated. Second, this was at its core a case with one overarching issue:
    did the offences occur as the complainants described them? The appellant’s
    defence was a denial either of what occurred or that what occurred had the
    character alleged. The purpose of the evidence—the issue the evidence would go
    to--namely whether there was a pattern of behaviour showing the appellant engaged
    in acts of a certain character in specific circumstances--was obvious. Indeed,
    the trial judge in his charge described that purpose: “a pattern of similar
    conduct that confirms each complainant’s testimony that the offences took
    place”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An admissibility inquiry is required when
    similar fact evidence is in issue. The trial judge has a gatekeeper function,
    namely, to decide the threshold admissibility question of whether the evidence
    on one count may be considered by the jury on any of the others. As outlined
    above, the trial judge decides this question based in part on whether the
    allegations reveal a pattern of similar conduct. However, once the trial judge
    determines the evidence is admissible across counts, it is “entirely within the
    province of the jury” to decide whether they consider the conduct </span><em>sufficiently</em><span
lang=EN-US> similar to make any inference based on a pattern of similar
    conduct: </span><em>R. v. Simpson </em><span lang=EN-US>(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d)

    J.A., quoted with approval in </span><em>R. v. Arp</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 65. Once the evidence is before the jury, the trial
    judge’s duty is to guide the jury through that process with an adequate
    instruction about the permitted and prohibited uses of this evidence: </span><em>R.
    v. J.A.T., </em>2012 ONCA 177, 288 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 50<span lang=EN-US>. </span></p>

    admissibility of the evidence across counts in the context of how he would
    charge the jury. This was appropriate. In a multi-count indictment case, the
    similar fact evidence issue is not whether the evidence will be heard at all,
    but whether evidence the jury has heard, because it was properly admissible on
    one count, can properly be taken into account on another. The trial judge
    invited submissions, in the pre-charge conference, on what the jury should be
    told they could and could not do with such evidence. Failing to conduct a
    separate admissibility hearing in these circumstances does not justify
    appellate interference, especially given the absence of any defence objection: <em>Graham</em>,
    at para. 32.</span></p>

    admissible as similar fact evidence. It was not evidence of a general
    disposition. The evidence can fairly be described as showing a pattern of
    behaviour in a “closely defined and circumscribed context” demonstrating a
    specific propensity of the appellant to act in a certain way in certain
    circumstances, namely when he was alone with his grandnieces and could take
    advantage of the opportunity provided by family visits. The differences among
    the offences did not materially detract from their relevant similarity. In
    cases of sexual offences, the dissimilarities between the sexual acts or the
    body parts involved are often not as compelling as the similarity in the
    circumstances surrounding the incidents: <em>R. v. B.(L.)</em> (1997), 35 O.R.
    (3d) 35 (C.A.), at pp. 52-54.</span></p>

    similarities and dissimilarities as contemplated in </span><em>Handy</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at paras. 121-131, this is understandable given the way the matter
    was discussed before him. No submission was made that the evidence lacked
    probative value. There was no argument that prejudice outweighed probative
    value. The focus of some of the discussion appears to have been about the
    similarity of the acts or body parts, but I do not take those as indicative of
    an agreement of lack of essential similarity of circumstances. I agree with the
    Crown that all we can take as having been agreed at the pre-charge conference
    was the content of the final jury charge itself. It was clear from the
    discussion, and the final jury charge, that to the extent there might be
    prejudice to the appellant, that was properly dealt with by the limiting
    instructions in the charge itself.</span></p>

    would have been clear to the jury that to the extent they did not find the acts
    similar, they could only convict the appellant of a count based on the evidence
    related to that count. As well, the charge made it clear that in no event could
    the jury use prohibited propensity reasoning; they were expressly told that
    even if they found the appellant guilty of any of the counts they could not use
    that to conclude he </span>is “a person of general bad character or disposition

    acts were similar, it instead provided an example of what might be considered
    similar. That example involved similarities of sexual acts and body parts

    similarity higher, rather than lower, that it otherwise might have been. There

    when, at the pre-trial conference, similar fact evidence was discussed. The
