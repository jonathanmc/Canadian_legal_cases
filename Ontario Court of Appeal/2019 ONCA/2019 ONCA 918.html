  <p><strong>BROWN J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading align=center style='text-align:center'>PART I: OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a trial before a judge and jury, the appellant was convicted
    of sexual assault, sexual interference, and uttering threats to cause death.
    His conviction for sexual assault was stayed pursuant to the principle in <em>R.
    v. Kienapple</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. The appellant was sentenced to three
    years’ incarceration. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant appeals his conviction and

    with reasons to follow. These are those reasons.</span></p>

    APPEAL</p>
  <p class=Heading>THE APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the sexual offences, the appellant was 26 years old and
    the complainant was 14 years of age. The complainant alleged that the appellant
    had sexual intercourse with her at her home while her parents were away and, on
    another occasion, kissed her in her bedroom for about five minutes. The
    complainant testified that she and the appellant were dating when he committed
    the offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant testified at trial and
    denied the allegations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The jury convicted the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant’s single ground of appeal
    from conviction concerns the sequence in which the trial judge disposed of two
    of the applications he brought at trial: (i) a constitutional challenge to s.
    119(4) of the </span><em>Youth Criminal Justice Act</em><span style='line-height:
200%'>, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (the “</span><em>YCJA</em><span style='line-height:
200%'>”), which limits access to records concerning extrajudicial measures taken
    in respect of a young person; and (ii) a third party records application
    pursuant to s. 278.3 of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred by failing to first dispose of his constitutional challenge.
    Instead, the trial judge wrongly first dealt with and dismissed his s. 278.3
    third party records application and then treated his constitutional application
    as moot: 2016 ONSC 3825. The appellant’s argument centres on the manner in
    which the trial judge dealt with his request for disclosure of a record of
    extrajudicial measures (“EJM”) kept by the Durham Regional Police Service (the
    “Durham Police”) pursuant to s. 115(1.1) of the </span><em>YCJA.</em></p>

  <p class=Heading>THE EARLY STAGES OF THE APPELLANT’S s. 278.3 APPLICATION </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged in January 2013 and, following a preliminary inquiry,
    committed in March 2014 to stand trial. The appellant’s trial originally was
    scheduled to commence in June 2015.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>As part of his defence, the appellant intended to
    challenge the complainant’s credibility on the basis that, on an earlier
    occasion, she had falsely accused a fellow student, whom I will call “X”, of
    sexual assault.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>At an April 2015 appearance in the Superior Court of
    Justice, defence counsel advised that the appellant intended to make a s. 278.3
    third party records application and undertook to serve subpoenas on three third
    parties: the Durham Police; the school board in which the complainant was a
    student; and the local Children’s Aid Society. Although copies of the subpoenas
    were not in the appeal record, it appears they used language that sought
    documents and records relating to an investigation involving the complainant
    and allegations of inappropriate sexual activity with X.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>On a June 8, 2015 attendance, counsel for the Durham
    Police informed the court of the results of its searches made in response to
    the subpoena. The Durham Police filed with the court in a sealed envelope
    certain records and advised that it also possessed a record kept pursuant to
    the </span><em>YCJA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The Crown advised that it did not have possession of
    the </span><em>YCJA</em><span style='line-height:200%'> record nor had it been
    asked by the defence to inquire about the existence of any youth record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The defence indicated it would apply to the Youth
    Court for production of the youth record, and the trial date was adjourned.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>APPLICATION BEFORE THE YOUTH COURT</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 23, 2015, Felix J. of the Ontario Court of Justice, sitting as a Youth
    Court judge, heard the appellant’s application. The police had advised that
    they possessed a record maintained under s. 115(1.1) of the <em>YCJA</em> and
    the matter had been resolved by way of extrajudicial measures. Section 115(1.1)
    of the <em>YCJA</em> <span style='line-height:200%'>states: “The police force
    shall keep a record of any extrajudicial measures that they use to deal with
    young persons.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Section 2(1) of the </span><em>YCJA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> defines “extrajudicial measures” as “measures other
    than judicial proceedings under [the </span><em>YCJA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'>] used to deal with a young person alleged to have
    committed an offence and includes extrajudicial sanctions.” Brock Jones, Emma
    Rhodes, and Mary Birdsell, in </span><em>Prosecuting and Defending Youth
    Criminal Justice Cases</em>, 2nd ed<span style='line-height:200%'> (Toronto:
    Emond Montgomery Publications, 2019), at p. 135, describe the wide variety of
    EJM options available for police and prosecutors, including: making a simple
    decision to take no further action; giving the young person a warning; giving a
    more formal police or Crown caution to the young person; referring the young
    person to community resources or agencies; and, on a post-charge basis,
    allowing the young person to complete extrajudicial sanctions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>By the time of the application to the Youth Court,
    defence counsel had spoken to X and understood that X had never been charged in

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The Crown and the Durham Police took the position that
    s. 119(4) of the </span><em>YCJA</em><span style='line-height:200%'> prevented
    disclosure of the EJM record to the appellant. Section 119(4) of the </span><em>YCJA</em><span

    of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span style='line-height:200%'> initiated
    the previous year and a related s. 276 application, as well as a new
    application advancing a constitutional challenge to s. 119(4) of the </span><em>YCJA</em><span

    the limits placed on the production of EJM records by </span><em>YCJA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> s. 119(4) were unconstitutional because they
    infringed his rights under ss. 7 and 11(d) of the </span><em>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedom</em><span style='line-height:200%'>. The appellant sought
    a declaration that s. 119(4) of the </span><em>YCJA</em><span style='line-height:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant requested that the trial judge first
    dispose of his constitutional application before dealing with the third party
    records application <a name="_Hlk20130861">because he had not been successful
    in obtaining the EJM record from the Youth Court. </a>The appellant took the
    position that he did not know what was in the EJM record. But, if it turned out
    to contain information about a prior false allegation by the complainant, that
    would provide the appellant with a better evidentiary foundation for his s.
    278.3 application. Defence counsel wanted to marshal the best evidence in
    advance of arguing the s. 278.3 application.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>The applications were heard over three days. The trial
    judge first heard argument on the appellant’s constitutional application. For
    the first day and one-half, the appellant made his submissions based on the
    assumption that the EJM record in the hands of the police possibly involved a
    disposition using extrajudicial measures against the complainant for some
    discreditable conduct on her part, such as making a false allegation. </span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>Only towards the end of the second day of the hearing

    record relates and his or her counsel may have access to the record at any

    there were no records concerning extrajudicial measures used against the
    complainant. The record identified by the Durham Police in response to the appellant’s
    subpoena was in respect to someone other than the complainant but contained a

    extrajudicial measures used to deal with X, appellant’s counsel acknowledged
    that he had not properly served X with his s. 278.3 application. In the result,
    that lack of service did not matter. The trial judge heard the appellant’s
    third party records submissions on the assumption that the EJM record was a

    the theory of the defence regarding the relevance of the EJM record as follows,
    at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The defence theory with respect to the relevance of the records
    sought is as follows: </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that because of the strict religious convictions of the
    complainant’s family, she had a motive to deny that the sexual activity was
    consensual, when in fact it was;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that no charges were laid against the male youth;</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that the failure of the police to lay charges against the male
    youth may have been because the complainant recanted, or because her denial
    that the sexual activity was consensual had been shown to be demonstrably
    false; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that therefore, the records sought are likely relevant, and their

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span

    presumably by Mr. Rippell [trial counsel for the appellant]) that the young man

    upon information given by the “young man” to the friend of the young man, who
    gave it to the accused, who gave it to Mr. Rippell, who gave it to her).</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the affidavit of Marcia Collins sworn September 24, 2015,
    she swears that Mr. Rippell advised her: </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

  <p class=CQuote>In the absence of any explanation as to why the evidence
    contained in the Collins affidavits could not have been given by “the young man”,
    it is inadmissible hearsay. However, even if it were to be accepted as evidence
    on this application, and putting it at its highest, it says no more than that
    the male youth denied either that the incident had occurred, or that the sexual
    activity had been non-consensual – a wholly unremarkable response.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge first dealt with and dismissed the third party
    records application, holding that the appellant had not satisfied <a
name="_Hlk23947764">the first stage of the <em>Mills</em> regime test </a>–
    that is, the appellant had not established the records sought were likely
    relevant to an issue at trial. He wrote, at para. 32:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The evidence is that “something with a boy” had happened in the
    past, “some little, uh, thing, something that happened in the school” which was
    “not that serious”. There are any number of reasons why charges might not be
    laid in such circumstances. The police may simply have been unsure as to what actually
    took place, or may have concluded that what did take place was not particularly
    serious. And, under sections 4, 5 and 6 of the <em>YCJA</em>, a police officer
    is required to consider whether it would be sufficient to take no further
    action, warn the young person, administer a caution, or with the consent of the
    young person, refer him to a program or agency in the community that may assist
    him not to commit offences. The suggestion that the reason why no charges were
    laid against the male youth was that the complainant recanted amounts to
    nothing more than unfounded speculation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then considered and dismissed the constitutional application,
    holding, in part, that the application was moot in light of his dismissal of
    the third party records application: at paras. 38-46.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span

  <p class=Heading>REVISITING THE ISSUE DURING THE TRIAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence returned to the issue of the EJM record twice during trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>First, during her cross-examination, the complainant
    testified that her contact with the police in relation to the appellant was the
    first time she had ever talked to a police officer. The defence sought to
    impeach the complainant using the earlier matter involving X because, according
    to the complainant’s preliminary inquiry testimony, she appeared to have had
    some contact with the police at that time. In the ensuing argument about the
    permissible scope of the impeachment given the trial judge’s prior rulings
    about the EJM record, defence counsel repeated the arguments made on the
    constitutional application, but now in support of the position that questioning
    the complainant on her contact with the police in relation to the X matter
    would not violate </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span style='line-height:200%'> s. 276, which limits the scope of questioning on a complainant’s prior sexual
    history. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Defence counsel also informed the court that he was in
    contact with X’s father, had left a subpoena for X at his residence, and could
    get an affidavit from X’s father.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge ruled that the defence could attempt
    to impeach the complainant on certain evidence she gave at the preliminary
    inquiry but he could not ask her to describe the incident concerning X.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The second occasion occurred when the defence
    cross-examined the complainant about how the intercourse she alleged the
    appellant had initiated came to an end. The complainant testified that the
    appellant had ejaculated. She went on to state that she had never had sex
    before and did not know the signs of ejaculation. That prompted defence counsel
    to advise he intended to bring a s. 276 application on the basis that
    information he had about the event with X indicated it involved ejaculation.
    The defence did not proffer any new evidence that was not before the court at
    the time of the April applications, but offered to seek an affidavit from X.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge denied the defence’s request to bring a
    s. 276 application, stating that it was “no more than a fishing expedition”
    and, therefore, the renewed request for a constitutional exemption to look at
    the EJM record was moot.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>ISSUE ON APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant does not challenge the trial judge’s analysis on the
    first stage of the third party records application under the <em>Mills</em> regime. Instead, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred by first
    dealing with his s. 278.3 application and then dismissing his constitutional
    application as moot. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant argues that had the trial judge first
    dealt with his constitutional application, the evidence showed that the record
    contained information potentially relevant to the Crown’s prosecution of the
    appellant. As a result, the Crown was under a duty to obtain information about
    the relevance of the EJM record from the police for its consideration and
    disclosure to the appellant. Since </span><em>YCJA</em><span style='line-height:
200%'> s. 119(4) prevented the Crown from doing so, it violated the appellant’s
    s. 7 and s. 11(d) </span><em>Charter</em><span style='line-height:200%'> rights
    and was unconstitutional.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the state of the record that was before the trial judge, I am not persuaded
    that the trial judge’s analysis was tainted by reversible error. At the heart
    of the appellant’s argument lies the assertion that the sequence in which the
    trial judge determined the constitutional challenge to <em>YCJA</em> s. 119(4)
    and the <em>Criminal Code</em> s. 278.3 application improperly relieved the
    Crown of a legal obligation it otherwise bore to disclose or inquire into
    information. Neither the jurisprudence nor the evidence before the trial judge
    supports that assertion.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Crown’s duty to disclose</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under <em>R. v. Stinchcombe</em>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326, the Crown is obliged to
    disclose to the accused the fruits of the investigation, namely all relevant
    information in its possession relating to the investigation against an accused:
    at pp. 345-46; see also <em>R. v. McNeil</em>, 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66, at
    para. 22. Relevant information for this purpose includes any information in
    respect of which there is a reasonable possibility that it may assist the
    accused: <em>McNeil</em>, at paras. 17 and 44.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Further, the appellant’s argument before the trial
    judge proceeded on the basis that the EJM record was a “record” within the meaning
    of </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span style='line-height:200%'> s. 278.1, in
    that it contained personal information for which there was a reasonable
    expectation of privacy. Given that the charges against the appellant were
    sexual offences listed in s. 278.2(1)(a), even if the EJM record was in the
    Crown’s possession or control, s. 278.2(3) would limit the Crown’s obligation
    to one of notice, not disclosure: “In the case of a record in respect of which
    this section applies that is in the possession or control of the prosecutor,

    of the Crown’s obligation to make reasonable inquiries about evidence the
    following passage from the decision of Ryan J.A. in </span><em>R. v. Arsenault</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> (1994), 153 N.B.R. (2d) 81 (C.A.), where he stated,
    at para. 15: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>When disclosure is demanded or requested, Crown counsel have a
    duty to make reasonable inquiries of other Crown agencies or departments that
    could reasonably be considered to be in possession of evidence.  Counsel cannot
    be excused for any failure to make reasonable inquiries when to the knowledge
    of the prosecutor or the police there has been another Crown agency involved in
    the investigation. Relevancy cannot be left to be determined by the
    uninitiated. <span class=Underline>If Crown counsel is denied access to another
    agency’s file, then this should be disclosed to the defence so that the defence
    may pursue whatever course is deemed to be in the best interests of the
    accused.</span> This also applies to cases where the accused or defendant, as
    the case may be, is unrepresented[.] [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court went on to state that “[t]he same duty to inquire applies when
    the Crown is informed of potentially relevant evidence pertaining to the
    credibility or reliability of the witnesses in a case”: <em>McNeil</em>, at
    para. 50.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, knowledge about the existence of a document was not the
    issue. The defence came to know about the existence of an EJM record as a
    result of the subpoena it served on the Durham Police as part of its
    application under s. 278.3. However, <span style='line-height:200%'>the appellant
    argues that the Crown’s duty to inquire goes further than ascertaining the mere
    existence of a document. He points to the decision of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in </span><em>R. v. Quesnelle</em><span style='line-height:200%'>, 2014
    SCC 46, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 390, where the court observed that the </span><em>Mills</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> regime does not displace the Crown’s duty to inquire and
    assess potentially relevant material, stating, at para. 18:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>The Crown’s <em>McNeil</em> duty to make reasonable inquiries
    and the corresponding police duty to supply relevant information and evidence
    to the Crown apply notwithstanding the <em>Mills</em> regime. The <em>Mills</em> regime governs the <em>disclosure</em> of “records” in sexual offence trials,
    but does not displace the Crown’s duty to make reasonable inquiries and <em>obtain</em> potentially relevant material (or the police duty to pass on material to the
    Crown) under <em>McNeil</em>. As an officer of the court and Minister of
    Justice, the Crown is duty-bound to seek justice, not convictions, and to avoid
    wrongful convictions, in the prosecutions of all offences, including sexual
    offences. The <em>Mills</em> regime simply replaces the obligation to <em>produce</em> relevant records directly with an obligation to <em>give notice</em> of their
    existence: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 278.2(3). [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court stated that although s. 278.2(3) prevents the Crown from disclosing a s.
    278.1 “record” in its possession to the accused, “it should in appropriate
    circumstances give an assessment of the likely relevance of a record in its
    possession, as well as indicate the basis of its relevance” and whether “it
    intends to use any information contained in the records protected by <em>Mills</em> as part of its case against an accused”: at para. 16. As well, “[t]he Crown’s
    assessment that the record is relevant for a specific reason will likely
    establish a basis for the judge to order production to the court”: at para. 16.
    This court stated in <em>York (Regional Municipality) v. McGuigan</em>, 2018
    ONCA 1062, 144 O.R. (3d) 81, at para. 90, that the Crown owes this duty unless
    the notice it receives about material or information “appears unfounded”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span

style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that </span><em>YCJA</em><span
style='line-height:200%'> s. 119(4) prevents the Crown from discharging that
    aspect of its duty to inquire and assess potentially relevant material. As a
    result, the trial judge should have first dealt with the constitutionality of
    the limit imposed by statute on the Crown’s duty to inquire and assess. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case, <a

    appellant of an assessment of the relevance of the record by the Crown. </a>As
    applied to the circumstances raised by the present case, the Crown’s duty to
    inquire about and assess material is triggered when the Crown is informed of
    potentially relevant evidence pertaining to the credibility or reliability of
    the witnesses in a case: <em>McNeil</em>, at para. 50.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I accept the Crown’s submission </span>that nothing in <em>Mills</em>, <em>McNeil</em> or <em>Quesnelle</em> requires the Crown to
    obtain and review the contents of records that do not fall within the ambit of
    first party disclosure and that have not been shown to be potentially relevant.
    As the Crown points out, in <em>Quesnelle </em>the Supreme Court stated that
    “the mere fact that a police occurrence report concerns a complainant or
    witness is not enough to make the report relevant to an otherwise unrelated
    prosecution” and, as well, “the fact that a complainant has reported sexual
    violence in the recent or distant past […] is not, without more, enough to
    render a police occurrence report ‘relevant’”: at para. 17.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the appellant failed to demonstrate, on the evidence, that
    the EJM record was potentially relevant to an issue at the trial. Specifically,
    at paras. 27 and 28 of its factum, the Crown submits that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>With or without s. 119(4) the Crown would not have obtained and
    reviewed the youth record in this case because the appellant’s claim of
    relevance was unfounded.  Most of the “evidence” he produced amounted to
    nothing more than vague and unreliable hearsay.  The appellant had access to
    multiple sources of information.  His application failed because none [of]
    those sources revealed any relevant records.  The appellant received notice of
    the existence of the record.  He knew that it was not part of the case to
    meet.  He had access to the boy against whom he believed an allegation had been
    made.  That boy said nothing to suggest that his contact with police terminated
    because of recantation or proven falsehood.  The appellant had access to the
    complainant and her parents at the preliminary inquiry.  Their evidence did not
    suggest that the complainant had made a complaint to the police at all, let
    alone a demonstrably false or recanted one.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The only reliable evidence revealed nothing more than a father
    who had “found out” about “something” that was “not that serious” and had
    brought it to the attention of the police.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I accept, as accurate, that description by the Crown
    of the state of the record before the trial judge. I would add</span> that the
    trial record also discloses that as <span style='line-height:200%'>the argument
    of the applications unfolded, it became apparent that the EJM record was in
    respect of someone whom the defence believed to be X, not the complainant as
    the appellant initially submitted. Given the state of the record, it was open
    to the trial judge to not first dispose of the appellant’s constitutional
    challenge to </span><em>YCJA</em><span style='line-height:200%'> s. 119(4). The
    appellant failed to demonstrate that the EJM record contained potentially
    relevant material. The Crown’s duty to inquire and assess the material for
    relevance was not triggered. In those circumstances, </span><em>YCJA </em><span
style='line-height:200%'>s. 119(4) did not operate to deprive </span>the
    appellant of an assessment of the relevance of the record by the Crown, so the
    trial judge did not err by proceeding to first consider the production remedy
    sought by the appellant under the <em>Mills</em> regime, instead of determining
    the appellant’s constitutional challenge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>As mentioned, the appellant does not challenge the
    trial judge’s first-stage </span><em>Mills</em><span style='line-height:200%'> regime analysis. In that analysis, the trial judge considered the sufficiency
    of the evidentiary foundation laid by the appellant in support of his assertion
    that the reason no charges were laid against X was because the complainant had
    recanted her allegations. The trial judge concluded that suggestion was
    “nothing more than unfounded speculation”: at para. 32.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>On the facts of this case, the trial judge’s sequence
    of decision-making was not unfair to the appellant. As the trial judge pointed
    out, the evidence filed by the appellant on his s. 278.3 application disclosed
    that defence counsel had communicated with X, and it was open to the defence to
    obtain evidence from X regarding the details of the event that may have
    involved the complainant and then use that evidence in support of the third party
    records application: at paras. 35 and 36. In those circumstances, the appellant
    was not put in a catch-22 situation.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>Accordingly, given the specific facts of this case,
    the trial judge did not commit reversible error by first determining the appellant’s

  <p class=Heading align=center style='text-align:center'>PART III: SENTENCE
    APPEAL</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge imposed a global sentence of three years’ imprisonment, apportioned
    2.5 years to the sexual interference conviction and six months to the uttering
    death threats conviction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The appellant submits that the sentence was based on three
    errors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in concluding that the appellant “was in a position of trust and authority by
    virtue of his position at the church” and treating that circumstance as an aggravating
    factor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I see no error. The appellant was the son of the
    pastor of the church attended by the complainant and her parents, where he was involved
    in some activities involving the youth of the congregation. The complainant got
    to know the appellant through church activities. As the trial judge noted, the
    appellant groomed the complainant – who was 12 years his junior – by letting
    her think that he was her boyfriend, sent her sexually explicit text messages,
    and “took advantage of her crush on him to obtain sexual gratification.” In
    those circumstances, the trial judge made no error in characterizing the
    relationship as one of trust within the meaning of s. 718.2(a)(iii) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Second, the appellant submits that at para. 28 of his reasons
    for sentence, the trial judge erroneously treated as an aggravating factor the
    lack of any evidence that the appellant was suffering from a psychological
    disorder. I do not read that part of the reasons for sentence as making that
    suggestion. Instead, the trial judge merely observed, quite accurately, that in </span><em>R. v. D. (D.)</em><span style='line-height:200%'> (2002), 58 O.R.
    (3d) 788 (C.A.) this court stated, at para. 40, that the absence of evidence
    that an accused was suffering from some psycho-sexual disorder did not
    translate into a mitigating factor in his favour.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>Finally, the appellant contends that the trial judge
    erred by imposing a six-month custodial sentence on his conviction for uttering
    death threats. Instead, a fit sentence would have been a suspended sentence of
    one year, given the appellant’s youth and lack of a prior record.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>I see no error. The appellant, who was 12 years older
    than the 14-year old complainant, sent private Facebook messages to her that
    contained death threats. When the complainant started to tell people at their
    church that she was dating the appellant, he repeatedly told her to stop doing
    so. Ultimately, the appellant sent the complainant a message on October 8, 2012
    at 21:46 that stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Doooo u have any idea how piss I am</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I swear if u don’t go back and fix it I will kill u will be
    dead and I will be jail for real</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the complainant replied that she had shown the appellant’s father their messages
    discussing sex, the appellant said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>We don’t talk on hook [complainant’s name] I swear if u don’t
    clear my name I will kill u and I’m not joking cuss this is not funny seriously
    I don’t no what’s making u do this but I promise if u don’t I will kill u </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    the gravity of that language, the trial judge gave proper consideration to
    mitigating factors: the appellant’s good prospects for rehabilitation; his lack
    of a prior record; and the complainant’s evidence that she did not take
    seriously the appellant’s threats that he would kill her if she told her parents
    what he had done. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>The resulting sentence of six months for uttering
    death threats was not manifestly unfit in the circumstances. Nor was the global
    sentence of three years.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading align=center style='text-align:center'>PART IV: DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss the appeal
    from conviction. I would grant leave to appeal the sentence but dismiss the
    sentence appeal.</span></p>
