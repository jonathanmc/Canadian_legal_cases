  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted of child pornography
    offences and offences associated with the sexual touching of the victim (his
    daughter) in relation to three series of photographs that were found on the
    Internet depicting his daughter and parts of her body in a manner that amounted
    to child pornography. He was sentenced to four years in custody. He appealed
    his conviction alone. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We dismissed his appeal from conviction, with
    reasons to follow. These are those reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Upon searching the pornographic photographs
    found on the Internet for their exchangeable image file format data (“EXIFF data”),
    police discovered that the photographs were taken at the appellant’s residence,
    the appellant’s former partner’s residence, and two other locations accessible
    to the appellant. The appellant admitted to taking many of the “innocent”
    photographs of the victim that were found on the Internet, but denied taking
    the more egregious pornographic ones, and denied that he willfully distributed
    any of the photographs. He suggested that the victim’s mother and new boyfriend
    also had an opportunity to commit the offences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    evidence. He accepted that the appellant did not have an exclusive opportunity
    to take the photographs. However, he reasoned that the appellant’s contention
    that he had not taken all the photos depended on an improbable series of events
    being true: the “innocent” photos he admitted having taken having somehow being
    hacked from among the thousands of photos on his system before he deleted them
    becoming intermingled with a series of pornographic images of the same victim,
    taken in the same timeframe, by someone else who had access to the victim, his
    residence, the mother’s residence, and the aquatic centre he frequented with
    the victim. Applying <em>R. v. Villaroman</em>, 2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R.
    1000, he concluded that the circumstances were consistent with the appellant
    having committed the offences, and “there [were] no other reasonable,
    alternative inferences that either support the innocence of the [appellant], or
    more importantly, raise a reasonable doubt”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the appellant advanced two arguments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, he argued that the trial judge took
    improper judicial notice of the EXIFF data contained within the photographs to
    conclude that the photographs had not been cropped. He testified that he did not
    crop the photographs. He argues that, if some of the photographs were cropped, it
    suggests that the photos might have been taken by someone else. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reject this argument. The trial judge did not
    err in rejecting the appellant’s trial counsel’s submission that some of the
    photos were cropped. There was no evidence that the photos had been cropped.
    With respect to the EXIFF data, the trial judge simply noted that it suggests
    support for Police Constable Redgate’s tentative view that there was no
    cropping of the original iPhone pictures in issue. Moreover, even if the photos
    were cropped, there was no evidence, and it was not argued, that only the
    person who takes a photograph can crop it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant submits that the only
    concrete, relevant evidence in this almost exclusively circumstantial case was
    that the left adult-male hand that held the victim’s underwear aside in order
    to take a picture of the victim’s vagina that appeared in two of the sexually
    explicit photos had a mole on it, and the appellant did not have a mole on his
    left hand. A reasonable inference was that the adult with a mole on his hand,
    and not the appellant, took all the photos. The appellant submits that the
    trial judge erred by treating the evidence of the mole as “neutral”, and, in
    the result, erred in his application of <em>Villaroman</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We reject this argument. The evidence on whether
    the appellant had a mole or spot on his hand at the time of the offences was
    equivocal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Officer Power testified about the left adult-male
    hand depicted in the two photographs and indicated she saw a dark spot she
    believed to be a mole. She also observed that some photos from the appellant’s
    Facebook page depicted what she believed to be the appellant’s hand bearing the
    same mole. However, when she interviewed him, she did not see the dark mark.
    Rather, she observed a white mark on his hand in roughly the same location as
    the mole in the pictures. She explained that in her experience as a victim
    identification officer, marks on hands can change. Dark moles can lose
    pigmentation and become white. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant accepted in cross-examination that
    one of the photos from his Facebook page depicted his hand and showed a mole on
    his hand. He also testified that the hand depicted in another photo from his
    Facebook account was not his, “because mine does not have a mole”. However, in
    his police statement, the appellant had admitted that that photo depicted his
    hand. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge considered the Facebook
    photographs of the appellant’s hand and the hand that appeared in the two
    sexually explicit photos. He noted that the appellant’s answers were “quite
    contradictory”.  He concluded that, based on the photos, he was not able to
    form any sort of opinion as to similarity. Further, he concluded it would be
    inappropriate to allow in the evidence of the police officer “as to finger
    similarity”.  Accordingly, he placed “no reliance on any similarity that may or
    may not exist” either to support a finding that the hand was that of the
    appellant or of someone else.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The assessment of what the photographs showed
    was a question of fact for the trial judge. It was open to him to find that the
    evidence was not sufficiently cogent to support any conclusion on identity.
    There is no basis to interfere with his conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.</span></p>
