    of Rights and Freedoms</em> seeking to exclude two paragraphs from the Record
    of the Case (“ROC”), relied on in support of the extradition of the appellant,
    Akohomen Ighedoise,</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

lang=EN-US> to the United States. The paragraphs summarize information obtained
    from searches of certain electronic devices of the appellant and his co-accused.
    These searches were authorized by warrants obtained in reliance on information
    from an iPhone that was examined and later seized from the appellant in the
    course of his preclearance for travel to the United States</span><span
lang=EN-US>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a

    appellant to be committed for extradition. The committal judge dismissed the

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the
    examination of the appellant’s iPhone by the U.S. Customs preclearance officer
    violated s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. I would allow the appeal and set aside
    the committal order. I would order that the committal judge hold another extradition
    hearing to determine: (1) whether the evidence obtained in violation of the <em>Charter</em> must be excluded from the ROC under s. 24(2); and (2) if the evidence is
    excluded, whether there is sufficient evidence to order the appellant’s
    committal. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On August 21, 2014, the appellant, a Canadian
    citizen, was scheduled to board a flight from Toronto to Atlanta, Georgia. He
    presented himself to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials in the
    preclearance area at Pearson Airport. He was directed to secondary inspection,
    where he was questioned and his baggage and belongings were searched. During
    the search, a U.S. Customs preclearance officer located two cell phone SIM
    cards attached to contracts in names other than the appellant’s, as well as a
    credit card in a different name. The appellant provided explanations that, in
    response to further questioning by the officer, he admitted were false. The
    officer then examined the appellant’s iPhone and found what he believed was
    evidence of fraudulent activity. He contacted the Peel Regional Police, who
    arrested the appellant and charged him with offences under the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a

    appellant and his co&#8209;accused on these and other charges, the Canadian
    authorities obtained warrants authorizing their searches of the devices that
    were seized on the appellant’s arrest and devices seized subsequently from the appellant’s
    and the co-accused’s residences. The warrants were based in part on two
    informations to obtain (“ITOs”) sworn in October 2014 and October 2015. The
    October 2014 ITO included the preclearance officer’s statements and notes about
    his interactions with the appellant in the preclearance area and the
    information he had seen on the appellant’s iPhone. The October 2015 ITO stated
    that the appellant was refused entry to the United States subsequent to the
    examination of the iPhone and explained what became of the appellant’s devices
    seized upon his arrest.</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The United States sought the appellant’s extradition
    to face fraud charges in that country. The U.S. authorities relied on the ROC,
    which contained the two impugned paragraphs summarizing what was found in the
    forensic analysis of the electronic devices of the appellant and his
    co-accused. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence on the <em>Charter</em> application
    consisted of an application record filed by the appellant (and his co-accused,
    who is not involved in this appeal) and the ROC. The application record
    contained the two ITOs and an affidavit sworn by the appellant. There was no
    cross-examination on the affidavit nor was any oral evidence called at the
    hearing. As noted by the committal judge, the parties were content to proceed
    with the <em>Charter</em> application based on this evidence.<a href="#_ftn2"

  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>charter</em> application before the committal judge</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before the committal judge the appellant
    asserted that: (1) his rights under s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em> were violated
    by the preclearance officer’s warrantless search of his iPhone; (2) he had been
    arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>; (3) his rights
    under s. 8 were violated when no report to a justice was filed following the
    seizure of his iPhone by a Peel Regional Police officer; and (4) under s. 24(2)
    of the <em>Charter</em>, the two impugned paragraphs in the ROC should be
    excluded from the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the first s. 8 argument, the committal judge
    concluded that the preclearance officer was authorized to conduct, without
    warrant, the limited search of the appellant’s iPhone that revealed the
    information leading to the two impugned paragraphs. He determined that the
    preclearance officer was continuing to assess the appellant’s admissibility to
    the United States when he searched the iPhone, and that he was not examining
    the iPhone for a criminal law investigation purpose. The committal judge reasoned
    that the officer was entitled to consider the appellant’s criminality in
    determining his admissibility to the United States, and that the officer’s belief
    that the appellant had lied to him about the reason for his travel to the
    United States and for the false names on the SIM cards led him to inspect the
    iPhone for confirmation of his concerns. The committal judge concluded at para.
    50 of his reasons that, “[w]hatever [the preclearance officer’s] precise reason
    for inspecting the iPhone may have been, it was entirely permissible for him to
    do so in order to assist him in determining whether, under United States
    immigration law, [the appellant] should be permitted to enter the United
    States.” Indeed, the committal judge noted that, once the officer determined
    that the iPhone contained evidence of criminality, he discontinued his
    examination of it, refused the appellant admission, and contacted the Peel
    Regional Police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In dismissing the first s. 8 argument, the
    committal judge rejected the submission that a preclearance officer who
    believes on reasonable grounds that the traveller has contravened s. 33 of the <em>Preclearance</em> <em>Act</em>, S.C. 1999, c. 20<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> (providing a false or deceptive statement), or committed a criminal offence,
    must at that point “hold off” from conducting any further search and deliver
    the traveller and any detained goods into the custody of the Canadian police. In
    the committal judge’s view, the development of reasonable grounds does not
    bring to an end the officer’s powers in relation to determining the traveller’s
    admissibility to the United States. Rather, as in this case, the committal
    judge accepted that the preclearance officer completed his preclearance
    functions only after he examined the appellant’s iPhone, and then denied him
    entry into the United States.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the s. 9 issue, the committal judge concluded
    that the officer had reasonable grounds to detain the appellant for breach of
    s. 33 of the <em>Preclearance</em> <em>Act</em>. Given that the officer knew
    that the appellant had both SIM cards and a credit card in his possession in
    the name of other persons, and was aware of a constellation of other
    incriminating facts, the officer “unquestionably had reasonable grounds to
    believe that [the appellant] had contravened s. 33, and on the evidence could
    not have thought otherwise”: para. 89.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the third issue, the committal judge was not
    convinced, on a balance of probabilities, that there had been a contravention
    of s. 489.1(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> when the authorities
    failed to file a report with a justice following the seizure of the appellant’s
    iPhone at Pearson Airport. However, he concluded that if he was wrong, and if
    this was a <em>Charter</em> breach, the violation was a small one. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, on the fourth issue, the committal
    judge conducted a s. 24(2) analysis only with respect to the failure to report,
    not the iPhone search. After balancing the <em>Grant</em> factors (<em>R. v.
    Grant</em>, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353), and assuming there was a breach,
    he concluded that the evidence in question should not be excluded. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant, with the assistance of duty
    counsel, makes two arguments on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the appellant says that the committal
    judge erred by inferring that the preclearance officer was still deciding
    whether to grant him entry into the United States when he searched his phone.
    The appellant contends that the officer’s search was motivated by a criminal
    law purpose, not the determination of whether to grant him entry, and therefore
    violated s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em>. According to the appellant, the
    committal judge engaged in impermissible speculation about the officer’s
    motivations in the absence of evidentiary support. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the appellant argues that the search of
    his iPhone contravened s.&nbsp;8 of the <em>Charter</em> because, once he was
    detained for having committed an offence under s. 33 of the <em>Preclearance
    Act</em>, the preclearance officer was obliged to turn him over immediately to Canadian
    officials and had no authority to continue the search of his belongings. </span></p>

  <h3>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the Committal Judge Err in Concluding that the Preclearance Officer

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant's first argument on appeal is that
    the committal judge’s conclusion that the preclearance officer was continuing
    his preclearance activities when he searched the iPhone was unreasonable, not
    supported by the evidence, and speculative. The appellant argues that there was
    no evidence as to why the officer searched the phone and that, given that the
    officer already knew that the appellant had lied about his reason for
    travelling to the United States and about the false names on the SIM cards, his
    search was motivated by a criminal law purpose. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree that the officer would have had no
    authority to search the phone for a criminal law purpose. The authority of a
    preclearance officer is limited to the administration of preclearance laws,
    and, as the committal judge noted at para. 7 of his reasons, does not extend to
    the administration of criminal law. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The committal judge, at paras. 52-66 of his
    reasons, initially assumed the accuracy of the appellant’s evidence that the
    officer told him that he would be calling the police when he discovered the
    credit card, and before he examined the cell phone. Relying on cases such as <em>R.
    v. Nolet,</em> 2010 SCC 24, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 851, and <em>R. v. Annett </em>(1984),
    17 C.C.C. (3d) 332 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1985] S.C.C.A. No.
    222, the committal judge concluded that the officer could have had both a
    regulatory purpose and a criminal law purpose when he examined the cell phone,
    and that whether the officer suspected or believed that the appellant had
    committed a crime would not bring to an end his statutory authority. In my view,
    however, the <em>Nolet</em> and <em>Annett</em> cases, which are authority that
    a concurrent interest in potential criminal activity does not convert a legal
    search for a regulatory purpose into an unlawful search, are not applicable to
    the present context, given that the preclearance officer’s authority is limited
    to the administration of preclearance laws, which do not include the criminal
    law. </span></p>

    I might have concluded that effect should be given to this ground of appeal.
    However, the committal judge went on in his reasons to make findings as to the
    preclearance officer’s actual purpose when he examined the appellant’s iPhone.
    He concluded that the officer was not pursuing a criminal law purpose and that
    he was in fact continuing his preclearance functions. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As the committal judge explained, the parties
    were content to argue the application on the basis of the documents placed
    before him without the need for <em>viva voce</em> evidence: at para. 72. The
    documents included the ROC, the two ITOs and the appellant’s affidavit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the committal judge noted that the
    affiant of the October 2015 ITO stated that the preclearance officer refused
    the appellant’s entry to the United States <em>subsequent</em> to his
    examination of the iPhone: para. 70. Second, he relied on the October 2014 ITO
    to conclude that the officer was still completing his preclearance
    responsibilities when he examined the iPhone. He explained that the affiant
    reviewed the officer’s notes and, based on the notes, the officer formed the
    belief that the appellant was engaged in fraud when he examined the phone’s
    text messages. The officer then stopped searching the device and called the
    police. He also refrained from examining the appellant’s other electronic
    devices. Third, the committal judge rejected the appellant’s evidence, in his
    affidavit, that the officer told him that the credit card was fraudulent and
    that he would be calling the police prior to examining the phone. He reasoned
    that it was far more logical that the officer first thought he had reasonable grounds
    to believe the appellant was engaged in criminal activity when he discovered
    the text messages on the phone: at para. 71. In other words, reasonable grounds
    developed during, but not before, the search. This was consistent with the fact
    that the officer stopped searching the phone after examining the messages, his
    decision to refrain from examining any of the appellant’s other devices, and
    his call to the police at that time.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s second argument is that, once
    the officer had determined that he had made a false and deceptive statement
    contrary to s. 33 of the <em>Preclearance</em> <em>Act</em>, he was detained.
    At that point, the preclearance officer was required to turn him over to the
    Canadian authorities, was no longer authorized to continue his preclearance
    activities, and accordingly had no authority to continue to search his iPhone. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue of detention was considered by the
    committal judge at paras. 86 to 91 of his reasons in determining whether the
    appellant was arbitrarily detained under s. 9 of the <em>Charter</em>. The
    committal judge referred to the appellant’s affidavit where he swore that, when
    he was asked for the password to his phone, he asked the officer if he could
    return his belongings and leave the airport and was told that was not possible.
    This evidence, which was not contradicted, and was not rejected by the
    committal judge, was also mentioned at para. 30. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The committal judge rejected the argument that the
    appellant’s detention was unlawful. He referred to s. 24(1) of the <em>Preclearance</em> <em>Act</em>, authorizing the detention of a traveller if the officer
    reasonably believes the traveller has contravened s. 33 or committed an offence
    under an Act of Parliament. He concluded that, before searching the phone, the
    preclearance officer “unquestionably had reasonable grounds to believe that [the
    appellant] had contravened s. 33, and on the evidence could not have thought
    otherwise”: at para.&nbsp;89. While there was no evidence that the officer
    turned his mind to the issue before searching the phone, “[w]hether or not the
    officer had reasonable grounds to believe that [the appellant] had committed a
    criminal offence, he had the authority to detain [the appellant] in relation to
    a contravention of s. 33”: at para.&nbsp;90. </span></p>

    to detain the appellant on the basis of his false statement is not
    determinative of whether he was detained when the iPhone was examined. Section
    24(1) of the <em>Preclearance</em> <em>Act</em> is permissive: a preclearance
    officer may detain any traveller if the officer believes on reasonable grounds
    that the traveller has contravened s. 33 or an Act of Parliament. </span></p>

    for the committal judge to have concluded that, while the preclearance officer
    had the authority to detain the appellant before searching the phone, he was
    not in fact detained. On the record in this case however, the appellant had to
    have been detained at the point when, having been asked for the password to his
    cell phone, he sought to take his belongings and to leave the airport. This is
    the only possible conclusion on the evidence: see <em>Grant</em>, at paras.
    30-31. The appellant’s uncontroverted evidence, which was not rejected by the
    committal judge, was that he was told his iPhone would be seized and that he
    could not leave the preclearance area when he asked to do so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s counsel did not take the
    position in the appeal that the appellant was not detained when his iPhone was
    searched. Rather, he argued that, notwithstanding the appellant’s detention,
    the officer’s powers of investigation for the purpose of his preclearance
    activities continued. </span></p>

    arising simply on having reasonable grounds, clearly arises on detention.</span></p>

    officer to continue to inquire into the traveller’s admissibility to the United
    States – the traveller must be turned over to Canadian authorities, making admissibility,
    in effect, moot. Practically speaking, the officer’s preclearance
    responsibilities ended at that point. There was no reasonable prospect of the
    appellant’s admission to the United States if he was being detained in Canada
    for violation of s. 33.</span></p>

    the United States, the preclearance officer was authorized to continue his
    preclearance inquiries of the appellant, including the examination of his cell
    phone, because the officer could decide not just whether to refuse him
    admission on this one occasion, but whether he would be inadmissible to the United
    States for some longer period. There was no basis in the evidence for this
    assertion – and no evidence of the U.S. preclearance law that might support
    such an argument. In the absence of such evidence, it would be improper to
    speculate that U.S. preclearance laws may support continued inquiries of a
    traveller who has been detained and must be turned over to Canadian officials
    as soon as possible.</span></p>

    are limited to those set out in the <em>Preclearance</em> <em>Act</em>. There
    is nothing in the evidence before this court to suggest that once a traveller
    has been detained, there is any authority to continue preclearance activities.
    Rather, at that point, the obligation is to hand over the traveller to the
    Canadian authorities. Any subsequent search of the traveller’s cell phone is therefore
    unlawful. </span></p>
