  <p class=Heading>INTRODUCTION </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on two charges of
    sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge (“SCAJ”)
    committed two errors. The SCAJ erred in holding that the trial judge did not rely
    on impermissible myths and stereotypes about the behaviour of sexual assault
    victims in assessing the complainant’s credibility. The SCAJ also erred in
    concluding that the trial judge’s reasonable doubt analysis was not tainted by
    his reliance on such myths and stereotypes such that it did not have a
    sufficient nexus to the verdict.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the trial judge considered the proper
    factors and did not make any unreasonable finding. His credibility finding
    should be accorded deference on appellate review. The Crown is inviting this
    court to re-try the case and that is not the function of this court. In oral
    argument, the respondent accepted that if the trial judge did wrongly rely on
    stereotypical reasoning in his credibility assessment, it would inevitably have
    affected his assessment of the evidence as a whole.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>Background Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant and the respondent were tenants in an adult assisted
    care residence for persons with disabilities. Each resident had their own room.
    The complainant alleged that the respondent sexually assaulted her on two
    consecutive days on April 18 and 19, 2015. At trial, the version of events described
    by the complainant and the respondent differed. The trial judge identified
    credibility and reliability as the sole issue(s) in the case. The complainant
    asserted that the respondent touched her in a sexual way without her consent;
    the respondent testified that he did not touch the complainant in a sexual way
    without her consent. Consent lay at the heart of the case.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Complainant’s Testimony</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the first alleged assault, the complainant testified
    that the respondent knocked on her room door and invited her to go out for a
    cigarette. She agreed and the two of them then went outside onto the fire
    escape. She was dressed in a sleeveless pyjama top and bottom, and wore no bra
    or underwear. They smoked and engaged in small talk. According to the
    complainant, the respondent then began to touch her breasts and pinch her nipples.
    She told the respondent to stop a few times, but he refused to do so, and laughed
    each time she asked him to stop. He then put his hands inside her pants and
    played with her clitoris. He also French kissed her. She testified that she
    kissed him back because he was not listening to her, and she was scared he
    would hit her. They then left and the complainant went back to her room where
    she realized her clitoris was bleeding. She told no one about these events and
    made no report to the police. Her explanation was that she was terrified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following evening, the second alleged assault took place in the same
    location. According to the complainant, the respondent again came to her
    bedroom and asked if she wanted to go out onto the fire escape and smoke
    cigarettes. They did so. The complainant was wearing different pyjamas with a
    loose top and short bottoms, and wore no bra or underwear. She testified that the
    respondent touched her breasts again, pinched her nipples harder, put his hand
    down her pants, and rubbed her clitoris hard. She told the respondent to stop several
    times and told him to get his hands out of her pants. While this was going on, the
    respondent asked the complainant to touch and play with his penis and masturbate
    him. She declined to do so and he got mad. He then started French kissing her.
    She testified that she kissed him back because she was scared that if she did not,
    he would get mad and hit her. They then left and the complainant went back to
    her room.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Days after the second incident, the complainant advised her boyfriend
    and a girlfriend what had occurred. They advised her to call the police. She
    did so, and a police officer attended and questioned her. She also attended at
    the police station and gave a video statement.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that she did not call the police immediately
    because she did not know what to do at the time. She moved out of the residence
    about a month after the incidents.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the complainant testified that she did not want or expect the
    sexual contact she had with the respondent. She denied the respondent’s version
    of events.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondent’s Testimony</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For his part, the respondent testified that the complainant had come to
    his room, knocked, and entered. She lifted up her shirt, played with her
    breasts, and invited the respondent to touch her breasts. He touched the
    complainant’s breasts as she asked, but then as she started to take her clothes
    off, he stopped her and they went out onto the fire escape to smoke cigarettes.
    Outside, the complainant asked to see the respondent’s penis, which he showed
    her, but she was disappointed because it was small. The respondent denied
    pinching the complainant’s breasts, putting his hands down her pants, touching
    her clitoris, or French kissing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the following evening, the respondent testified that he met the complainant
    in the hallway, gave her a “peck on the lips”, and they went their own ways.
    The respondent denies pinching the complainant’s breasts, reaching inside her
    pants, touching her clitoris, or French kissing. To the extent there was any
    touching that involved any sexuality, it was consensual.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The respondent testified that he was heavily medicated, and that one of
    the medication’s side effects was that he had no sex drive. It was very
    difficult for him to obtain an erection and he had “very seldom” had erections
    in the past 15 years.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was subsequently charged with two counts of sexual
    assault.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial Judge’s Reasons</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge acquitted the respondent. In his oral reasons, he
    identified credibility and reliability as the sole issue(s) in the case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge noted that the rule of reasonable doubt applies to the
    issue of credibility, and that triers of fact are not to treat the standard of
    proof as a credibility contest between Crown and defence witnesses. He
    correctly instructed himself that he had a duty to assess the accused’s
    evidence in light of all the evidence, including that of the complainant: <i>R.
    v. Hull</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 3177, at paras. 4-5. He noted that it would be
    open to him to be satisfied of the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
    following careful consideration of the complainant’s evidence along with the
    credibility enhancing effects of any other evidence:<i> R. v. J.J.R.D. </i>(2006),
    215 C.C.C. (3d) 252. He observed that this case fell “squarely” within the
    principles identified in <i>Hull</i> and <i>J.J.R.D</i>.<i> </i>He also
    instructed himself on the principles set forth in <em>R. v. W.D.</em>, [1991] 1
    S.C.R. 742.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to his analysis. He noted that if he were to
    accept the complainant’s evidence in isolation, he could find the respondent
    guilty of the offences with which he was charged, but he had to consider all of
    the evidence in the case. He proceeded to summarize that evidence, and then
    listed 11 factors that he described as not being determinative, but nonetheless
    significant to the case:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative of the issue it is significant that
    when Richard Lacombe began to touch [the complainant’s] breasts and nipples on
    the first occasion, April the 18<sup>th</sup>, and she told him to stop and he
    would not, she did not immediately leave or withdraw.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative it is significant that when Richard
    Lacombe put his hands inside the pants of [the complainant] and began to rub
    her clitoris without her consent, she did not leave, she remained.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While it is not determinative it is significant that when
    Richard Lacombe engaged in French kissing [the complainant], she did not
    immediately stop and leave or say no. She did none of that.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While it is not determinative it is significant that she said
    that she remained with Richard Lacombe and continued to French kiss him putting
    her tongue into his mouth.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative it is significant that these events
    occurred on a fire escape outside the building in which they live and the
    events continued for some considerable period of time. [The complainant] was
    unable to say for how long, or even how the events ended.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative it is significant that [the complainant]
    presented herself to Richard Lacombe dressed in a loose fitting pyjama top with
    no bra and underwear, engaging with a man that she really did not know well at
    all, including significant French kissing.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative it is significant that upon returning
    to her bedroom she became aware of the fact that Richard Lacombe had actually
    injured her sexually by rubbing her clitoris and noted that it had been
    bleeding. She said she was terrified. No medical assistance was provided, no
    medical evidence was tendered at court. This incident was not reported at that
    time to friends, or to staff, or to the police.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Context is important because there was a second incident that
    occurred on April the 19<sup>th</sup>.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative it is significant that [the complainant]
    the very next night accepted another invitation from Richard Lacombe to
    re-attend with him on the same fire escape to smoke, an invitation from a man
    who on her earlier evidence had sexually assaulted her the night before.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative it is significant that the next night
    April the 19<sup>th</sup>, [the complainant] was dressed in a loose pyjama top
    with no bra, shorty pants, PJ pants, and no underwear, and was quite prepared
    to go down the hallway and out onto the fire escape and smoke cigarettes with Richard
    Lacombe.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While not determinative it is significant that [the complainant]
    alleges that Richard Lacombe engaged in much the same sort of behaviour on
    April 19<sup>th</sup> that he had on April 18<sup>th</sup>, but pinched her
    breasts and nipples harder, and she did not leave.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While it is not determinative it is significant that [the
    complainant] was with Richard Lacombe for about an hour during which period of
    time they again engaged in French kissing voluntarily in which both Richard
    Lacombe put his tongue into the mouth of [the complainant], and she put her
    tongue into the mouth of Richard Lacombe.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having recited these non-determinative significant factors, the trial
    judge then concluded that he was troubled by the reliability of the
    complainant’s evidence: “Common sense and life experiences would comport with
    the notion that something was happening on April 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> between [the complainant] and Richard Lacombe, but not as [the complainant]
    would have this court believe.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then turned to the respondent’s testimony, stating that “[h]is
    evidence was troubled with some inconsistencies and contradictions internally
    in terms of other evidence at trial and his statements to the police.” The
    trial judge stated that there was nothing in the respondent’s evidence that
    would allow him to conclude that the respondent was lying about the degree of
    contact that he had with the complainant; despite weaknesses in the
    respondent’s evidence, the trial judge could not reject his evidence of denial
    of sexual assaults.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quoting from Martin J.A.’s observation in <em>R. v. Nimchuk</em> (1977),
    33 C.C.C. (2d) 209 (Ont. C.A.), that an acquittal should ensue if a reasonable
    doubt exists in view of the conflicting testimony as to exactly where the truth
    of the matters lay, the trial judge acquitted the respondent of the two
    charges. The trial judge did say that he may provide more detailed written
    reasons to incorporate some of the evidence, but this does not appear to have
    occurred.</p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Summary Conviction Appeal Judge’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appealed, arguing that the trial judge’s analysis was tainted
    by reliance on discredited stereotypical assumptions and biases about how
    victims of sexual assault behave.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ noted that the Crown’s burden was to establish an error of law,

    there would not necessarily have been an acquittal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ succinctly and properly observed that there was a consensus
    about the following:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Complainants are entitled to reliance on a system free from discredited

    impartiality is not compromised by biased assumptions;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant’s clothing is no indication of willingness to engage in sexual
    relations; going somewhere alone with a man does not signify consent; fear of
    violence vitiates consent; consent is required for each incident of sexual
    contact; passivity is not consent;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing credibility the timing of the complaint is simply one circumstance to

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that myths and stereotypes about
    sexual assault victims have no place in a rational and just system of law.
    Relying on myths and stereotypes to assess the credibility of complainants
    jeopardizes the court's truth-finding function: <em>R. v. A.G.</em>, 2000 SCC
    17, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 439, at para. 2. As Lamer C.J.C. explained in <em>R. v.
    Osolin</em>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at pp. 624-625:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Historically, a host of factors were deemed relevant to the
    credibility of complainants in sexual assault trials that did not bear on the
    credibility of witnesses in any other trial and which functioned to the
    prejudice of victims of sexual assault. In <em>Seaboyer</em>, <em>supra</em>, I
    discussed at length the hurdles that complainants faced in sexual assault
    trials due to these unfounded presumptions. … These myths suggest that women by
    their behaviour or appearance may be responsible for the occurrence of sexual
    assault. …They suggest that the presence of certain emotional reactions and
    immediate reporting of the assault, despite all of the barriers that might
    discourage such reports, lend credibility to the assault report, whereas the
    opposite reactions lead to the conclusion that the complainant must be
    fabricating the event. Furthermore, they are built on the suggestion that
    women, out of spite, fickleness or fantasy and despite the obvious trauma for
    victims in many, if not most, sexual assault trials, are inclined to lie about
    sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span

    (6th) 374, at para. 60:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Broadly speaking, myths and stereotypes rest on untested and
    unstated assumptions about how the world works or how certain people behave in
    particular situations. They often involve an idealized standard of conduct
    against which particular individuals are measured. Sometimes general, assumed
    or attributed characteristics are applied to a particular individual or circumstance,

    assumption or whether it truly applies in a particular situation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, the trial judge identified credibility and reliability
    as the sole issue(s) in the case. In assessing those issues as they related to the
    complainant, the trial judge turned to factors, each of which he described as
    significant, but not determinative. Almost all these factors relied by
    implication on long-discredited myths and stereotypes about sexual assault
    complainants.</p>
  <h4>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dress</h4>

    “presented herself to Richard Lacombe dressed in a loose-fitting pyjama top
    with no bra and underwear”. He again referenced her clothing as being
    significant when addressing the second encounter the following evening, when he
    stated that it was significant that the complainant “was dressed in a loose
    pyjama top with no bra, shorty pants, PJ pants, and no underwear”. The trial
    judge did not explain how the complainant’s dress could have been significant.</p>

  <p class=CQuote>However, strong, sometimes biased, assumptions about sexual
    behaviour are not new to sexual assault trials. Traditional myths and
    stereotypes have long tainted the assessment of the conduct and veracity of
    complainants in sexual assault cases – the belief that women of&nbsp;“unchaste”
    character are more likely to have consented or are less worthy of belief; that
    passivity or even resistance may in fact constitute consent; and that some
    women invite sexual assault by reason of their dress or behaviour, to name only
    a few. Based on overwhelming evidence from relevant social science literature,
    this Court has been willing to accept the prevailing existence of such myths
    and stereotypes: see, for example, <em>Seaboyer</em>, <em>supra</em>; <em>R. v.

    the respondent on both occasions because she was scared that he would hit her
    and, that on the second occasion when she refused to ‘masturbate’ him, he got
    mad.  When asked why she would have allowed a second occurrence, she replied
    that she was scared that the respondent would hit her. The trial judge did not include
    these facts in his enumeration of significant factors, nor did he reject the
    complainant’s testimony in this regard. Rather, he considered it significant that
    the complainant did not leave in spite of telling the respondent to stop.</span></p>

    are apt to behave: <i>R. v. Kiss</i>, 2018 ONCA 184, at para. 101. The trial

    was comparing her conduct to conduct he expected of a sexual assault
    complainant without giving any consideration to her evidence of fear. </span></p>
  <h4>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cumulative effect of “significant” factors</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge engaged in reasoning that for the most
    part attached significance to factors that were insignificant. </span>Importantly,
    the trial judge relied on substantially nothing else in assessing the
    complainant’s credibility; the listed factors constituted the trial judge’s
    analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, no explanation was given by the trial judge as to why the
    factors he enumerated and clearly relied upon were significant. Any
    significance to be attributed to these factors was anchored in assumptions that
    failed to reveal anything about the complainant's credibility and reliability. Nothing
    could be drawn from the trial judge's determination that it was significant that
    the complainant “presented herself” to the respondent “dressed in a loose
    fitting pyjama top with no bra and underwear”, or that although she testified
    that she was terrified, the first incident was not reported at the time to
    friends, staff, or the police. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ’s conclusion that the trial judge was entitled to rely on the
    complainant’s dress because her loose clothing was relevant to the respondent’s
    evidence that she exposed her breasts to the respondent does not pass muster.
    The trial judge’s language does not reflect such an interpretation either
    expressly or inferentially.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a similar vein, nor does the SCAJ’s supposition that “[t]he
    references to the complainant’s attire and behaviours in the trial judge’s
    reasons were equally consistent to a general finding or statement that
    behavioural changes in the complainant ‘would not be unexpected’” withstand
    scrutiny. The trial judge made no such comment and his reasons simply do not
    bear that interpretation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After listing these factors, the trial judge then invoked “common sense
    and life experiences” to conclude that he should reject the complainant’s
    testimony. This is the precise discredited reasoning identified in cases like <i>Find </i>and <i>A.R.D</i>. As McLachlin C.J.C. wrote in <i>Find</i>, at para. 103:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>These myths and stereotypes about child and adult complainants
    are particularly invidious because they comprise part of the fabric of social “common
    sense” in which we are daily immersed. Their pervasiveness, and the subtlety of
    their operation, create the risk that victims of abuse will be blamed or
    unjustly discredited in the minds of both judges and jurors.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in <em>A.R.D</em><i>., </i>Paperny and Schutz JJ.A. wrote, at
    para. 9, “to suggest that stereotypical thinking is merely logic or common
    sense is a licence for it to continue unmasked and unabated.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s ultimate reliance on “common sense and life experiences”
    did not cleanse his assessment as his common-sense inferences reflected
    stereotypical sexual and myth-based reasoning. They infected his consideration
    of the complainant’s evidence and his assessment of reasonable doubt. His
    conclusions were the product of legally flawed reasoning. Again, “reasonable
    doubt is not a shield for appellate review if that doubt is informed by
    stereotypical and therefore prejudicial reasoning”: <em>A.R.D</em>, at para. 9.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That recourse to “common sense” also was coloured by improper
    considerations is evident from the following exchange between the trial judge
    and the Crown:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crown:  […] And
    upon going back inside, she realized that her clitoris was bleeding and that
    she saw that bleeding occur for approximately five seconds.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Court:    So
    she immediately reports this to the staff and to the police, does she?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crown:  No, Your Honour, doesn’t re  … .</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Court:    She
    goes out with a virtual stranger onto a – on a – on a fire escape with no bra,
    no underpants, and would – how many times you – you have asked me to use common
    sense.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crown:  Right.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Court:    How
    many times would it take for this kind of touching to take place before such a
    person would get out of that situation immediately? Would it take one or two,
    five, eight, how many would it take?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crown:  Frankly, I don’t know, Your Honour.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Court:    No, I
    don’t either, but common sense tells me not much.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crown:  Common sense tells me not much as well.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Court:    All,
    right, okay. So we’ve got French kissing, touching nipples.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crown:  And that she kissed back …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Court:   And she kissed back, yeah.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Crown: …as a result of being scared.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Court:  What does
    common sense say? All right, I supposed I – that’s – that’s speculative. I
    suppose anything could happen. But she did kiss back…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The SCAJ’s primary reason for finding no error in the trial judge’s
    reasons was that although it was “arguable” that the trial judge relied on
    discredited rape myths in his analysis, “the trial judge did not articulate the
    assumptions, if any, he relied on.” The SCAJ noted that the trial judge “reviewed
    portions of the evidence but did not plainly relate them to the complainant’s
    credibility”. Respectfully, I disagree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Express identification by the trial judge of the impugned assumptions is
    unnecessary. The very problem with this type of reasoning is that it is
    insidious. It masquerades as “common sense”. It is evident from a review of the
    trial judge’s reasons that impermissible stereotypical sexual and myth-based reasoning
    was utilized in his assessment of the complainant’s credibility and reliability
    and underpinned his analysis of reasonable doubt. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nexus</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having established that the SCAJ committed legal error in his treatment
    of the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence, the Crown must also establish
    with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict would not necessarily
    have been the same if the legal error had not been made. In other words, the
    Crown must establish a nexus between the error of law and the resulting
    acquittal; that is, that the identified error “in the concrete reality of the
    case at hand … had a material bearing on the acquittal. The [Crown] is not
    required, however, to persuade [the court] that the verdict would necessarily
    have been different”: <em>R. v. Graveline</em>, 2006 SCC 16, [2006] 1 S.C.R.
    609, at para. 14. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent accepts that if the trial judge relied on stereotypical
    reasoning, that error would have inevitably affected his assessment of the
    evidence, including the respondent’s testimony. I agree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case turned on the trial judge’s assessment of the evidence of the
    complainant and the respondent. The trial judge set out the governing
    principles in his reasons. He recognized that it was his duty to assess the
    respondent’s evidence in light of all the evidence, including that of the
    complainant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s analysis of the complainant’s evidence in his oral
    reasons was tainted by his consideration of the outlined significant but
    non-determinative factors. Because the trial judge was required to consider the
    respondent’s evidence in light of all the evidence, including the
    complainant’s, it is not possible to divorce the trial judge’s acquittal of the
    respondent from his flawed reasoning. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The totality of the evidence of the events in issue emanated from only
    two people. The trial judge had to carefully, and without preconceived notions,
    consider the totality of the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge stated that he was troubled by some of the
    inconsistencies and contradictions in the respondent’s testimony. This is
    understandable as there were inconsistencies. Indeed, in closing submissions,
    the trial judge asked defence counsel whether he should prefer the evidence the
    respondent gave at trial or in his police statement. For instance, in his
    police statement, the respondent stated it was his idea to take his penis out,
    he asked the complainant to touch it, and she refused. At trial, the respondent
    testified that it was the complainant’s idea and request.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s assessment of the complainant’s credibility played a
    prominent role in determining both whether he would believe the respondent and
    whether he was left with a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The trial judge’s
    closing reference to <i>Nimchuk </i>reflects that he acquitted the respondent
    because he was unable to say what happened following his assessment of the
    conflicting testimony. However, his assessment of the entirety of the evidence
    was fatally flawed by the approach he took to the complainant’s evidence. The verdict
    would not necessarily have been the same in the absence of the trial judge’s
    legal errors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. A.B.A.</em>, 2019 ONCA 124, 145 O.R. (3d) 634, Justice
    Pardu stated at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Here I am satisfied that the verdict might have been different
    had the legal errors not occurred. The errors had a material bearing on the
    acquittals, that is to say, the errors may well have affected the outcome. I am
    not satisfied that the verdict necessarily would have been different but for
    the errors, but the Crown is not required to meet that more stringent test.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same must be said in this case. The SCAJ erred in concluding otherwise.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the acquittal, and
    order a new trial.</p>
