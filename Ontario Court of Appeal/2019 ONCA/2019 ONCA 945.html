  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge acquitted the respondent of
    sexual assault, sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching, and assault.
    The four charges against the respondent arose from allegations of sexual
    activity with his girlfriend’s daughter, who was between the ages of 11 and 14
    years old at the time of the alleged offences. The Crown appeals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a voluntary statement to the police, the
    respondent admitted to one instance of oral sex and one instance of
    penetration. He testified at trial and denied the allegations. The trial judge
    did not believe him and agreed with the trial Crown’s characterization of
    specific pages within the police statement as a “confession” to “a sexual
    crime” upon the complainant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that the trial judge failed to
    give effect to his own findings and seeks a conviction on two of the counts
    (sexual assault and sexual interference) or a new trial on all counts. The
    respondent submits that the trial judge had a reasonable doubt with respect to all
    counts and the appeal should be dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, the trial judge engaged in
    faulty reasoning, which led to errors of law. Specifically, the trial judge
    failed to make necessary findings of fact and failed to reconcile the evidence with
    his conclusion. Consequently, his reasons are insufficient to permit appellate
    review. They are also insufficient to substitute a conviction on any of the
    counts. On this basis, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. </span></p>

    she was in grade two. Three years later, she returned to live with her mother,
    who began dating the respondent the following year. Within a short time
    thereafter, the complainant’s mother invited the respondent to move in with her.
    He was in his late forties at the time. Approximately two and a half years
    later, the complainant disclosed several incidents of sexual abuse by the
    respondent that began when she was 11 years old. </span></p>

    a movie on the couch sitting next to each other under a blanket. He reached
    down her tank top and played with her breasts. He then pulled out his penis and
    pushed her head down to it so that she could perform oral sex. </span></p>
  <h2><strong><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span
lang=EN-CA>In the bunk bed </span></strong></h2>

lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>About one month after the movie night incident,
    while the complainant was lying on the top bunk of her bunk bed, the respondent
    started to play with her breasts and vagina. She tried to move away but he then
    put his penis in her mouth. </span></p>
  <h2><strong><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span

    beds. The complainant was lying on top of one of the beds. The respondent got
    on top of her, took her pants off, then had intercourse with her and ejaculated
    on her stomach. </span></p>

    and the respondent returned to the old house to retrieve items. The complainant
    was lying on a bed playing games on her phone. The respondent got on top of her
    and had vaginal intercourse with her from behind. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant initially recanted the
    allegations but later said it was because she was worried about being taken
    away from her mother, who did not believe her allegations and had said that the
    complainant would cause them financial problems. As it turns out, after she
    made her second statement to the police resulting in the respondent’s arrest, the
    complainant returned to foster care. </span></p>

    the complainant’s consent. On this issue, the trial judge said that the
    complainant’s evidence “stands alone”: at para.&nbsp; 2. In the present appeal,
    consent was not an issue. The complainant was incapable of giving consent
    because she was under the age of 16 when the alleged offences occurred, and the
    respondent was in a position of trust towards her. Here, the issue was the
    sexual contact between the respondent and a child, and the complainant’s
    evidence did not stand alone. It had to be considered in the context of all the
    evidence that the trial judge accepted, including the polygraph statement. </span></p>

    complainant was incapable of consent. The trial judge’s acceptance of portions

    with his rejection of the respondent’s denials at trial could have satisfied
    the elements of this offence. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Likewise, there was evidence to support the

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also appears to have misunderstood the trial Crown’s
    position as being based exclusively on the complainant’s testimony, which
    further compounded his error. Contrary to the trial judge’s view, at trial the </span>Crown <em><span lang=EN-CA>did </span></em>place significant reliance upon the polygraph
    statement in seeking convictions. In fact, the trial Crown closed her
    submissions by emphasizing the importance of the admissions contained in the
    statement:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>You have the transcript so I’ve
    just paused it there and my concluding remarks are in this inculpatory
    statement, January the 18th, that was voluntary and informed and  the result of
    two other police interviews and an interest in clearing his name and no reason
    to doubt the veracity of any of the things that he said and the details that he
    went over again and again, that what you’re hearing right here are the
    self-reflective, introspective remarks of a guilty man who’s acknowledging his
    guilt for the first time and coming to terms with it and I’m asking Your Honour
    to return verdicts of guilty on all counts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge clearly misunderstood these submissions. But even if he did not
    misunderstand, and the trial Crown did rest on the complainant’s evidence, the
    trial judge was still required to consider the evidence as a whole. </p>
  <h6>The complainant’s interest in sex</h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge erred in law by referring to the complainant’s “interest in
    sex” when considering her credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    of a complainant’s prior sexual activity is never admissible to support the
    twin myths that the complainant is less worthy of belief or more likely to have
    consented to the activity. Consent of a child is irrelevant and, in these
    circumstances, impossible at law. Yet, the trial judge considered this evidence
    in reference to her credibility. It appears in the section of the reasons
    dealing with the complainant’s credibility. Other underlined headings include
    “Lies” and “Motivated by Money”. </p>

    acquittal. Nor did he articulate the basis for his verdict. </span></p>

    suspicion as to [the respondent’s] guilt”: <em>Sheppard</em>, at para. 28; <em>R.E.M.</em>,
    at para. 53. The reasons are insufficient for appellate review. The reasons are
    not responsive to the central issues raised at trial. Although the trial judge’s

    “sufficiently articulate how credibility concerns were resolved”: <em>Dinardo</em>,
    at para. 26. This constitutes a reversible error.<em> </em>By failing to

    may “enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its
    opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law”: <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, s. 686(4)(b)(ii). As this court has explained, “In that event, the
    court is authorized to either sentence the accused directly or remit the matter
    back to the trial court for sentencing” (citations omitted): <em>Trachy</em>,
    at para. 86. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits the trial judge made all the
    findings necessary to convict the respondent of the first two counts. Having
    made the finding that the respondent confessed to a sexual crime and that he
    did not believe the respondent’s denials of the complainant’s allegations, the
    trial judge was bound to convict because the elements of the offences had been
    proven. Therefore, the Crown submits that this court should enter convictions
    on counts one and two.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are two impediments to the Crown’s request
    for a conviction: (i) the trial judge never made the required findings of fact;
    and, (ii) he never reconciled the conflicting evidence.</span></p>
  <h6><span lang=EN-CA>Failure to make findings of fact</span></h6>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Likewise, the trial judge adopts the trial

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the trial judge uses the terms
    “admissions” and “inculpatory statement” but fails to make a finding as to
    whether he accepts any portion as the truth. The trial judge’s use of familiar
    labels used to describe the kinds of evidence presented by the Crown –
    “admissions” and “inculpatory statement” - cannot be substituted for factual
    findings. Nor does the fact that the trial judge rejected the respondent’s
    evidence lead directly to a conviction. In my view, the trial judge was
    required to make findings as to what evidence – all, some, or none – he accepted
    as true. </span></p>

    findings, the trial judge also failed to explain why – in light of the polygraph
    statement and his rejection of the defence evidence – he had a reasonable
    doubt. In his reasons, he alludes to two opposite conclusions: the respondent
    committed a sexual crime on the complainant, and he had a reasonable doubt as
    to the respondent’s guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fact that the trial judge never reconciled
    these two conflicting conclusions is the reason that I would allow the appeal. This
    omission is also an impediment to entering a conviction for it is impossible to
    know what the result would have been but for these errors in law. <a
