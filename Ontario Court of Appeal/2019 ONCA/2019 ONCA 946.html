  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting the
    complainant, his cellmate, at the Ottawa Carleton Regional Detention Centre, by
    forcing him to engage in oral sex on three occasions on November 5, 2015. The
    appellant was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment<span lang=EN-CA>, together
    with certain ancillary orders. He now appeals his conviction and sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Trial</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only live question at trial was consent, which turned on
    credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:200%'>The trial judge disbelieved the appellant
    and found that his evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt. She concluded
    that the appellant’s evidence “varies, changes or is imprecise and at times
    clearly contradicts itself, precisely on the issue of consent.” She also
    accepted the complainant’s evidence that he did not consent. She therefore
    concluded that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and
    found the appellant guilty of sexual assault.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Appeal from Conviction</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal from conviction, the appellant seeks to challenge the trial
    judge’s credibility assessments on several grounds. He argues that the trial
    judge applied uneven scrutiny, failed to articulate sufficiently how
    credibility concerns were resolved, and misapprehended the evidence relevant to
    credibility. In essence, the appellant invites this court to reevaluate the
    witnesses’ credibility based on the transcripts and to reach conclusions
    contrary to those of the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We decline to do so. Credibility assessments are the domain of the trial
    judge, who has the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses in the context
    of all the other evidence adduced at trial. A trial judge’s credibility
    assessments are therefore afforded substantial deference on appeal: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Aird</span></em>, 2013 ONCA 447, 307 O.A.C. 183, at para. 39.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge recognized that the main question at trial was
    credibility. She gave detailed and cogent reasons for rejecting the appellant’s
    evidence and accepting the complainant’s evidence on the issue of consent,
    reasons which amply permit meaningful appellate review. The trial judge also
    understood from the complainant’s own testimony that the complainant suffered
    from conditions affecting his attention span, mental development, and memory,
    and therefore carefully considered his evidence in that light. Far from
    applying uneven scrutiny to the evidence, the trial judge properly assessed the
    complainant’s credibility and evidence “by reference to criteria appropriate to
    [his] mental development, understanding and ability to communicate”: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. R.W.</span></em>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p.&nbsp;134. We see
    no basis for this court to intervene.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal from conviction is therefore dismissed.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Appeal from Sentence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge sentenced the appellant to four years’ imprisonment,
    less 267 days’ credit for pre-sentence custody (178 days credited at 1.5:1),
    resulting in 39 months to be served.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal his sentence on three grounds.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge’s decision involves a significantly
    higher sentence than prior cases for similar offences. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. Although the circumstances of each case are different, numerous
    offenders have been sentenced in the three- to five-year range for sexual
    assault involving forced oral sex in analogous circumstances: see, for example, <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. S.A.</span></em>, 2014 ONCA 266, affirming <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Ajimotokan</span></em>, 2013 ONSC 1961, at paras. 3-6, 39; <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Allen</span></em>, 2017 ONCJ 405, at paras. 5-11, 43-44; <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Allard</span></em>, 2011 BCSC 915, at paras. 4, 9, 24-25; <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Dyck</span></em>, [1986] B.C.J. No. 3278 (S.C.), at paras. 3,
    6; <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. W.N.C.</span></em>, [2005] B.C.J. No. 1389
    (C.A.), at paras. 2, 4, 19; and <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Nadeau</span></em>,
    2017 BCPC 158, at paras. 6-11, 24-28, 80.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant asserts that the trial judge inappropriately applied the step
    principle (which provides that a subsequent sentence for the same type of
    offence should generally be higher than the previous sentence), as the
    appellant was still awaiting sentence for an unrelated sexual assault on
    another person. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    we disagree. The trial judge concluded that the sentence imposed was fit “with
    or without the step principle” — she therefore did not rely on the step
    principle. The trial judge also noted that the appellant had recently been
    convicted of another sexual offence for which he was later sentenced to three years’
    imprisonment. Although the appellant did not know his sentence at the time he
    committed the sexual assault at issue in this appeal, the trial judge stated
    that “[o]ne would think that his detention ought to have triggered some sense
    of behavioural acknowledgement and nexus or a link between his status and his
    sexualized behaviour.” She thus properly treated this prior conviction as an
    aggravating factor. We see no basis to impugn this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    relying on <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Duncan</span></em>, 2016 ONCA 754, at
    para. 6, the appellant asserts that this court has held that “in the
    appropriate circumstances, particularly harsh presentence incarceration
    conditions can provide mitigation apart from and beyond the 1.5 credit referred
    to in s. 719(3.1)” of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em></i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-46, and that sentencing courts should consider “both the conditions of the
    presentence incarceration and the impact of those conditions on the accused.”
    The appellant asserts that he should have received enhanced credit here because
    he was in segregation for his entire pre-sentence custody. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    again, we disagree. The decision as to whether to award enhanced credit for
    harsh pre-sentence incarceration conditions is a highly discretionary
    determination to which considerable deference is owed: <em><span lang=EN-CA>R.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge exercised her discretion to reject the appellant’s claim for
    enhanced credit because: (1) the appellant was placed in segregation as a result
    of his own behaviour in sexually assaulting his cellmate; (2) she concluded
    that the appellant’s “evidence about his time in segregation, the conditions
    and how it impacted him to be exaggerated”, and he had “declined each and every
    offer of yard time and fresh air”; and (3) most importantly, the appellant had
    refused several alternatives to segregation that were offered to him. We see no
    basis to intervene with these reasons for refusing enhanced credit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the final analysis, we see no error in principle, failure to consider a
    relevant sentencing factor, or erroneous consideration of an aggravating or
    mitigating factor that might justify appellate intervention: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Lacasse</span></em>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at
    para. 44. The sentence imposed was not demonstrably unfit, but rather properly
    reflected the principle of proportionality, namely, that <span lang=EN>a <span
class=solexhl>sentence</span> must be proportionate to the gravity of the
    offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Disposition</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but
    the appeal from sentence is dismissed, except that the victim surcharge imposed
    at trial is set aside.</p>
