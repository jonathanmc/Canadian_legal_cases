    approach to and assessment of the sufficiency of the appellants’ assets. On
    behalf of the moving parties, counsel argued forcefully that the motion judge
    erred because he limited his consideration to whether the appellants would have
    sufficient assets to pay the costs of the appeal, rather than the costs of the
    appeal <u>and the action</u>. She also argued that the motion judge made a
    number of other errors in assessing the sufficiency of the appellants’ assets. </span></p>

    reasons for dismissing the motion, I will consider each of the moving parties’ arguments
    in turn. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge acknowledged that the moving
    parties were seeking security for costs of both the appeal and the action: at
    para. 3. He considered the motion under the three subrules referred to by the
    moving parties: r. 61.06(1)(a), (b) and (c), as well as s. 12 of the <em>Libel
    and Slander Act</em>. He noted that the principal arguments were that there is
    good reason to believe the appeal is frivolous and vexatious and that the
    appellants have insufficient assets to pay the costs of the appeal and the
    trial: at para. 5.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge concluded that the appeal is
    neither frivolous nor vexatious under r. 61.06(1)(a) of the <em>Rules</em> (a
    finding that was not challenged in this panel review). While this would be
    determinative of the motion under r.&nbsp;61.06(1)(a), because the requirements
    are conjunctive, the motion judge went on to consider the second requirement of
    the subrule, whether there was good reason to believe that the appellants had
    insufficient assets to pay the costs of the appeal. The determination of
    whether there was good reason to believe that the corporate appellant had
    insufficient assets was in any event relevant to r.&nbsp;61.06(1)(b), in
    conjunction with r. 56.01(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In considering whether there was good reason to
    believe that the appellants had insufficient assets, the motion judge first
    determined that a reasonable estimate of the partial indemnity costs of the
    appeal would be $30,000. He then considered the evidence consisting of an
    affidavit of Mr. Melekhovets, who is the individual appellant and a principal
    of the corporate appellant, detailing his personal income, assets and
    liabilities, and those of the corporate appellant. The affidavit attached
    copies of various documents, including mortgage statements, notices of
    assessment, bank records, and unaudited financial statements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge accepted that Mr. Melekhovets
    has net equity in real property and assets in Ontario of slightly more than
    $500,000. For the corporate appellant, the motion judge considered unaudited
    financial statements covering the financial years 2015 through 2018, and he noted
    the increase in the company’s annual revenue from $670,000 to just over $1
    million and in its retained earnings from $18,274 to $136,386. He also noted
    that the net earnings during that period were modest but rising, except for the
    year ended January 31, 2018 when the company experienced a small net loss. The
    motion judge concluded that there was good reason to believe that the
    appellants had sufficient assets in Ontario to pay the estimated costs of
    appeal of $30,000: at para. 29.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge then relied on his conclusions (that
    there was no good reason to believe the appeal was frivolous and vexatious nor
    that the appellants would have insufficient assets to pay costs of the appeal)
    to dismiss the motion for security for costs under rr. 61.06(1)(b) and (c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the motion judge considered the moving
    parties’ alternative request to lift the stay of execution on their costs award
    pursuant to r. 63.01(5). He observed that the moving parties had not
    established that they would suffer financial hardship if the stay were not lifted,
    which is a necessary precondition to lifting the stay. The motion judge also concluded
    that, while security for costs of the proceeding can be ordered under r. 61.06,
    the moving party must first have met the conditions set out in r. 61.06 and
    demonstrated that the justice of the case supported ordering security for
    costs. In this case, since the test was not met, to lift the stay would permit
    the moving parties to do indirectly what they could not do directly: at para.
    42.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>determining the sufficiency of assets</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On this review motion, the moving parties assert
    that the motion judge erred by not considering whether the appellants would
    have sufficient assets to pay trial costs as well as appeal costs, if
    unsuccessful in the appeal. They point to the wording of r. 61.06(1), which
    permits the court to award security for costs of the appeal and of the
    proceedings, as well as the decision in <em>Aegis Biomedical Technologies Ltd.
    v. Jackowski </em>(1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 558 (C.A.), in which this court awarded
    security for costs that included the costs awarded in the court below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The moving parties also point to r. 61.06(1)(b),
    which provides for the appeal court to order security for costs where it
    appears that an order for security for costs could be made against the appellant
    under r. 56.01. Rule 56.01 lists six circumstances in which an order for
    security for costs may be made in an action or application, including that “(d)
    the plaintiff or applicant is a corporation… and there is good reason to
    believe that the plaintiff or applicant has insufficient assets in Ontario to
    pay the costs of the defendant or respondent”. The moving parties observe that this
    provision requires the court, in considering a motion for security for costs of
    an appeal under r. 61.06(1)(b), to consider whether the corporate appellant has
    insufficient assets in Ontario to pay “the costs of the defendant”. The moving
    parties say that “the costs of the defendant” can only be a reference to the
    costs they were awarded at trial, and that therefore the court in determining
    security for costs of an appeal <u>must</u> consider the corporate appellant’s
    ability to pay the costs ordered in the court below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I disagree. While the reference in r.
    61.06(1)(b) to r. 56.01 authorizes the appeal court to consider the same
    factors that would be considered to warrant security for costs of an action or
    application, in doing so, the factors set out in r.&nbsp;56.01 must be read and
    applied in the context of the pending appeal. To give effect to r. 56.01 in the
    context of an appeal, the reference to the “plaintiff” or “applicant” can only
    mean the “appellant”. So, for example, under r. 56.01(1)(a), the question is
    whether at the time of the appeal, the <u>appellant</u> is ordinarily resident
    outside Ontario. Similarly, the reference in r. 56.01(1)(d) to “the costs of
    the defendant or respondent” must be read as “the costs of the respondent in
    the appeal”. What this means is that, in the case of a corporate appellant that
    was a plaintiff or applicant at first instance, a judge of this court may
    consider ordering security for costs where there is good reason to believe that
    the corporate appellant has insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the costs of
    the appeal, even where the appeal is not frivolous and vexatious.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I say this despite the fact that the court,
    under r. 61.06(1), is entitled to award security for costs of an appeal <u>and
    of the proceeding below</u>. Indeed, under r.&nbsp;61.06(1)(a), the test in
    respect of sufficiency of assets is tied only to the appellant’s ability to pay
    costs of the appeal. The decision in <em>Aegis Biomedical</em> did not<i> </i>involve
    an assessment of the sufficiency of the corporate appellant’s ability to pay
    costs in the court below. Indeed, in that case the sole appellant was a
    corporation that admitted it had no assets, and had been incorporated for the
    purpose of pursuing the litigation: at p. 560.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This interpretation of the relationship between rr.
    61.06(1)(b) and 56.01(1)(d) mirrors the logic of r. 61.06(1)(a), where a motion
    judge only considers the appellant’s ability to pay costs of the appeal, and
    yet may order the costs of both the appeal and the proceeding below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even if the moving parties’ interpretation of r.&nbsp;61.06(1)(b)
    and r. 56.01(1)(d) were accepted, or if there were some other reason to consider
    the sufficiency of the corporate appellant’s assets to satisfy the costs order
    in the court below, the overriding consideration is whether an order for
    security for costs would be just, a question that needs to be considered
    holistically, taking into consideration the circumstances of the particular
    case: <em>Yaiguaje</em>, at para. 25. See also <em>Foodinvest Inc. v. Royal
    Bank of Canada</em>, 2019 ONCA 728, at para. 8.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this regard, the appeal is not frivolous and
    vexatious. The appellants appeal the judgment in the court below, and seek
    leave to appeal the costs order. As the motion judge observed in refusing
    security for costs under r. 61.06(1)(c), the corporate appellant is a going
    concern in Ontario, and has been for many years. The individual appellant has
    disclosed the location and value of his residential realty in Ontario, and he
    has provided copies of notices of assessment for his personal tax returns. The appellants
    have paid all costs in the proceedings, save for the costs order in relation to
    the judgment under appeal. They have already posted $300,000 security for costs
    in the court below. An order for security for costs based on the insufficiency
    of the corporate appellant’s assets in relation to the costs already ordered,
    and that would include security for costs of the appeal and such costs, runs
    the risk of undermining the appellants’ right to appeal. In my view, in all of
    these circumstances, the order would not be just.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Next, the moving parties assert that the motion
    judge <u>shifted the burden of proof</u> by rejecting their submissions about
    the obvious and glaring deficiencies in the evidence respecting the sufficiency
    and quality of the appellants’ assets because they failed to cross-examine on
    that evidence. They say that the motion judge, at para. 26, refused to consider
    the deficiencies in the appellants’ evidence about their assets, which were
    already apparent on the face of the evidence, simply because the respondents
    did not cross-examine. I do not read the motion judge’s reasons that way.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge considered the record and
    concluded that the information that was provided demonstrated that the
    appellants had sufficient assets in Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal. He
    did not accept the moving parties’ submissions that the appellants obviously
    had insufficient assets or that their evidence was deficient. Many of the same
    arguments were made to this panel. The motion judge conducted his own
    assessment of the evidence, which is entitled to deference. He was entitled, as
    he did, to consider the failure to cross-examine in rejecting the moving
    parties’ assertion that the absence of certain additional information made the
    financial information that was provided incomplete or unreliable. Moreover, the
    financial information provided in this case was detailed, and contrary to the
    moving parties’ submissions, did not reveal “obvious and glaring deficiencies”.
    The motion judge reasonably concluded that the moving parties had not met their
    burden of showing that the appellants had insufficient assets in the
    jurisdiction to pay the appeal costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, in my view there was no error in the motion
    judge’s characterization of an order for security for costs as not “routine”:
    para. 8. While the court characterized orders for security for costs under r.
    61.06(1)(a) as not “routine” in <em>Schmidt v. Toronto Dominion Bank</em> (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.) at p. 5, I do not agree with the moving parties
    that an order for security for costs of an appeal would be “routine” under the
    other parts of r. 61.06(1). There is no entitlement as of right to an order for
    security for costs, and even where the requirements of the rule have been met,
    security may be refused in the motion judge’s discretion: <em>Yaiguaje</em>, at
    paras. 18 and 23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, on the question of sufficiency of
    assets, I do not accept that the motion judge relied on irrelevant facts or
    ignored relevant facts. The moving parties say that the motion judge accepted
    dated financial information (unaudited financial statements for the years 2015
    to 2018), rather than considering whether, at the time of the motion, the
    appellants had sufficient assets to pay costs. The moving parties assert that
    there was no evidence that the appellants’ financial circumstances remained the
    same. This argument simply invites this court to conduct a <em>de novo</em> assessment of the evidence, and to arrive at a different conclusion. The motion
    judge noted that the financial statements that were provided were all of the
    available financial statements (as the appellants explained, financial
    statements for the period ending January 30, 2019 had not yet been prepared).
    Again, in the absence of cross-examination, the motion judge was entitled to
    accept the reasonable inference that these documents provided a fair
    representation of the corporate appellant’s financial circumstances at the time
    of the motion.</span></p>

    provide an automatic right to obtain in this court security for costs of a

    there was no “other good reason” to order security for costs of the appeal in
    this case. His reasons for refusing security under r. 61.06(1)(c) are
    summarized above at para. 19. While the list of reasons justifying security
    under r. 61.06(1)(c) is open-ended, the “other good reason” must be related to
    the purpose for ordering security: that the respondent is entitled to a measure
    of protection for costs. The “other good reason” should be fairly compelling,
    as resort is to this provision when the respondent has been unable to obtain
    security under the other two categories, and security for costs under r.
