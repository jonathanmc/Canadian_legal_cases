    technician at Quinte Healthcare Corporation (“QHC”). She was a member of the
    Ontario Public Service Employees Union (“OPSEU”), the exclusive bargaining
    agent on behalf of all employees in her bargaining unit. QHC and OPSEU were
    parties to a collective agreement governing the terms and conditions of
    employment of all unionized employees of QHC.</span></p>

    accident in August 2011. She claimed that she was disabled as a result of her
    injuries and sought long-term disability benefits under the terms of the
    collective agreement. As explained in more detail below, she received benefits
    for about 17 months before Manulife determined that she was no longer eligible
    for LTD benefits. After Manulife denied her benefits, she filed a formal grievance
    against her employer. The grievance settled in September 2015. Prior to the
    settlement, however, the appellant commenced this action against Manulife.</span></p>

    QHC pays 75% of the premiums and the employee pays the balance. Any disputes are
    to be resolved by grievance and arbitration (Art. 15.04(a)). It also provides
    for resort to the insurance company’s appeal process prior to filing a
    grievance (Art. 15.04(b)). The material provisions are:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January 2012, the appellant applied to
    Manulife for LTD benefits. Her claim was initially approved, and she received
    benefits from March 19, 2012 to August 22, 2013. However, after a review of her
    file by Manulife in 2013, she was advised that her condition no longer met the
    definition of “total disability” under the Manulife policy. The definition
    stipulated that an employee would be entitled to LTD benefits where their
    injury or illness prevented them from performing the essential duties of their
    “own occupation” during the two years immediately following the date of
    disability, and “any occupation” they were qualified for or could reasonably
    become qualified for after two years. At the two-year mark, the appellant’s
    disability was determined not to prevent her from performing the essential
    duties of “any occupation”. She was therefore no longer eligible to receive LTD
    benefits.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On December 17, 2013, the appellant filed a
    grievance with QHC, following the grievance procedure set out in the collective
    agreement. Her grievance stated: “I grieve that the Employer has violated
    Article 15 of the collective agreement by denying my claim for long term
    disability benefits.” Her desired settlement was “[f]ull redress, including
    approval for LTD benefits as well as anything else an arbitrator deems
    appropriate.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 2, 2014, OPSEU requested that
    Manulife reconsider its decision to terminate the appellant’s LTD benefits.
    Manulife agreed, despite the fact that the deadline for appeal had passed. However,
    on November 10, 2014, Manulife advised the appellant that the termination of
    benefits was upheld and that its decision was final.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Almost a year later, on August 19, 2015, with
    her grievance still outstanding, the appellant commenced this action against
    Manulife. She claimed, among other things, breach of contract, entitlement to LTD
    benefits, and punitive damages of $500,000 for “bad faith”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A few weeks later, on September 1, 2015, the day
    her grievance was scheduled to be heard, the appellant settled her grievance
    with QHC and OPSEU. The settlement provided, among other things, for $30,000
    for general damages and not for loss of income, and $31,800 less statutory
    deductions, allocated over three years. The motion judge found that the $31,800
    was for “loss of income”. The terms of the settlement did not prevent the
    appellant from pursuing her claim against Manulife. In September 2017, she also
    commenced an action against her union, OPSEU, and the two OPSEU lawyers who
    represented her in the grievance and settlement, claiming damages for
    negligence in the amount of $1,500,000.</span></p>

    dismiss the appellant’s action on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction
    over the claim, as it arose out of the collective agreement between QHC and

    collective agreement.</span></p>

    set out in <em>Weber v. Ontario Hydro</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, requires the
    court to determine “whether the dispute, in its essential character, arises
    from the interpretation, application, administration or violation of the

    specific Manulife policy contracted by QHC is not referenced in the collective
    agreement because, as the central collective agreement notes, local employers
    may change the insurance carrier at any time. It is also noted in the OPSEU

    not incorporate the plan into the agreement or make specific reference to it”. He

    erred in finding that QHC was contractually liable to pay the LTD benefits. She
    claims this was an error because, not only was there no evidence that QHC was
    responsible for payment of benefits, its only contractual obligation under
    Article 15 was to provide an LTD plan equivalent to HOODIP and to pay a portion
    of the premium. In contrast, there was evidence that Manulife was responsible
    for the administration of the policy and the payment of claims. This misapprehension
    led the motion judge to incorrectly categorize the claim as falling within <em>Brown
    and Beatty</em> category 2, rather than category 3. Category 3 was more
    appropriate because the collective agreement only obliged the employer to
    procure the policy and pay a portion of the premium. Further, as the collective
    agreement did not provide any details of the Manulife benefit plan, it cannot
    reasonably be held that QHC agreed to pay those benefits itself.</span></p>

    entitlement dispute to be arbitrable under the terms of the collective
    agreement, it must arise under HOODIP or an equivalent plan. However, in this
    case, as HOODIP and the Manulife policy have different definitions of “total
    disability”, they cannot be considered to be equivalent plans. Thus, while a
    claim as to whether QHC failed to provide the benefits promised under HOODIP
    would be arbitrable, her claim about whether she meets the definition of “total
    disability” under the Manulife policy is inarbitrable because it arises under
    the terms of the policy, not the collective agreement. The Manulife policy is
    distinct from the collective agreement, and disputes arising from it should be

  <p class=CQuote>To determine whether a dispute arises out of the collective

    and the ambit of the collective agreement. In considering the nature of the
    dispute, the goal is to determine its essential character. This determination
    must proceed on the basis of the facts surrounding the dispute between the
    parties, and not on the basis of how the legal issues may be framed. Simply,
    the decision-maker must determine whether, having examined the factual context
    of the dispute, its essential character concerns a subject matter that is
    covered by the collective agreement. Upon determining the essential character
    of the dispute, the decision-maker must examine the provisions of the
    collective agreement to determine whether it contemplates such factual
    situations. It is clear that the collective agreement need not provide for the
    subject matter of the dispute explicitly. If the essential character of the
    dispute arises either explicitly, or implicitly, from the interpretation,
    application, administration or violation of the collective agreement, the
    dispute is within the sole jurisdiction of an arbitrator to decide. [Internal

    “can be characterized as constituting or forming part of a collective
    agreement” so as to be enforceable by arbitration. This is primarily a question
    of interpretation of the collective agreement. As <em>Brown and Beatty</em> acknowledge,

    conclusions regarding the interpretation of a collective agreement, they must
    not distract from the primary exercise at hand: determining whether the essential

    The cost of all benefits, other than LTD benefits, were to be paid for by the

    disputes under HOODIP and not for disputes under an equivalent plan. The arbitrators
    rejected the submission, in language I find persuasive, at paras. 12 and 13:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In our view, having reviewed both the disputed provisions and
    the article as a whole, the only interpretation which makes sense is one in
    which the words &quot;or an equivalent plan&quot; is read into Article 12.07.
    Indeed, if these words were not read into Article 12.07 then the plan could not
    be equivalent - something which the employer is obligated to provide - for
    there would be no collective agreement mechanism for the adjudication of
    disputes dealing with coverage. The language, of course, is central and it is
    the well-known intention of the parties that coverage be uniform. Our
    conclusion about the proper interpretation of the provision is independently
    arrived at following a review of the provision. However, it is also a
    conclusion in complete compliance with existing authority.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In that respect, we are in agreement with Arbitrator Thorne's
    decision, and reasons for decision, in <em>Trenton</em>, a finding recently
    upheld by the Divisional Court. As Arbitrator Thorne found, there was no need,
    in Article 12.07 to specifically refer to &quot;an equivalent plan&quot; for
    the provision, read as a whole clearly incorporates any equivalent plan. While
    employer counsel takes the position that the issue is still alive - the
    Divisional Court having dismissed the application purely on the basis of its
    finding that the decision was not patently unreasonable - we read the Court's
    endorsement somewhat more broadly. The Court, significantly in our view,
    concluded: &quot;To give the collective agreement the meaning suggested by the
    applicant would be to ignore the provision of article 12.07.&quot; We reach the

    by some labour arbitrators as “strange”, “startling”, “unusual” or “unique.”  She
    noted that there was no provision in the collective agreement providing for
    arbitration of disputes regarding other benefits provided in the group
    insurance policy, including life insurance and accidental death and
    dismemberment benefits.</span></p>

    provisions of the collective agreement are “strange” and “unique”, because the
    employer has contractually bound itself to provide employees with the coverage
    described in HOODIP and to resolve coverage disputes by arbitration, even
    though the LTD coverage itself is provided by a third party. Were it necessary
    to do so, I would characterize this case as falling within <em>Brown and Beatty</em> category 4: the employer bound itself to provide the short-term and long-term
    disability coverage set out in HOODIP, which was incorporated into the
    collective agreement. While Manulife’s policy provided the administrative and
    financial backstops to that coverage, the employee’s recourse was to the
    employer, under the collective agreement.</span></p>

    may be described as “strange” and “unique”, I can well understand why OPSEU may
    have negotiated terms such as these on behalf of hospital employees. It permits
    disabled employees to resolve their LTD disputes by grievance and arbitration
    with their employer, rather than by litigation against the insurer. The
    arbitration process is faster, more cost effective, and engages the experience
    of expert arbitrators.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, while the appellant phrases her
    claim as a disagreement over whether she meets the definition of “total
    disability” under the Manulife plan, the true substance of her dispute is a
    disagreement with her employer over her entitlement to LTD benefits as outlined
    in the collective agreement. This clearly arises from the collective agreement
    and falls within the purview of an arbitrator to decide. Here, the dispute was
    resolved through the appeals and grievance process stipulated in the agreement.
    The appellant has no entitlement to resort to the court for additional
    compensation from the insurer.</span></p>
