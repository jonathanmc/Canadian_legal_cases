  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the order of Justice James Ramsay of the
    Superior Court of Justice, dated April 8, 2019, and from the costs order, dated
    April 25, 2019, with reasons reported at 2019 ONSC 2601.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Rouleau and Huscroft JJ.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span
style='line-height:200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from the orders of the trial judge varying the terms
    of a previous custody and access order, and awarding costs to the respondent.
    The trial judge ordered that the children’s primary residence remain in the
    Niagara region with the respondent and gave him final decision-making
    responsibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unusually, this appeal concerns not only the trial judge’s ultimate
    decision, but also his decision to hear and decide the case at all. That is so
    because during the course of the trial, the parties negotiated Minutes of Settlement
    (the “proposed settlement”) which, if accepted by the court, would have resolved
    their dispute. The proposed settlement provided that the children would move
    from their home in the Niagara region to live primarily with the appellant in
    Ottawa. The agreement that the children move to Ottawa was, however, subject to
    a number of conditions, including that the respondent would be responsible for
    making final decisions concerning the children. Had the trial judge accepted the
    proposed settlement, there would have been no need to complete the trial, and
    no trial decision to appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the trial judge refused to accept the parties’ proposed settlement
    and gave no reasons for doing so. The parties went on to complete the trial,
    and the trial judge found that it was in the best interests of the children for
    their primary residence to remain with the respondent in the Niagara region,
    and varied the terms of the order in his favour accordingly.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals, arguing that the trial judge’s refusal to accept
    the parties’ proposed settlement was contrary to the best interests of the
    children, the principles of fundamental justice, and is indicative of bias. She
    also appeals from the trial judge’s decision to award costs to the respondent
    in the amount of $40,000.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude that the trial judge had the authority to reject the proposed
    settlement if he found that it was not in the best interests of the children.
    Although he erred in failing to provide reasons for his decision to reject the
    proposed settlement, there is no basis for this court to interfere with the
    decision the trial judge reached following trial. The findings he made confirm
    that the custody and access order he made was in the best interests of the
    children. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal, other than to vary the costs
    order.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span
style='line-height:200%'>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sylvia Richardson (the appellant) and Mark Richardson (the respondent)
    were married on August 3, 2003. They separated in 2012 and divorced in 2015.
    Both parties have since remarried. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They have two children: a daughter (currently 14 years old) and a son
    (currently 8 years old). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2015, the parties consented to participate in an assessment pursuant
    to s. 30 of the <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Children’s Law Reform Act</span></em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12. The appellant was seeking to have the children move with
    her to Ottawa, where she planned to relocate. The assessor, however, agreed
    with the respondent and recommended that the children stay in the Niagara region
    and that the parties have joint custody. The parties accepted this
    recommendation and settled the matter. The settlement was accepted by Carpenter-Gunn
    J., and a consent order dated June 14, 2016 was issued on these terms.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2016, both parties had residences in the Niagara region. However, the
    appellant was then dividing her time between the Niagara region and the Ottawa
    area, where she maintained a residence with her new spouse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In July 2017, the appellant was appointed as a Justice of the Peace in
    the Ottawa region, moved to Ottawa as planned, and sold her Niagara residence.
    She brought a motion to change the consent order on the basis that it would be
    in the children's best interests to reside primarily with her in Ottawa. The
    parties could not settle the matter and it proceeded to trial on April 1, 2019.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span
style='line-height:200%'>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>THE REJECTION OF THE PROPOSED
    SETTLEMENT </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the second day of the trial, the parties' counsel advised the trial
    judge that they were attempting to negotiate a settlement. The trial judge
    granted the parties an adjournment to negotiate, but informed them that the
    trial would have to proceed the following morning, regardless of whether
    negotiations were continuing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The following morning, April 3, 2019, counsel for the parties presented the
    proposed settlement to the trial judge. Among other things, the proposed settlement
    provided that the children would move from their home with the respondent in
    the Niagara region to Ottawa, where they would live with the appellant.
    However, the proposed settlement also provided that the respondent would have
    final decision-making authority concerning the children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge reviewed the proposed settlement but refused to approve it.
    The following exchange occurred:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT: Thank you for giving me a copy of the minutes of settlement.
    I have read them. I do not accept them. You may call your next witness. I'm not
    prepared to sign off on it so let's carry on. And I can't really say why. I
    just have to hear all the evidence. Do you want a few minutes?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[Counsel]: Yes, sir.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>THE COURT: Yeah. I'll be back in
    10 minutes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel did not seek any clarification and raised no objection to the
    trial judge’s decision to reject the proposed settlement and continue with the
    trial. The trial resumed following a short break and continued to its
    conclusion the next day. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge released his decision on April 8, 2019, denying the
    appellant’s requested change and largely accepting the respondent’s proposal.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span
style='line-height:200%'>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S DECISION ON THE
    MERITS </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the growth of the children did not constitute
    a change of circumstance that was unforeseen when the original custody and
    access order was made. Although the daughter’s expressed wish to attend high
    school in Ottawa could constitute a change in circumstances, the trial judge
    found that the appellant failed to meet her burden to establish that it did,
    noting that the daughter had expressed different wishes at various times over
    the years.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the respondent was essentially credible but
    expressed concerns about the appellant’s credibility and motivations. He
    considered it unreasonable of her to think that the children could share
    residence between parents who lived so far apart, and found that she had made
    demands the respondent could not possibly meet. The trial judge described the
    appellant’s attempt to justify some of her actions as “baffling” and stated
    that her “strong desire to win seems to have clouded her judgment”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge detailed several incidents that concerned him. He was
    particularly concerned with the appellant’s decision to ask the police to carry
    out a welfare check when the children were with the respondent and her
    involvement of the Children’s Aid Society without having any legitimate basis
    for doing so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most important finding made by the trial judge concerned the
    daughter and her expressed wish to move to Ottawa. The trial judge found that
    this wish arose primarily out of the parental conflict rather than from
    independent considerations. He found, further, that her real wish was to end
    the conflict between her parents, and that she understood – correctly in the
    trial judge’s view – that the appellant was the source of the conflict. As a
    result, the trial judge concluded that the appellant had not established that
    there had been a change in circumstances and dismissed her motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then considered the respondent’s request for changes to
    the schedule established in the 2016 order. He found that the respondent had
    established a change in circumstances: the appellant’s move had made equal
    sharing impractical; the children had undergone too many tiring trips; and they
    had missed too much school. The trial judge described the respondent as
    “essentially under siege”, which had weakened his ability to fulfil the needs
    of the children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge conducted a fresh inquiry into the best interests of the
    children, concluding that their principal residence in the Niagara region
    should not change. The children had lived in the Niagara region since birth;
    they were physically and emotionally close to their paternal relatives, who also
    reside in the region; they were well established at school and with friends;
    and they were doing well academically. The trial judge found that school had
    become the daughter’s refuge from family conflict and that it would be a bad
    time to uproot her. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the trial judge concluded that a move to Ottawa was not in
    the best interests of the children, but that a change to the access schedule
    was. He adopted more or less the respondent’s draft proposal. The children
    would remain in the Niagara region. Their primary residence would be with the
    respondent. However, the trial judge made several amendments to the
    respondent’s draft proposal, namely in the provision for time sharing so as to reduce
    travel. This had the effect of reducing the appellant’s access to the children.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge awarded the respondent costs in the amount of $40,000,
    which he characterized as “an amount that would have reasonably been
    contemplated for almost full indemnity.”</p>
  <p class=Heading><span
style='line-height:200%'>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>DISCUSSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thrust of the appellant’s argument concerns the trial judge’s
    rejection of the proposed settlement. The appellant says that the trial judge
    erred in rejecting the proposed settlement, in failing to give reasons for
    rejecting the proposed settlement, and in hearing the trial rather than
    recusing himself after having rejected the proposed settlement. As a result of
    these errors, she submits, the trial judge’s decision cannot stand. In response
    to a question from the bench, the appellant confirmed that she would not
    directly address the merits of the trial judge’s reasons for the order he made.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute about the importance of settlements in family law. Settlements
    are to be promoted and encouraged, as our colleague Nordheimer J.A. explains.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it is well established that judges have the authority to
    review settlements and to reject them if they are not in the best interests of
    the children: <em>Martin v. Martin</em>, 1981 CarswellBC 773 (C.A.), at para. 7; <em>C.T.G. v. R.R.G.</em>, 2016 SKQB 387, 86 R.F.L. (7th) 312, at para. 11; and <em>Harper v. Harper</em> (1991), 78 D.L.R. (4th) 548 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at p.
    553. This authority must be exercised with caution. Mere disagreement with the
    terms of a settlement affords no basis for courts to intervene: see e.g., <em>F.J.V.
    v. W.K.S.</em>, 2019 BCCA 67, 18 R.F.L. (8th) 255, at paras. 26, 29. Further,
    whether a settlement is in the children’s best interests should take into
    account more than just the settlement terms. It should also consider the
    general benefits to children that flow from parents resolving their disputes through
    compromise rather than litigation.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a judge rejects a settlement, the reasons for rejecting the
    settlement should be provided. Moreover, if the judge does not take any steps
    to facilitate settlement – such as sending the parties away with some direction
    as to the aspects of the agreement that are of concern, or arranging a
    settlement conference either with him or her or with another judge – the reason
    for this should also be provided. Without explaining the basis upon which the
    parties’ settlement is rejected, the judge leaves the parties with no way of
    knowing, what, if anything, they could do to address the court’s concerns. The
    concerns may have been of a nature that could be addressed, but in the absence
    of reasons the parties will have no opportunity to address them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This said, the situation in this case is exceptional. The proposed settlement
    was reached and rejected in the midst of a short four-day trial. In such
    circumstances, reasons need to be carefully crafted, and could be very brief.
    This is to avoid the appearance that the judge prejudged the case, which would
    preclude the judge from continuing to hear the case. Depending on the judge’s
    concerns, the reasons may do little more than advise the parties that, at that
    stage of the proceeding, and without hearing the balance of the trial, he or
    she is not prepared to find that the settlement is in the best interests of the
    children. More complete reasons could then be provided at the end of the trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the trial judge’s decision to continue the trial without
    providing reasons for rejecting the proposed settlement undermined the
    settlement process and the court’s duty to help the parties settle their case: <em>Family
    Law Rules</em>, O. Reg. 114/99, r. 2(5)(c). But in our view, the findings of
    the trial judge, which were made after a full hearing on the merits and are not
    contested on appeal, make clear that sound bases exist for rejecting the proposed
    settlement.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also argues that the trial judge acted contrary to <em>Charter</em> values in rejecting the proposed settlement and that the rejection of the proposed
    settlement constitutes an infringement of the parties’ liberty that engaged s.
    7 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. In our view, these
    submissions are fundamentally misconceived and without merit. As Miller J.A. recently
    explained in <em><span style='line-height:200%'>McKitty v. Hayani</span></em><em>, </em>2019 ONCA 805, <em><span style='line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em> values and <em>Charter</em> rights are distinct juridical concepts that are subject
    to different rules governing their use in different contexts. The analysis
    required in this case depends on the best interests of the children, not <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em> values or <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Charter</span></em> rights. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conclude on this point, we agree with the appellant that the trial
    judge should have provided reasons for his decision to reject the proposed
    settlement. However, it does not follow that the proposed settlement should now
    be accepted. What, if anything, flows from the trial judge’s error must be
    considered in light of the fact that the trial continued to completion and the
    trial judge made findings as to the best interests of the children. We turn now
    to that issue. </p>

    merits </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge’s error in rejecting the proposed
    settlement without reasons provides a basis for setting aside his trial
    decision on the merits. She contends, further, that having been privy to the proposed
    settlement, the trial judge was disqualified from hearing the case. Finally,
    she maintains that the rejection of the proposed settlement and her previous
    dealings with the trial judge created a reasonable apprehension of bias. In her
    view, this tainted the whole trial process that followed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we will explain, these arguments must be rejected. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was not disqualified from continuing with the trial
    after he rejected the proposed settlement</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point in the analysis is r. 17(24) of the <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Family Law Rules</span></em>, which provides that “A judge
    who conducts a settlement conference about an issue shall not hear the issue”.
    The only stated exception concerns child protection cases: r. 17(25). Moreover,
    settlement confidentiality is required by the rules. None of the material
    prepared for the settlement conference, the briefs, nor any statement made
    during the conference may be disclosed to any other judge, except where the
    statement or information is contained in an agreement that emanates from the
    conference or an order made thereafter: r. 17(23). See also r. 17(22), which
    specifies that case conference briefs do not form part of the continuing record
    and shall be returned to the parties or destroyed after the conference.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge did not conduct a settlement conference,
    and as a result r. 17(24) does not apply. Nor does r. 17(22) apply, as he was
    not privy to any case conference briefs. Accordingly, nothing in the <em>Family
    Law Rules</em> precluded the trial judge from hearing the matter. Nor did his
    knowledge of the proposed settlement require him to recuse himself of his own
    motion.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the parties at trial must be taken to have come to the same
    conclusion. Both parties were represented by counsel, and neither party objected
    to the trial judge proceeding with the trial after he rejected the proposed settlement. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is no small matter. Counsel had several options once the trial
    judge rejected the proposed settlement. They could have sought an adjournment.
    They could have asked for reasons for his rejection of the proposed settlement.
    They could have asked the trial judge to recuse himself. Either party could
    have advised the trial judge that they wished to appeal the rejection and asked
    the trial judge to adjourn until after the appeal: see e.g., <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>F.J.V. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They did none of these things.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The only conclusion possible in these circumstances is that counsel for
    both parties were content to proceed to trial, or at least willing to acquiesce
    in the trial judge’s decision to do so, after he rejected the proposed
    settlement. The trial judge’s decision to continue to hear the trial cannot now
    be impugned.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s “ineffective assistance of counsel” allegation does not
    assist her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although ineffective assistance of counsel can be argued as a ground of
    appeal in civil as well as criminal cases, it is granted more rarely in civil
    contexts than criminal. Stratas J.A. canvasses the relevant considerations in <em>Mediatube
    Corp. v. Bell Canada</em>, 2018 FCA 127, 156 C.P.R. (4th) 289, at paras. 27-44. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ineffective assistance of counsel argument was not pressed seriously
    in this case, nor could it be. Putting aside concerns about the adequacy and
    fairness of the procedure followed in raising this complaint, neither component
    of the test can be established on the facts of this case. There is no evidence
    that the alleged incompetent representation caused a miscarriage of justice –
    that the appellant was prejudiced as a result of the representation she
    received: see <em>Children’s Aid Society of the Regional Municipality of
    Waterloo v. C.T.</em>, 2017 ONCA 931, [2018] 4 C.N.L.R. 31, at para. 96, leave
    to appeal refused, [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 51. Nor is there any evidence that
    counsel provided incompetent representation – that counsel’s actions were
    unreasonable in the circumstances as they existed at that time: <em>R. v.
    Archer </em>(2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60<em> </em>(Ont. C.A.), at para. 119. In
    fact, there is no evidence as to the advice provided by counsel or the instructions
    given to counsel by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, we see no basis for concluding that the trial judge’s
    review of the proposed settlement compromised his ability to determine the
    matter at trial. The trial judge is presumed to be impartial and that
    presumption has not been rebutted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regardless of what he learned from reading the proposed settlement, the
    trial judge was required to reach a decision following trial as to the best
    interests of the children. We are satisfied that he did so, and again we
    emphasize that his reasons for so concluding are not directly challenged by the
    appellant. If anyone’s position was potentially undermined by the trial judge’s
    knowledge of the proposed settlement, it was the respondent’s. The respondent’s
    trial evidence was that the children’s best interests were served by their
    continued residence in the Niagara region but the trial judge now knew that,
    for whatever reason, he had agreed to allow the children to move to Ottawa, as
    advocated by the appellant. Yet, following trial of the matter, the trial judge
    reached the conclusion that it was in the best interests of the children to
    remain with the respondent in the Niagara region, rather than move to Ottawa
    with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no reasonable apprehension of bias</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge’s rejection of the proposed
    settlement demonstrates that he prejudged the central issue of where the
    children should reside.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, the trial judge was required to review the proposed settlement
    and to reject it if he concluded that it was not in the best interests of the
    children. His error lies in failing to provide reasons for rejecting the proposed
    settlement, but that error does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of
    bias. It cannot be concluded, as the test in <em>Committee for Justice and
    Liberty et al. v. </em><em><span style='line-height:200%'>National Energy Board
    et al.</span></em><em><span style='line-height:200%;font-style:normal'>, [1978]
    1 S.C.R. 369, at p. 394, </span></em><em><span style='line-height:200%'>per </span></em><em><span
style='line-height:200%;font-style:normal'>de Grandpré J. (dissenting)</span></em> requires, that “an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and
    practically – and having thought the matter through … [w]ould … think that it is
    more likely than not that [the trial judge], whether consciously or
    unconsciously, would not decide fairly” either because of his rejection of the proposed
    settlement or his failure to provide reasons for rejecting the proposed settlement.
    Moreover, as noted above, the trial judge’s knowledge of the proposed settlement
    could serve to undermine only the respondent’s position, not the appellant’s. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that her bias allegation is supported in part by the
    trial judge’s assessment of the evidence. She argues that his reasons
    demonstrate an uneven weighing of the evidence. We do not accept this argument.
    The trial judge’s reasons fully explain his assessment of each party’s
    credibility and the contradictory evidence presented at trial. There is no
    basis for the appellant’s claim that his assessment of the evidence is indicative
    of bias.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, there is no basis for the appellant’s suggestion that the trial
    judge’s prior dealings with her as a counsel – a matter about which no concern was
    raised by the parties when it was disclosed by the trial judge at the outset of
    the trial – support the existence of a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, the appellant has not met her burden of establishing a
    reasonable apprehension of bias. In any event, it is far too late in the day to
    claim a reasonable apprehension of bias. It is well established that bias
    claims must be raised at the earliest practicable opportunity: <em>Canada
    (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor</em>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892, at pp. 941-43,
    971-72, citing <em>Re Human Rights Tribunal and Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.</em>,
    [1986] 1 F.C. 103 (C.A.). This rule not only avoids problems by affording the
    adjudicator an opportunity to determine the matter in a timely way, but also
    ensures that parties alleging bias do not seek to preserve appeal grounds in
    the event that they receive an unfavourable decision on the substantive matter
    in dispute. As we have noted, the appellant’s counsel was content to continue
    the trial after the trial judge rejected the proposed settlement. If the
    appellant wanted to raise a bias concern about the trial judge hearing the
    case, she had to raise it before the trial resumed and ran until its conclusion
    – long before an unfavourable judgment was rendered. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge made no errors in his decision on the merits that would permit
    this court to intervene</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well established that the key consideration that should determine
    the outcome of this appeal is the best interests of the children, as the <em><span
style='line-height:200%'>Divorce Act</span></em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.)
    makes plain. The best interests of the children is the only consideration
    relevant to deciding custody and access or their variation: see <em>Divorce Act</em>,<em> </em>ss. 16(8), 17(5). In thorough reasons, the trial judge explained why it
    was in the children’s best interest that they continue to reside in the Niagara
    region. His decision is owed considerable deference on appeal and cannot be
    interfered with absent a material error, a serious misapprehension of the
    evidence, or an error of law: <em>Van de Perre v. Edwards</em>, 2001 SCC 60,
    [2001] 2 S.C.R. 1014, at paras. 11, 13;<em> Perron v. Perron</em>, 2012 ONCA
    811, 113 O.R. (3d) 600, at para. 25, leave to appeal refused, [2013] S.C.C.A.
    No. 26. As noted above, the appellant did not directly address the merits of
    the trial judge’s reasons. No error in the trial judge’s findings and
    conclusions regarding the children’s best interests has been identified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge heard evidence from the parties and made findings of
    fact and credibility. He found that the respondent was essentially credible,
    but that the appellant was not. He found her point of view to be “basically
    unreasonable”, described some of her actions as “baffling”, and determined that
    her “strong desire to win seems to have clouded her judgment”. Those findings
    are entitled to deference, and the appellant has failed to establish any basis
    that would allow this court to interfere with them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that it was in the children’s best interest
    that they remain in the community where they were born and raised, and enrolled
    in the schools they currently attend. The trial judge made no error in doing so.
    The best interests of the children require that the order be upheld and the
    appeal dismissed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It remains open to the parties to seek a consent order varying the terms
    of the trial judge’s order, should they consider it appropriate to do so in
    light of their experience with the children since the trial judge’s order. There
    is, however, no basis for this court to intervene on appeal.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both parties brought motions to tender fresh evidence addressing how the
    children have progressed since the trial decision. In light of our conclusion
    that the appeal ought to be dismissed, we would not admit the fresh evidence.
    Nothing contained in the fresh evidence raises any concerns as to the
    correctness of the trial judge’s order.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge erred in principle in his costs order. There was no
    basis for the respondent to be awarded trial costs on an elevated scale. The
    appellant was entitled to seek a variation in the previous custody and access order
    and should not be punished for having done so. Her conduct was not “worthy of
    sanction”: <em>Net Connect Installation Inc. v. Mobile Zone Inc.</em>, 2017
    ONCA 766, 140 O.R. (3d) 77, at para. 8. While the appellant did not expressly
    seek leave to appeal the costs order, she did raise the issue of costs
    directly. We would grant leave in the circumstances and reduce the costs award
    to $30,000, inclusive of taxes and disbursements.</p>

    family law context. Indeed, the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99,
    directly provide that it is one of the ways in which the court promotes the
    primary objective. Rule 2(5) provides, in part:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>The court shall promote the

  <p align=center style='

  <p style='text-align:justify'>(b) encouraging and facilitating

    heightened when dealing with children. A settlement brings closure to the
    matter. It helps the parties refocus on the children’s best interests. It ends
    (or at least reduces) the present conflict and leads the way for the
    non-litigious resolution of future disputes. Further, it may benefit the
    children in that they will, hopefully, understand that the arrangements were
    agreed upon by their parents, rather than imposed by a court. This point was
    made by Tysoe J.A. in <i>F.J.V. v. W.K.S.</i>, 2019 BCCA 67, 18 R.F.L. (8th)
    255, at para. 29:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>It may not have been a perfect
    settlement, but as counsel for the respondent explained to the judge on January
    7, it is sometimes better to resolve most issues than none at all. A settlement
    of parenting issues does not have to be perfect in order for it to be in the
    best interests of the children. <u>The court must also consider the effects on
    the children of not having a settlement and, respectfully, the judge failed to
    consider those effects.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

    in a way that no trial judge (or external assessor) possibly could.
    Consequently, when parents negotiate a settlement on parenting issues, a judge
    must have clear and compelling reasons to reject it. If present, those reasons
    must be articulated to the parties so that they will understand the concerns
    and have an opportunity to respond. There may be any number of facts, of which
    the judge is unaware, that would explain why the parties agreed to the terms of
    the settlement.</span></p>

    prepared to approve it, he was required to tell the parties why and provide
    them with an opportunity to respond. The trial judge’s actions, in rejecting
    the settlement without explanation, fundamentally undermine the whole
    settlement process and its importance to the overall functioning of the
    litigation process, especially family litigation. His actions also deeply
    undercut the authority of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, and of judges generally,
    in urging parties to resolve their disputes. For a judge to reject a settlement
    on parenting issues without explanation undermines one of the most important

    para. 18:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>First, there is a strong policy
    in favour of the parties settling their own affairs, if possible. The exchange
    of offers to settle is to be encouraged. Litigants need to know that the terms

    trial judge may have been unwilling to give reasons for rejecting the
    settlement because his views on the settlement terms might, in some fashion,
    compromise his ongoing role as the trial judge. Indeed, my colleagues appear to
    implicitly adopt that possible explanation: at para. 28. They also appear to
    minimize the conduct of the trial judge by finding that the situation here was
    “exceptional”.</span></p>

    as justifying the trial judge’s actions. First, there is nothing exceptional
    about parties reaching a resolution of their dispute, either immediately before
    a trial starts, or after it has commenced. Experience demonstrates that many
    cases resolve “at the courtroom door” or soon after a trial commences. The
    immediacy of the moment does not excuse this judge’s handling of the
    settlement.</span></p>

    more fully below, given what occurred, the trial judge ought not to have
    continued to hear the trial and render a decision. His position as the trial

    of having to put aside evidence that they have heard, after concluding that it
    is inadmissible. We trust judges to do that. But those situations are the
    exception to the general rule that a judge, who is privy to resolution

    was the subject of the settlement conference. Rule 17(24) states: “A judge who

    does not apply and thus there was nothing in the <i>Family Law Rules</i> that
    precluded the trial judge from hearing the matter: at para. 35. While
    technically correct, that conclusion ignores the clear principle that underlies
    r. 17(24) which is that a judge, who is privy to the settlement discussions of
    the parties, ought not to then hear and decide their dispute. The reason behind
    the principle is clear. It is so the parties can pursue settlement while having
    confidence that the judge will decide the issue on the evidence and not on any
    extraneous information such as what position one party or the other took when
    settlement was discussed. This court has held as much in the context of civil
    pre-trials: <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Hussain</i>, 2016 ONCA 637, 133 O.R.

    that “Nor did his knowledge of the proposed settlement require him to recuse
    himself of his own motion.”: para. 35. I disagree. In my view, a judge who has
    received, but rejects, a settlement agreement is in an analogous position to a
    judge who has participated in a settlement conference. This was not a case
    where the trial judge became aware of peripheral information relating to the
    dispute. Here, the trial judge knew of the agreement that the parties had
    reached on the central issue that he was to determine, that is, where the
    principal residence of the children would be. One cannot equate that knowledge
    with a trial judge becoming aware of a piece of extraneous information that
    ought not to have made its way into the trial process. Here the trial judge’s
    knowledge went to the core issue in dispute. There is a fundamental difference
    between those two situations.</span></p>

    the impact on the losing party of him proceeding with the trial armed, as he
    was, with the parties’ resolution position. This is especially so when, at the
    time that the settlement was presented, the trial judge had heard one side’s
    evidence (in this case the appellant’s) but not the other side’s evidence. In
    that situation, to then continue with the trial, armed with the knowledge of
    the settlement, and find against the party whose evidence had been heard, could
    reasonably raise in the mind of the losing party (the appellant) that the judge
    had closed his mind. With respect, my colleagues’ conclusion, that only the
    respondent’s position could have been undermined by the trial judge knowing the
    settlement terms (at para. 44), ignores this salient point.</span></p>

    significant harm that would have been occasioned to the parties had the trial
    judge recused himself. The trial had just begun. Less than two days of evidence
    had been heard. There was nothing stopping the trial judge from recusing
    himself from the trial and arranging for another judge to recommence the trial
    the following day. The disruption and cost to the parties would have been

    the trial judge to recuse himself nor did either counsel ask for a mistrial. My
    colleagues place great emphasis on counsel’s failures to raise any objection as
    being sufficient to dispose of the problem. While, in some instances, the
    failure to object can be fatal to a later complaint, this court has said that
    we will relieve against the failure to object where the interests of justice
    require it<i>: Marshall v. Watson Wyatt &amp; Co.</i> (2002), 57 O.R. (3d) 813
    (C.A.), at para. 15. The actions of the trial judge, in his approach to the
    settlement, were so misguided, and so seriously undermined a fundamental
    principle of our legal process, that this court cannot ignore it, nor can we
    fail to remedy it, simply because of the omissions of trial counsel.<a

    knowledge, and of his reaction to it. Among other things, the losing party cannot
    be satisfied that that knowledge did not impact on the trial judge’s views of
    the evidence or on his conclusions. That reality taints the trial judge’s

    striking fact that the parents of the children had mutually agreed to a
    resolution that involved a diametrically opposite result for their children.
    That would appear to be a most powerful reason to doubt whether the result
    arrived at by the trial judge was actually in the best interests of the children.
    In that regard, courts have long recognized that parents are generally in the
    best position to decide what is in the best interests of their children: <i>B.

    appropriate remedy. Section 21(5) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3
    (2nd Supp.), authorizes an appellate court allowing an appeal to “(i) render
    the judgment or make the order that ought to have been rendered or made,
    including such order or such further or other order as it deems just; or (ii)
    order a new hearing where it deems it necessary to do so to correct a

    to have approved the parties’ negotiated settlement. A judge contemplating a
    variation order in respect of a custody order must take into consideration the
    best interests of the children only: <i>Divorce Act</i>, s. 17(5). The outcome
    that was the best for the children in this case was for the trial judge to give
    effect to the settlement. An order approving the settlement would have put into
    place the resolution that both parties agreed to. In reaching the settlement
    that they did, both parents had the best interests of the children in mind.
    Putting those agreed arrangements in place enforces those best interests and
    enforces the wishes of the parents as they were then expressed. I do not say
    that a settlement agreement between parents will always be in the best
    interests of the children, but I am confident that this is the case here. The
    traveling issues that appear to have so bothered the trial judge constitute an
    insufficient basis to reject a settlement that the parents carefully worked

    year. That reality is not a sufficient ground, though, to order a new trial for
    two reasons. First, is the time, expense, and prolonged uncertainty that such
    an order would visit on both parties. Second, is the reality that very little
    time has passed since the settlement was reached, particularly when one
    realizes that the settlement did not contemplate any change in the principal
    residence for the children until July of this year. Consequently, the
    disruption associated with the settlement, if now approved with effect from the
