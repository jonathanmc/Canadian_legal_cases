  <p class=Onappealfrom align=left style='text-align:left'>On appeal from the
    judgment of Justice Mario D. Faieta of the Superior Court of Justice, dated January
    25, 2019, with reasons reported at 2019 ONSC 342, 52 C.C.E.L. (4th) 50, and
    supplementary reasons, dated February 21, 2019, with reasons reported at 2019
    ONSC 1239, 52 C.C.E.L. (4th) 85.</p>
  <p><b>Strathy C.J.O.:</b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal concerns an issue that is being litigated with increasing
    frequency: the entitlement of a wrongfully dismissed employee to exercise stock
    options, receive bonuses, or take advantage of other aspects of his or her
    compensation package during the reasonable notice period.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the employer, IMAX, contended that the terms of the employee’s
    stock options and restricted share units (“RSUs”) prevented them from vesting
    after the date he was dismissed without cause. The motion judge rejected this
    submission, finding that the options and share units continued to vest during
    the reasonable notice period and that the employee was entitled to damages for the
    loss of the opportunity to exercise them.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employer appeals to this court, arguing that the language of these incentive
    agreements resulted in their cancellation on the effective termination date. It
    submits that the relevant contractual language is substantially the same as that
    in <em>Kieran v. Ingram Micro Inc.</em> (2004), 189 O.A.C. 58, leave to appeal
    refused, [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 423, in which this court found the employee’s
    options had been cancelled as a result of his dismissal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employee cross-appeals, claiming the motion judge erred in
    calculating his damages for the loss of the options and RSUs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both the appeal and the
    cross-appeal.</p>
  <h1>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Factual Background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, Larry O’Reilly, had been employed for 22 years with IMAX
    Corporation when he was dismissed as President, Institutional and Strategic
    Sales and Executive Vice President, Sales, on January 4, 2016. The termination was
    to be effective March 31, 2016.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>His compensation package included a base salary, commissions, group
    benefits, and participation in both a Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”), which
    included both RSUs and stock options, and a Stock Option Plan (collectively, the
    “awards”). The terms of the relevant plans are set out below.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a severance package, IMAX extended
    the effective termination date from March 31, 2016 to July 8, 2016. It advised
    Mr. O’Reilly that any awards that had already vested could be exercised for up
    to 30 days after the latter date. Any awards that had not vested as of that
    date would be “cancelled and forfeited without any consideration.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. O’Reilly brought an action for wrongful dismissal. The parties
    agreed that the issues could be dealt with by summary judgment.</p>
  <h1>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion Judge’s Reasons</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the respondent was entitled to damages,
    calculated on the basis of 24 months’ reasonable notice, together with all
    commissions outstanding at the date of termination. The judge also determined
    the respondent’s damages for wrongful dismissal, including the damages for lost
    opportunity to earn commissions on sales during the reasonable notice period,
    the pension contributions that would have been made during that period, and the
    value of benefits lost during the notice period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of these conclusions is subject to appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The remaining issue was the respondent’s claim that the awards were a
    fundamental part of his compensation and that he was entitled to damages for
    the lost opportunity to exercise the awards that would have vested during the
    reasonable notice period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that the respondent’s damages for the loss of
    the awards should be calculated on the basis of what would have probably
    happened had he remained employed until the end of the notice period. He noted
    that the respondent had exercised his options in the past and that he therefore
    would likely have done so in this case, had his employment not been terminated.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found that the language of the relevant awards was not
    sufficient to cancel the respondent’s entitlement to exercise the awards or to
    remove his entitlement to damages for their loss. He was therefore entitled to
    damages for the loss of the right to exercise the RSUs and stock options that
    would have vested during the reasonable notice period.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals this aspect of the judge’s order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that the respondent was entitled to damages, the motion
    judge was tasked with determining when the respondent would have exercised his right.
    The motion judge accepted the respondent’s evidence that he would have
    exercised the options at the “earliest possible opportunity”. However, as there
    were corporate policies that restricted the timing of the sale of the shares,
    he directed the parties to deliver further submissions on when the resulting
    shares would have been sold. Having received and heard those submissions, the
    motion judge issued supplementary reasons, calculating damages on the basis
    that the respondent would have sold the shares that vested during the
    reasonable notice period five months after their vesting date.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This determination is the subject of the cross appeal.</p>
  <h1>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Contractual Provisions</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The LTIP contained provisions for the award of both RSUs and stock
    options:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>RSUs under the LTIP</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of
    Restricted Share Units (“RSUs”). By accepting the RSUs, the Participant agrees
    to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the IMAX 2013 Long
    Term Incentive Plan (the “<em>IMAX LTIP</em>”). …</p>
  <p class=CQuote>4. <span class=Underline>Termination of Employment Generally</span>.
    In the event that the Participant’s employment with the Company terminates for
    any reason other than death, Disability or for Cause, the RSUs shall cease to
    vest and any unvested RSUs shall be cancelled immediately without consideration
    as of the date of such termination. Any vested RSUs shall continue to be
    settled on the applicable Settlement Date.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5. <span class=Underline>Death; Disability</span>. If the
    Participant’s employment with the Company terminates as a result of the
    Participant’s death or Disability, a portion of the RSUs shall vest such that,
    when combined with previously vested RSUs, an aggregate of 50% of the RSUs
    granted pursuant to the Agreement shall have vested. Any vested RSUs shall be
    settled on the applicable Settlement Date and any unvested RSUs shall be
    cancelled immediately without consideration as of the date of termination.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>6. <span class=Underline>Termination for Cause</span>. If the
    Participant’s employment with the Company terminates for Cause, any outstanding
    RSUs, whether or not vested, shall be cancelled immediately without
    consideration as of the date of termination, and the<a name="_Hlk535165557"> Participant
    shall have no further right or interest therein.</a></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Stock Option Grants under the LTIP</p>
  <p class=CQuote>This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions of
    Options. By accepting the Options, the Participant agrees to the terms and
    conditions set forth in this Agreement and the IMAX Corporation Long-Term
    Incentive Plan (the “<em>IMAX LTIP</em>”). … </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(5) <span class=Underline>Termination of Employment Generally</span>.
    In the event that the Participant’s employment with the Company terminates for
    any reason other than death, Disability or for Cause, the Options shall cease
    to vest, any unvested Options shall immediately be cancelled and revert back to
    the Company for no consideration and the Participant shall have no further
    right or interest therein. Any vested Options shall continue to be exercisable
    for a period of thirty (30) days following the date of such termination; … To
    the extent that any vested Options are not exercised within such period
    following termination of employment, such Options shall be cancelled and revert
    back to the Company for no consideration and the Participant shall have no
    further right or interest therein.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A separate Stock Option Plan provided for the award of stock options in
    addition to those provided under the LTIP. The relevant provision stated as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Stock Option Grants under the Stock Option Plan</p>
  <p class=CQuote>7. Termination of Employment, Consulting Agreement or Term of
    Office</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) In the event that a <em>Participant’s</em> employment,
    consulting arrangement or term of office with the <em>Company</em> or one of
    its <em>Subsidiaries</em> terminates for any reason, unless the <em>Board</em> or the <em>Committee</em> determines otherwise, any <em>Options</em> which have
    not become <em>Vested Options</em> shall terminate and be cancelled without any
    consideration being paid therefor. [Emphasis in original.]</p>

lang=EN-US>The governing principles</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principle underlying an award of damages for wrongful dismissal “is
    that the terminated employee is entitled to compensation for all losses arising
    from the employer’s breach of contract in failing to give proper notice”: <em>Paquette
    v. TeraGo Networks Inc.</em>, 2016 ONCA 618, 352 O.A.C. 1, at para. 16. The
    purpose of damages is to place the employee in the same financial position they
    would have been in had such notice been given: <em>Sylvester v. British
    Columbia</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 315, at para. 1. The goal, in other words, is to
    make the employee whole again.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has long been established that a wrongfully terminated employee is
    entitled to compensation for the loss of contractual benefits that they would

    benefits, bonuses, stock options, or other incentives: <em>Taggart v. Canada

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court’s decision in <em>Taggart</em>, Sharpe J.A. articulated
    the approach to be taken by courts in determining an employee’s claim. At para.
    12 of his decision, he stated: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my opinion, the proper way to analyze the respondent’s claim
    is to consider: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>his common law right to damages
    for breach of contract, and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>whether the terms of the [contract]
    alter or remove a common law right.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With regards to the first inquiry, the employee will have a common law
    right to damages where they would have earned a benefit but for the employer’s
    breach of contract: <em>Taggart</em>, at para. 20. This will generally be the
    case where the benefit can be described as an “integral part” of the terminated
    employee’s compensation: <em>Paquette</em>, at paras. 17, 30; <em>Lin v.
    Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan</em>, 2016 ONCA 619, 402 D.L.R. (4th) 325, at
    para. 86.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a common law right is established, “the question at this stage is
    whether there is something in the language of the [contract] between the
    parties that takes away or limits that common law right”: <em>Taggart</em>, at
    para. 20. In the context of a stock option plan, therefore, the question is
    whether there is language in the plan that specifically removes the employee’s
    common law entitlement. As noted by van Rensburg J.A. in <em>Paquette</em>,
    however, “[t]he question is not whether the contract or plan is ambiguous, but
    whether the wording of the plan unambiguously alters or removes the
    [employee’s] common law rights”: at para. 31. In undertaking this analysis, the
    proper focus is on the wording of the particular plan: <em>Kieran</em>, at
    para. 58, citing <em>Brock v. Matthews Group Ltd.</em> (1991), 43 O.A.C. 369,
    at para. 22.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A number of decisions of this court have applied these general
    principles in the context of stock option plans. For instance, in <em>Brock</em>,
    the court held that an employee was not entitled to exercise his options up to
    the expiration of the period of reasonable notice because the relevant plans
    established that, regardless of the mode of termination, his right was extinguished
    on his “<span class=Underline>ceasing to be an employee</span>” and that any
    options had to be exercised “15 days <span class=Underline>from the date notice
    of dismissal</span> is given”: at paras. 14, 16, 22-23 (emphasis in original). The
    language thus unambiguously removed the common law right.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In contrast, in <em>Veer</em>, Goudge J.A. held that an employee was entitled
    to exercise his stock options up to the end of the notice period because,
    unlike in <em>Brock</em>, the language of the plan did not expressly extinguish
    his rights on wrongful dismissal. The relevant contractual language was as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If the option holder’s employment with the corporation … <span
class=Underline>is terminated for any reason other than set forth in paragraphs
    6, 7 or 8 above</span> [death, retirement or incapacity], <span
class=Underline>whether such termination be voluntary or involuntary</span>,
    without his having fully exercised his option, the option shall be cancelled
    and he shall have no further rights to exercise his option or any part thereof
    and all of his rights hereunder shall terminate as of the effective date of
    such termination. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goudge J.A. rejected the appellant’s argument that the inclusion of the
    reference to <span class=Underline>involuntary</span> termination (i.e.,
    termination initiated by the employer), necessarily included wrongful
    termination without notice. He observed, at para. 14:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, “voluntary” termination refers to a termination
    that is consensual or initiated by the employee, whereas “involuntary”
    termination is that initiated by the employer. In either case, the termination
    contemplated must, I think, mean termination according to law. Absent express
    language providing for it, I cannot conclude that the parties intended that an
    unlawful termination would trigger the end of the employee’s option rights. The
    agreement should not be presumed to have provided for unlawful triggering
    events. <span class=Underline>Rather, the parties must be taken to have
    intended that the triggering actions would comply with the law in the absence
    of clear language to the contrary</span>. There is no such language in these stock
    option agreements. [Emphasis added.]<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in <em>Gryba</em>, the majority of the court held that,
    while, as in <em>Brock</em>, the plan spoke of the optionee “ceasing to be
    employed”, it also established that the “date for the exercise of stock options
    is 30 days following the <em>effective</em> date of termination”. The majority
    found that the effective date “would include the notice period” and therefore
    the employee was entitled to claim damages: at para. 51 (emphasis in original).
    For the majority, the plan was distinct from the one at issue in <em>Brock</em>,
    where the right was to be extinguished regardless of whether the mode of
    termination was lawful or unlawful:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The wording of the stock option plan in this case can be read
    as contemplating a lawful notice of termination and the effective date of the
    cessation of employment is the end of the notice period. Our interpretation is
    supported by the fact that the stock option clause also provides that in the
    event of death or dismissal for cause the employee has no right to exercise
    stock options: at para. 51.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, while <em>Paquette</em> dealt with the right to receive bonuses,
    not stock options, van Rensburg J.A. reviewed a series of stock option cases,
    including <em>Kieran</em>, <em>Gryba</em>, <em>Veer</em>, and <em>Brock</em>. She
    noted that the timing of the exercise of an option is key to its value to an
    employee and that the cases have required clear language to limit the right to
    exercise options on termination. Language such as “termination” or “cessation”
    of employment has been insufficient to prevent the exercise of an option during
    the wrongful dismissal period: at paras. 40-41. She suggested that the approach
    in these cases can be summed up by the language of Goudge J.A. in <em>Veer</em>:
    “the parties must be taken to have intended that the triggering actions [for
    the cancellation of an employee’s stock option rights] would comply with the
    law in the absence of clear language to the contrary”: <em>Paquette</em>, at
    para. 42, citing to <em>Veer</em>, at para. 14.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A useful summary of the principles set out in <em>Taggart</em>, <em>Lin</em>,
    and <em>Paquette</em> is provided in <em>Manastersky</em>, at paras. 39-43. At
    the risk of paraphrasing Brown J.A., in light of the foregoing analysis, I would
    further summarize as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. A wrongfully dismissed employee is
    entitled to damages for the loss of wages, salary and other benefits, that
    would have been earned during the reasonable notice period.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. This principle applies to bonuses,
    stock options, or incentives that are an integral part of the employee’s
    compensation, as well as pension benefits that would have accrued or been
    earned during the reasonable notice period.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. In considering whether the loss of
    such benefits is recoverable, the court undertakes a two-step analysis. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>4. The first step requires a
    determination of the employee’s common law right to damages for breach of
    contract, bearing in mind that the measure of damages is the amount to which
    the employee would have been entitled had the employer performed the contract.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5. The second step requires the court
    to determine whether the terms of the relevant contract or plan unambiguously
    alter or remove the employee's common law rights, having regard to the
    presumption that the parties intended to apply the law, in the absence of clear
    language to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before applying these principles to the facts of this case, I will
    address the appellant’s submission <span lang=EN-US>that the contractual
    language here is on all fours with the contract in </span><em>Kieran</em><span
lang=EN-US> and that the appeal must therefore be allowed.</span></p>
  <h5><em><span style='font-style:normal'>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em>Kieran v. Ingram Micro Inc.</em></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant does not dispute the principles set out above. Rather, as
    I have noted, it simply takes the position that the contractual language in <em>Kieran</em> is substantially the same as the language of the IMAX contract and that the
    outcome in this case should therefore be the same. The appellant points out
    that the respondent has not asked the court to strike a five-judge panel for
    the purpose of hearing argument that <em>Kieran</em> should be overruled.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would not accept the appellant’s
    submission that <em>Kieran</em> is dispositive of this case. The contractual
    language is not substantially the same.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Kieran was a Senior Vice President of Ingram Micro Inc. This court
    reversed the trial judge’s finding that he had resigned from his position and
    instead found that he had been constructively dismissed. However, it found that
    he had successfully mitigated his damages by finding alternative employment and
    thus sustained no damages. This court also affirmed the trial judge’s dismissal
    of his claim for damages of $1.2 million for the loss of stock options that
    would have vested during the period of reasonable notice. The court’s decision
    was based on a finding that, despite the existence of a common law right to
    damages, that right was effectively extinguished by unambiguous language in the
    relevant stock option plans.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Kieran</em>, there were three plans at issue: (a) the Restricted
    Plan; (b) the Equity Plan and (c) the Rollover Plan. The language of the Restricted
    and Equity plans was quite similar, while the Rollover Plan was somewhat distinct.
    The appellant submits that the language in the Rollover Plan is substantially
    the same as in the plans in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Restricted Plan provided:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>If Participant’s employment with Micro or any Affiliate <span
class=Underline>is terminated for any reason</span> other than death,
    disability … or retirement… prior to the time when all Shares have become
    Unrestricted Shares …, Restricted Shares… shall be repurchased by Micro at the
    lower of (x) the Purchase Price and (y) the Fair Market Value of such Shares on
    the Repurchase Date. … <span class=Underline>[A]ny termination of a
    participant’s employment for any reason shall occur on the date Participant
    ceases to perform services for Micro or any Affiliate without regard to whether
    Participant continues thereafter to receive any compensatory payments therefrom
    or is paid salary thereby in lieu of notice of termination</span>. [Emphasis
    added].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Equity Plan provided:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Except as the Committee may at any time otherwise provide or as
    required to comply with applicable law, if the Participant’s employment with
    Micro or its Affiliates <span class=Underline>is terminated for any reason</span> other than death, disability, or retirement, the Participant’s right to
    exercise any Non-Qualified Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right <span
class=Underline>shall terminate</span> and such Option or Stock Appreciation
    Right shall expire, on … the sixtieth day following such termination of
    employment. [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Equity Plan also gave an employee leaving by reason of death,
    disability, or retirement a one-year period within which to exercise his or her
    options. As well, like the Restricted Plan, the Equity plan defined the date on
    which the employee ceased to perform services as “<span class=Underline>without
    regard to whether the employee continues thereafter to receive any compensatory
    payments therefrom or is paid salary thereby in lieu of notice of termination</span>”
    (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Rollover Plan provided:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Except as the Committee may at any time otherwise provide or as
    required to comply with applicable law, if the Participant’s employment with
    the Participant’s Employer or any of its Subsidiaries is <span class=Underline>terminated
    for any reason</span> other than death, permanent and total disability,
    retirement or Cause, the Participant’s right to exercise any Non-Qualified
    Stock Option <span class=Underline>shall terminate</span>, and such Option
    shall expire on… the 60th day following such termination of employment. [Emphasis
    added].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Rollover Plan was distinct because it “did not specifically address,
    as did the Restricted and Equity Plans, a situation where the employee was
    given compensatory payments in lieu of notice of termination”: at para. 52.
    However, the “General Provisions” of the Rollover Plan provided that the “employer
    could dismiss the employee at <span class=Underline>any time</span>, ‘<span
class=Underline>free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or
    otherwise, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Option
    Agreement</span>’” (emphasis added). The plan provided exceptions from this
    general provision for employees terminated by death, disability, or retirement.
    In these cases, the employees would have one year to exercise their options,
    post-employment. No exception was provided for employees terminated without
    cause.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the provisions of the plans dealing with the
    employee’s rights on termination were “virtually identical”: <em>Kieran v.
    Ingram Micro Inc.</em>, [2001] O.J. No. 4318 (S.C.), at para. 60. He held that
    “the language in the plans in the instant case clearly contemplates a
    termination made ‘unlawful’ by no, or too little, notice and provides that in
    determining the date of termination, any continuing compensation or salary in
    lieu of notice is to be disregarded”: at para. 66.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court affirmed the trial judge’s decision, finding that the
    language of the plans was unambiguous. In examining the specific language of
    the three stock option plans, Lang J.A. made three key observations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the plans unambiguously stated that Mr. Kieran’s right to
    exercise his stock options would expire if his employment was terminated for
    “any reason” other than death, disability, retirement (or cause, in the case of
    the Rollover Plan): at paras. 59-60.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the Restricted and Equity plans “specifically provided that Mr.
    Kieran’s employment terminated on the date he ceased to perform services,
    without regard to whether he continued to receive compensatory payments or
    salary in lieu of notice”: at para. 59.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And third, the Rollover Plan provided that the “employer could dismiss
    the employee at any time ‘free from any liability or any claim under the Plan
    or otherwise, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Option
    Agreement’”: at para. 51. The plan provided that if an employee was terminated
    by reason of death, disability, or retirement, they would have one year to
    exercise their options, post employment: at para. 50. It did not make any
    express statements regarding avenues of claim for employees in the event they
    were terminated by wrongful dismissal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of these observations, Lang J.A. found that all three plans
    excluded a claim for shares or options that vested during the reasonable notice
    period. An examination of all three plans demonstrated that the relevant
    provisions had two features, expressed in one way in the Restricted Plan and
    the Equity Plan and another way in the Rollover Plan. First, each plan
    established that an employee terminated without cause would have no entitlement
    to exercise any option rights and, second, each plan determined when that would
    occur. The Restricted Plan and the Equity Plan established that termination
    would occur on the date the employee ceased to perform services whether or not
    he or she continued to receive salary in lieu of notice. These provisions
    clearly and unambiguously took away the employee’s common law rights. The
    Rollover Plan, while using different language, removed the right to exercise
    the stock option on “termination”, and went on to provide, in the general
    conditions, that the employer could dismiss the employee <span class=Underline>at
    any time</span>, “free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or
    otherwise.” While “termination”, without more, refers to lawful termination,
    the additional language of the general conditions was sufficient to expressly
    remove that presumption.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But for the additional language in all three plans, the words
    “terminate” or “termination”, would have been ambiguous. They could refer to
    the date notice was given or to the end of the reasonable notice period. In
    light of that ambiguity, they would have been interpreted as requiring the
    latter, namely, “termination according to law” at the end of the reasonable
    notice period. However, the ambiguity was removed by the additional language and,
    with it, so was the employee’s common law right.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Kieran was thus bound by the “plain language” of the plans, his
    right to exercise the options was not extended by the period of reasonable
    notice, and he was not entitled to damages for the loss of the options.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the language of the Rollover Plan in <em>Kieran</em> is substantially the same as the language of the plans in this case.
    Consequently, the respondent’s awards should be found to have ceased to vest on
    the effective date of his termination.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to that argument. While the language in all the
    plans at issue in this case extinguish the respondent’s right to exercise any
    unvested awards as of the date of “termination” or when employment
    “terminates”, they do not establish, in unambiguous terms, when the date of
    termination is or when employment terminates. In other words, they leave open
    the possibility that termination could have occurred at the end of the
    reasonable notice period. And, as expressed above, where such ambiguity exists,
    the language will be interpreted as mandating a lawful termination.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellant is correct to note that the language of the IMAX plans
    and the Rollover Plan in <em>Kieran</em> are similar, he overlooks the fact
    that, in <em>Kieran</em>, additional language was used to remove any
    entitlement to damages. There was no such language in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore reject the appellant’s argument that we are bound by <em>Kieran</em>.
    In light of this conclusion, the next step is to determine whether the motion
    judge correctly applied the governing principles and arrived at the correct conclusion.</p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-US>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Application of the principles to this case</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge identified and expressly applied the principles set out
    above, referring to, among others, <em>Veer</em>, <em>Taggart</em>, and <em>Paquette</em>.
    He found as a fact that the awards were an integral part of the respondent’s
    employment, that they would have vested had his employment not been wrongfully
    terminated, and that he would have exercised the awards, as he had done in the
    past. This was the first step in the <em>Taggart/Paquette</em> analysis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the application of the second step, the motion judge, referring to <em>Veer</em>,
    found that the reference to “terminates for any reason” in the plans could not
    be presumed to refer to termination without cause. Further, he found that the
    phrase “cancelled immediately without consideration” was not “a clear, express
    provision that remove[d] the common law right of an employee, terminated
    without cause, to claim damages in respect of lost unvested RSUs”: at para. 64.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge applied the correct legal principles and arrived at the
    correct conclusion. As I have explained in the discussion of <em>Kieran</em>, above,
    in the absence of unambiguous contractual language, as there was in <em>Kieran</em>,
    the awards continued to vest during the reasonable notice period. The
    respondent was entitled to damages for the loss of his entitlement to exercise
    his rights.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thrust of the respondent’s cross-appeal is that, having accepted the
    plaintiff’s evidence that “he would have exercised the RSU and stock option
    grants at the earliest possible opportunity”, the motion judge erred by
    concluding that he would have sold the shares five months after their vesting
    dates. This conclusion was based on an analysis of the plaintiff’s actual sales
    activities during the reasonable notice period in respect of other RSUs and
    stock options. The motion judge did not characterize this analysis as being in
    conflict with his earlier finding, but simply a determination of the meaning of
    “earliest possible opportunity.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cross-appellant makes several submissions, including: (a) that the motion
    judge breached the rules of natural justice by permitting IMAX to re-argue an
    issue that had been previously decided; (b) that IMAX breached the requirement
    to put its “best foot forward” on a summary judgment motion; (c) that IMAX was
    guilty of litigation by instalment, by adducing fresh evidence on the damages
    issue; and (d) that the motion judge’s conclusion that he would have retained
    his shares in a falling market amounted to a palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to any of these submissions. I do not see this
    as a case of re-opening the “trial”, as occurred in <em>671122 Ontario Ltd. v.
    Sagaz Industries Canada Inc.</em>, 2001 SCC 59, [2001] S.C.R. 983. The motion
    judge had not come to any final conclusion on the quantum of damages and had
    expressly left that issue open. I would defer to the exercise of his discretion
    in adopting a process that was fair to both parties and that ensured that both
    parties had an opportunity to make full submissions on the issues. The cross-appellant
    made no objection to the so-called “fresh evidence” and indeed referred to that
    evidence in his submissions on damages, urging a different interpretation on
    the motion judge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did the motion judge make a palpable and overriding error in his
    assessment of the evidence concerning damages. He rejected IMAX’s approach to
    the calculation of damages – the use of the average number of months the
    cross-appellant had taken to sell vested incentives prior to the termination of
    his employment (13.7 months) – which he found was an overstatement. Instead, he
    looked at the evidence concerning the cross-appellant’s actual sales during the
    reasonable notice period. This was an appropriate approach to take. As for the cross-appellant’s
    argument that he would have sold immediately in a falling market, he admitted,
    as he had to, that he had no way of knowing whether the price would go up or
    down.</p>
