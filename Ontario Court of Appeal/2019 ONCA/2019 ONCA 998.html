  <p><b>Huscroft J.A.:</b></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant pleaded guilty to five charges arising
    out of his participation in a violent home invasion. He was sentenced to a term
    of 15 months’ imprisonment, which included a 12-month mandatory minimum penalty
    for one charge of use of an imitation firearm in the commission of an offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant seeks to have his guilty pleas
    struck because of the ineffective assistance of counsel. He says that trial
    counsel did not properly advise him as to the strength of the Crown’s case and
    his potential defences, and that he did not understand he was pleading guilty
    to an imitation firearm charge and that it carried a mandatory minimum sentence.
    The appellant informed the court that he has abandoned his sentence appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I conclude that the appellant’s plea to the
    imitation firearm charge must be struck on the basis that it was uninformed,
    and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in respect of the four
    additional charges.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would allow the appeal for the reasons that
    follow.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Jeremy Draper was a drug dealer. On February 23,
    2016, he was contacted by a man seeking to buy marijuana, and arrangements were
    made to complete the purchase at his home on February 26, 2016. The appellant
    and seven other men drove to Draper’s home in two cars. The appellant was armed
    with a metal baseball bat and the other men brought their own weapons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At approximately 1:45 a.m., one of the
    appellant’s co-accused was invited into Draper’s home. Shortly afterwards, a
    group of six men rushed into the home and assaulted Draper. He was hit twice
    with a metal baseball bat and one of the intruders pointed an imitation firearm
    at his face. He fled into a bedroom and locked himself in with his girlfriend.
    Draper’s roommate, Spencer Gorman, came out of his room and was beaten with the
    baseball bat and a baton, and was kicked and punched. He suffered several
    injuries before returning to his bedroom and barricading his door. The
    intruders stole numerous items including a laptop computer, a video game system,
    and approximately 68 grams of marijuana.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and four co-accused fled from the
    scene in a blue BMW. Three unidentified men fled in a white car. The white car
    was never found but the blue BMW was stopped by the police approximately 15
    minutes after the incident. The appellant’s brother was driving the BMW and the
    appellant was in the front seat. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>All of the occupants were arrested and the car
    was searched incident to the arrests. Among other things, the police found a
    jar containing approximately 68 grams of marijuana, three pieces of pre-cut
    duct tape, a grey and black balaclava, a grey neck warmer, the missing laptop
    computer, a baton handle (the bottom portion of which was found inside Draper’s
    home), blue latex gloves, and two black replica firearms.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>THE FRESH EVIDENCE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial record in this case is brief. It is
    supplemented by affidavits sworn by the appellant, his father, trial counsel,
    and the appellant’s parole officer, all of whom were cross-examined by Crown
    counsel in accordance with this court’s protocol for claims of ineffective
    assistance of counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown concedes that the fresh evidence
    should be admitted. This concession is appropriate. In my view, it is in the
    interests of justice to admit the evidence pursuant to s. 683(1) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The appellant retains counsel and gets bail</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Howard Goldkind was retained by the
    appellant’s father, Barrington Beckford, following the appellant’s arrest. He
    knew Mr. Goldkind and considered him a friend. Mr. Goldkind also agreed to act
    for the appellant’s brother. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Goldkind secured the release of both the
    appellant and his brother following contested bail hearings. I will refer to
    Mr. Goldkind as trial counsel for the balance of these reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s meetings with trial counsel</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant says that he never met with trial
    counsel at his office. Their initial meeting was at a restaurant and subsequent
    meetings were held in waiting areas and anterooms at the Guelph courthouse,
    before and after court appearances. Trial counsel confirms that he never met
    with the appellant at his office but says that he spoke with the appellant many
    times by telephone and had a long meeting with him on November 24, 2016, just
    before the appellant pleaded guilty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant says that he repeatedly told trial
    counsel that he was eager to move forward with his case, as he found the bail
    conditions stressful and was concerned that they might interfere with his plans
    to seek a patent for an algorithm he had developed. Trial counsel acknowledges
    that the appellant claimed he was working on a patent, but he described this as
    “pipe dreams” and “ludicrous” and said he “didn’t give it a minute’s credence.”
    He “thought it was an absolute joke.” However, he also acknowledges that the
    appellant was keen to get the matter dealt with and move on with his life.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The judicial pre-trial</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A pre-trial was held on September 9, 2017 in the
    Ontario Court of Justice before the trial judge. The appellant says that trial
    counsel informed him following the pre-trial that if he pleaded guilty to four
    counts (break and enter, two counts of assault with a weapon, and possession of
    marijuana), the remaining charges would be withdrawn. He says that trial
    counsel told him that the Crown was seeking a 16-month sentence, which might be
    reduced to a lengthy period of probation or a period of house arrest if he had
    a good pre-sentence report. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial counsel testified that, following the
    meeting, he informed the appellant that the Crown would be seeking a sentence
    of 12-18 months if the appellant pleaded guilty to four charges. He considered
    this a “very attractive” outcome.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial counsel denies that he told the appellant
    he might be able to avoid jail. He did testify, however, that he “was confident
    that he had without question the one Judge in that jurisdiction who would not
    send him to the penitentiary; the one Judge in that jurisdiction who would be
    impressed by the pleas and the PSR [pre-sentence report] and that he’d be
    foolish not to take advantage of that.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The decision to plead guilty</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant says that he would not have
    pleaded guilty if he had known that he was certain to be sentenced to a jail
    term. He says that he decided to plead guilty on the understanding that he
    might be able to avoid going to jail and that the evidence against him was
    conclusive of his guilt, including DNA and fingerprint evidence that trial
    counsel told him was in the additional disclosure package he had received. The
    appellant maintains that he was not advised that he would be pleading to the
    imitation firearm charge, or that this charge included a 12-month mandatory minimum
    term of imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial counsel denies informing the appellant
    that there was DNA or fingerprint evidence that inculpated him. He testified
    that he did not read the DNA report and did not know whether there was
    fingerprint evidence. He says that he offered the disclosure to the appellant but
    the appellant declined to read it, saying that he wanted to plead guilty to the
    charges.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Entering the guilty pleas</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 24, 2016, counsel for the Crown advised
    the court that she was seeking guilty pleas to counts three, five, eight, eleven,
    and the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i> S.C. 1996, c. 19 (the “<i>CDSA</i>”)
    count for possession of marijuana charge — a total of five of 12 counts in the
    two informations. Trial counsel stated, “I just have four counts that we were
    going to resolve.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The court noted that the marijuana charge was on
    a separate information, and both Crown counsel and trial counsel indicated
    their agreement. Crown counsel reiterated that she was seeking guilty pleas to
    counts three, five, eight, eleven, and the separate marijuana count.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial counsel informed the court that he had
    conducted a plea inquiry with the appellant. The following exchange took place:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Goldkind: I can indicate to Your Honour,
    subject to your queries I’ve very carefully explained to my client the
    ramifications of the giving up of the right to a trial…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Court: Right.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Goldkind: …etcetera, etcetera, but I, I
    did indicate to him that that’s always subject to queries from Your Honour.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Court: Okay, I don’t need to – with
    experienced counsel like you I certainly don’t need to make an inquiry. I
    assume your client understands his options with respect to going…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Goldkind: Come forward, sir.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Court: …going to trial and wants to be
    tried in this court today and waives the reading of the election?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Goldkind: His exact words, Your Honour,
    which I’ll reiterate, are he wants to resolve this and move on with his life.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Court: Okay, all right, in this court…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Goldkind: In this …</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Court: …today?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>M. Goldkind: …court.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Court: Thank you.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Goldkind: Right?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Immanuel Beckford: Yes.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>The Court: arraign him, please.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not conduct a plea inquiry.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was then arraigned on five charges: break and enter of a dwelling-house
    (s. 348(1)(b)); use of an imitation firearm while committing an indictable
    offence (s. 85(2)(a)); assault with a weapon: baseball bat (s. 267(a)); assault
    with a weapon: metal baseball bat &amp; baton (s. 267(a)); and possession of
    cannabis (s. 4(1) of the <em>CDSA</em>). He pleaded guilty following the
    reading of each charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Trial counsel acknowledged the facts after they
    were read in. The trial judge then stated: “[The appellant is] a party to those
    offences.” Trial counsel replied: “Absolutely.” The court then entered findings

    2017 ONCA 642, at para. 17.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the prejudice component, the appellant argues that he
    pleaded guilty in reliance on trial counsel’s advice, believing that trial
    counsel had assessed the case against him when, in fact, he had failed to do
    so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that, if this is the case, a finding of prejudice should
    follow. The appellant need not show that he had a viable defence to the charges
    against him in order to have his pleas set aside. As the Supreme Court has
    stated, prejudice results from pleading guilty and thereby giving up the right
    to trial: <em>Wong</em>, at para. 23, citing <em>R. v. Rulli</em>, 2011 ONCA
    18, at para. 2; see also <em>R. v. Quick</em>, 2016 ONCA 95, 129 O.R. (3d) 334,
    at para. 38.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The performance component relates to trial counsel’s alleged
    incompetence. The assessment “proceeds from a strong presumption of competence,
    is tested against a standard of reasonableness, and accords no place to
    hindsight”: <em>Cherrington</em>, at para. 26. The main issues are whether the
    appellant has established the facts necessary to ground his claim and whether
    those facts reflect the incompetence of trial counsel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the Crown submits that the appellant has failed to meet his
    burden to establish the facts on which his claim for ineffective assistance of
    counsel is grounded. She says that the appellant’s version of events is not
    reasonably capable of belief: his account is inconsistent and evasive, and he
    has a strong motivation to fabricate his claims. According to Crown counsel,
    the evidence of trial counsel should be preferred. She emphasizes the
    presumption in favour of competence and highlights trial counsel’s lengthy career
    at the criminal bar. The case against the appellant was strong and it was
    reasonable to think that the appellant was at risk of receiving a lengthy
    penitentiary term if convicted. Trial counsel, she submits, exercised
    reasonable judgment in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded by the appellant’s evidence at various points. It is,
    as the Crown suggests, self-serving to say the least. If there were no
    additional evidence, the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel would fail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But trial counsel’s evidence establishes the facts necessary to support
    the appellant’s claim. Indeed, it is clear from a reading of trial counsel’s
    evidence that his performance did not fall within the range of reasonable
    professional assistance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plainly, trial counsel formed the view that the case against the
    appellant was so strong — and the deal offered was so advantageous — that the
    appellant should plead guilty. Nevertheless, it was trial counsel’s duty to assess
    the strength of the evidence against the appellant before advising him, and his
    own evidence establishes that he did not adequately do so. That evidence
    suggests that trial counsel’s knowledge of the appellant’s guilt — and disapproval
    of the appellant’s actions — led to his failure to take appropriate actions on the
    appellant’s behalf.</p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Identification evidence</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel was examined at length concerning the ability of the
    occupants of the house that was invaded to identify the appellant. He testified
    that the appellant admitted to him that he went into the house, “swinging the
    bats”. The following exchange took place:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: That’s not the question, Mr. Goldkind. I’m sorry to
    interrupt you. The question is not whether [the appellant] said he was in the
    house. The question is what discussions did you have with him about the ability
    of the Crown’s witnesses to identify him?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: I think all I can say is that when a client admits quite
    openly that he went in the house; was wielding the bat like a bludgeon and enjoyed
    every minute of it, that tells me that there is no need to examine him further
    about the identification.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: Because you say [the appellant] admitted the offense to you,
    you thought you had no obligation to test the strength of the Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: No, I won’t go that far, but it’s very significant to me
    when a client admits openly and with pleasure his role in the matter. That’s a
    very telling factor.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: So I just want to understand exactly what you’re saying.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: Sure.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: Is it your position that because [the appellant] admitted to
    you his presence in the house, that your obligation to test the Crown’s case
    and to consider whether they could actually prove it if it went to trial was no
    longer your obligation?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: I’ll answer it this way. When Michael Beckford [the
    appellant’s brother] admitted to me that he drove the car and waited outside
    purposely and when [the appellant] admitted to me his role in the matter and
    what he took with him in the house, that stops me from cross-examining my
    client about the strength of the Crown’s witnesses.</p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>The appellant’s Charter
    rights</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel acknowledged that he does not know whether the appellant
    called counsel while he was in custody after arrest and did not discuss the
    matter with him because he did not think it was relevant. Nor did he query the
    circumstances of the appellant’s strip-search, the fact that he was held for
    approximately 10 hours without being brought before a justice before he gave
    his statement, or the propriety of the police request for the appellant to
    provide his cell phone password. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, trial counsel did not consider possible <em>Charter</em> claims the appellant might have made. His evidence was that “the police had
    treated [the appellant] extremely fairly in all circumstances”; that the police
    hadn’t roughed him up or intimidated him but had “treated him like a gentleman”;
    and that he “hadn’t been mistreated in any way, shape or form”. </p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>The appellant’s police statement</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel was asked a series of questions concerning the appellant’s
    police statement. He rejected the suggestion that the appellant’s statement to
    the police that he was “outside the house” is at least partially exculpatory of
    the appellant, describing the suggestion as “ludicrous” and “quibbling with the
    semantics”. The statement was not totally truthful, in his view. He testified: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: So from your point of view you’re satisfied that he went
    into the house, therefore what his statement says is irrelevant to your
    assessment of the strength of the Crown’s case?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: Absolutely correct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was put to trial counsel that the appellant’s statement was ambiguous
    and potentially exculpatory concerning his knowledge of imitation firearms. For
    example, the appellant stated that his brother has a replica BB gun, “but I
    know he didn’t have it on him”; that “it’s possible” one of the other guys
    brought it; that “I don’t know exactly” what weapons the men in the white car
    brought; and that “I didn’t see” a sawed-off shotgun, but someone else
    mentioned it. Trial counsel gave the following evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: I’m going to suggest to you, again, that the statement makes
    it plain that he’s – whether or not it’s true, whether or not it’s true, that
    he’s making assumptions about whether or not there’s a gun, a replica shotgun;
    correct?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: Sir, I’ve been dealing with criminals for 50 years. This is
    a perfect illustration of a young man who was wanting to tell the truth, but
    not wanting to rat out other people. He’s deflecting; he’s minimizing his role.
    He knew darn well there was a shotgun; he knew there was an imitation gun.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: But that’s not apparent on the face of his statement; is it?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: It’s apparent to me. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: That’s not what he’s –</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: It’s apparent to anybody with any knowledge of the criminal
    system and criminal conduct. Read it carefully. It’s as clear as day.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: So you don’t think that that portion of the statement is
    exculpatory –</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: Not at all.</p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>The DNA and fingerprint
    evidence</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial counsel denies that he told the appellant there was DNA evidence
    inculpating him, but his evidence raises a different problem: he admits that he
    did not even read the DNA report. He denies telling the appellant that
    fingerprint evidence inculpated him and says that he offered the fingerprint
    evidence to the appellant at the courthouse. However, when it was suggested to
    him that there was no fingerprint evidence, he acknowledged that he does not
    know whether or not this was because he did not read the disclosure package
    provided on the day of the judicial pre-trial:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: If there’s no [fingerprint] evidence you couldn’t have
    offered it to him, could you?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: No, I offered him the package that the police gave me at the
    courthouse.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: But you didn’t consider that package at all because you
    didn’t think it important?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: Why would I consider it, sir, when the client told me that
    he’s guilty and he wants to plead guilty?</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Q: Well, because you might want to consider whether it’s in
    your client’s interest to plead guilty based on an assessment of the Crown’s
    case.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>A: Well, with all due respect, you’re being a Monday morning
    quarterback, which is foolish. A client tells you he did it; the client wants
    to get on with it; the client wants to do his time; he wants to avoid the penitentiary;
    end of story. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>It’s not my obligation to cross-examine a client to rip apart
    his possible defences. You’ve got my position.</p>
  <p class=Heading><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>The reasonableness of
    counsel’s performance</span></i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, trial counsel’s evidence establishes that he never met with
    the appellant at his office; did not obtain written instructions; did not
    review the DNA disclosure package; did not adequately assess the strength of
    the Crown’s case; did not consider possible <em>Charter</em> infringements; and
    made no submissions as to the appropriate sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The recurring theme in trial counsel’s evidence is an insistence that
    his knowledge of the appellant’s guilt obviated the need for him to take the
    sorts of steps that would normally be taken before advising an accused person regarding
    a guilty plea. Moreover, trial counsel’s evidence is replete with inappropriate
    criticism of his client and disapproval of his conduct and character. For
    example, he testified that the appellant treated the matter as “a caper” and a
    “big joke”. Trial counsel said that the appellant enjoyed hitting people with
    the bat and “seemed to revel in what he had done.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever trial counsel may have thought of his client, it was his duty
    to represent him to the best of his abilities. He was required to evaluate the
    strength of the evidence against the appellant before advising him to enter a guilty
    plea, no matter how advantageous he thought that plea would be. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The shortcomings in the representation provided by trial counsel go to
    the heart of his responsibilities as counsel. They compel the conclusion that
    the appellant did not receive the effective assistance of counsel. The appellant’s
    guilty pleas to the remaining charges must also be struck.</p>
  <p class=Heading>CONCLUSION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the interests of justice, all of the pleas must be set aside. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
