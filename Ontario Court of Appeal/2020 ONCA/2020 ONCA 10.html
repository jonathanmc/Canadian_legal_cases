  <p><strong>Thorburn J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants, Teshome Aga, Yoseph Beyene, Dereje
    Goshu, Tseduke Gezaw, and Belay Hebest (“the appellants”), are five former
    members of the congregation of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Canada
    St. Mary Cathedral (the “Congregation). The appellants were expelled from the Congregation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants claim they were given no
    particulars of the allegations against them leading to their expulsion, no
    opportunity to respond to the allegations, and no opportunity to make
    representations in respect of their expulsion. They claim this was in breach of
    the rules governing the Congregation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants therefore brought an action
    against the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church of Canada St. Mary Cathedral, which
    is incorporated under the <em>Corporations Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.38 (the
    “Church”), as well as members of its leadership, including Messale Engeda</span><a

-.25pt'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=EN-US>, Abune Dimetros,
    and Hiwot Bekele (together referred to as “the respondents”). The appellants
    claim, “The Church failed to follow their own internal procedures” in deciding
    to expel them from the Congregation and their right to natural justice and
    freedom to practice their religion as set out in s. 2(a) of the </span><em><span
style='line-height:100%'>Charter</span></em> <span lang=EN-US>was violated in
    expelling them from the Congregation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In their Further Amended Statement of Defence,
    the respondents pleaded,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he Church is a voluntary association, the members of which
    acquire no civil or property rights by virtue of becoming members. Accordingly,
    [the appellants] had no freestanding right to procedural fairness with respect
    to the manner in which they were expelled from membership, and the decisions to
    expel are not subject to review by a court of law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents brought a motion for summary
    judgment claiming there is no genuine issue requiring a trial and there are no
    rights to be enforced, as there is no underlying contract or other civil right.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge held there was no underlying
    contract and therefore no justiciable issue in respect of the claim that the respondents
    failed to follow internal church procedures in expelling them. She therefore
    granted the motion for summary judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants claim the motion judge erred in
    granting the motion for summary judgment, as the Constitution and By-Laws have
    provisions governing disciplinary measures that are contractually binding and
    enforceable, and there is therefore a justiciable issue to be tried.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal and set aside the dismissal of the claim.</span></p>

    Cathedral is a corporation without share capital, incorporated under Part III
    of the <em>Corporations Act</em>. Its objects include a provision, “To solicit
    and receive donations, bequests, legacies and grants and to enter into
    agreements, contracts and undertakings incidental thereto.”</span></p>

    numbers are different.</span></p>

    at parish church”. Similarly, Article 63 of the Revised Constitution
    corresponds to Article 54 of the Constitution, both of which deal with “Verdict

    subject to rights and obligations in contract upon becoming members of the
    Congregation. Those rights and obligations are set out in the Constitution and
    By-Laws. However, it is not clear whether, and if so, how those rights were
    breached, as the respondents have failed to provide all of the information in
    respect of the rules and the steps taken by the respondents leading to
    expulsion.</span></p>

    result, I would reverse the costs below.</span></p>

    2017, the “Patriarch of Ethiopia”, Abba Merkorios, sent a letter to the leadership
    of St. Mary Cathedral. In this letter, the Patriarch of Ethiopia confirmed that
    Archbishop Dimetros’ decision with respect to his response to the investigation
    report was just. It says if anyone disdains the archbishop’s directives, they
    will be “grouped with the gentiles”. However, this letter is not specific to
    the expulsion of the appellants. In addition, they were not “grouped with
    gentiles” – they were expelled only from St. Mary Cathedral.</p>
