    Justice Michael Block of the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is an appeal from conviction for sexual assault. The events
    occurred in a high school math class. The complainant testified that the
    appellant took her phone and so she took his hat. A chase ensued, ending at the
    back of the classroom where the complainant said that the appellant stood
    behind her, wrapped his arms around her, and touched her vaginal area for what
    felt like a minute. She was in a crouched position when the touching took
    place.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There were two other witnesses to the alleged events. They described
    what they saw somewhat differently than the complainant. Another student said
    that she saw the complainant on the floor at the back of the classroom, with
    the appellant off to her side, touching her stomach with one hand, and her
    vaginal area with the other. The teacher also testified, recounting what she
    saw. The teacher said that the complainant looked like she was kneeling on the
    ground with the appellant behind her, reaching around to her front in what
    appeared to be a bear hug. Their backs were to the teacher and so she could not
    see what the appellant was doing with his hands. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by finding that the
    witnesses accounts corroborated the complainants account without first satisfactorily
    resolving the differences in the three witnesses evidence about what they
    observed. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was under no obligation to recount the minute details of
    each witness evidence. Nor was he required to resolve every inconsistency in
    that evidence. He recounted the important aspects of their evidence, as
    reviewed above, and concluded that there were no significant contradictions
    in the evidence given by them. This was a conclusion that was available on the
    evidence. While the complainant described the entire incident as she
    experienced it, the other witnesses were describing only the parts of the
    incident that they witnessed from different vantage points within the
    classroom. The discrepancies in the evidence can be understood as a natural
    consequence of the fact that the witnesses were positioned differently within
    the classroom and did not see the same parts of the event. Accordingly, we do
    not accept the suggestion that the trial judge erred in concluding that the
    evidence of the other student and teacher corroborated the complainants
    account. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also suggests that the trial judge erred by failing to
    consider that the complainant gave contradictory accounts relating to how many
    times the appellant inappropriately touched her in the classroom over a period
    of time leading up to and culminating in the event at the back of the
    classroom. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant told the police that the touching had occurred more
    frequently than she testified to at trial. The trial judge confronted this
    inconsistency, finding that it was not a serious discrepancy. In arriving at
    this conclusion, the trial judge took into account the complainants age and
    apparent immaturity, as well as the over one-year lapse in time between the
    incidents and trial. The trial judge concluded that, in light of these
    circumstances, it did not surprise him that the complainant did not have a
    perfect recall of the precise number of incidents that were involved. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no error in this reasoning. It was open to the trial judge to
    make observations about the complainants level of maturity as she presented in
    the witness stand. He was in a good position to do so. Moreover, it was open to
    him to apply the common-sense proposition that the passage of time could have
    an impact on her memory as to the number of times she may have been touched by
    the appellant. We would defer to that finding. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also points to an aspect of complainants
    cross-examination that he says so seriously undermines her credibility that it
    required the trial judge to specifically address the issue. The complainant was
    asked whether she disagreed that she had told the police that the appellant had
    touched her on ten prior occasions: Do you disagree that thats what you said
    to the police? The complainant responded with a simple yeah. Crown counsel
    sought immediate clarification as to whether the witness was answering that she
    agreed or disagreed with what had been put to her. While the question was
    clarified, the witness was never asked to clarify her answer. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies upon this passage from the cross-examination to
    suggest that, by denying what was reflected in the transcript of the police
    interview, the trial judge erred by not specifically resolving this obvious
    credibility concern. We do not agree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read in context, the question was at best confusing. It is unclear
    exactly what the complainant was agreeing to when she said yeah. Although it
    would have been preferable to have her answer clarified in re-examination, the
    matter was not so central that it demanded specific attention by the trial
    judge. He was clearly alive to the discrepancies between the complainants statement
    and her trial evidence, specifically as it related to the number of
    inappropriate contacts prior to the date of the alleged offence. As the trial
    judge found, the complainant did not brazenly deny apparent gaps or
    inconsistencies between her evidence and her statement to the police and
    allowed that her memory might well be flawed, especially in respect of contact
    with the defendant prior to October the 31st, 2014. It was open to the trial
    judge to come to this conclusion in light of the record before him. We would
    defer to his conclusions in this regard. </p>

    deal with the suggestion of collusion between the complainant and another
    classmate. As framed at trial, the issue was whether there was active
    fabrication arising from collusion. The appellant seems to have moved away from
    this suggestion on appeal, and now suggests that the trial judge failed to
    consider whether there was an inadvertent tainting of the witness evidence
    arising from the discussions between the complainant and witness. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge dealt with the issue of collusion as framed at trial and
    concluded that there was none. We see no error in his approach. Nor do we
    accede to the submission, as reframed on appeal, that the simple fact that the
    complainant and other witness discussed the matter leads to a necessary
    inference that the other student had a false memory created. There is no
    evidence of this. Indeed, the differences between the complainants and other
    students evidence suggests there was no explicit or implicit collusion. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant further suggests that the trial judge ignored the
    complainants animus toward the appellant which he says gave rise to a motive
    to lie about the alleged event. The trial judge specifically adverted to the
    suggestion of animus and rejected it as a possibility. As he stated:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I do not think that [the complainant] had any animus towards
    [the appellant]. It was plain that she found his attentions bothersome, she had
    no particular memory of discord over the volume of her music at the end of
    classI think her evidence was measured, and she took pains not to exaggerate
    the level of interaction with [the appellant], or suggest that he may have some
    powerful attraction to her as a way of explaining his attentions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to the assertion of animus but rejected it. It
    was open to the trial judge to come to this conclusion and we see no basis upon
    which to interfere. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
