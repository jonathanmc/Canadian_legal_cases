  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The applicant Gavin MacMillan and his
    co-accused Enzo De Jesus Carrasco were found guilty, by a jury in a </span>trial<span
class=MsoPageNumber> presided over by Dambrot J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice, of sexually assaulting and administering a noxious substance to a
    young woman in the College Street Bar, owned by the applicant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The applicant’s and co-accused’s
    assault and violation of the complainant took place over approximately six
    hours. A great deal of it was captured by the bar’s surveillance camera. What
    the camera shows is profoundly troubling – substantial violence and nauseating
    degradation over the course of a prolonged physical and sexual assault on the
    complainant. For most of the time, the complainant was unable to resist due to
    severe intoxication by alcohol and cocaine the two men gave her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>On February 12, 2020, the applicant
    received a sentence of nine years’ imprisonment for the offences. He has
    prepared a draft Notice of Appeal. He seeks bail pending the hearing of the
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber>The test for granting bail pending
    appeal is set out in s. 679(3) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
class=MsoPageNumber>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>… the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant
    be released pending the determination of his appeal if the appellant
    establishes that</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not
    frivolous;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with
    the terms of the order; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that the appeal is not frivolous. The applicant’s
    principal ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by determining, as did
    several other Ontario trial judges, that a recent federal law (“Bill C-75”)
    removing peremptory juror challenges applied retrospectively to criminal proceedings
    that had started, but not finished, before Bill C-75 came into force. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This argument is far removed from being frivolous. Indeed, it is almost
    the opposite; it is almost certain to succeed. That is because two months after
    this trial concluded, this court reached the opposite conclusion on the same
    issue. In <em>R. v. Chouhan</em>, 2020 ONCA 40, Watt J.A. said, at paras. 5 and
    217:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>With respect to the
    temporal application of the amendments, I</span></em> decide that the abolition
    of the peremptory challenge applies prospectively, that is to say, only to
    cases where the accused’s right to a trial by judge and jury vested on or after
    September 19, 2019. But I conclude the amendment making the presiding judge the
    trier of all challenges for cause applies retrospectively, that is to say, to
    all cases tried on or after September 19, 2019.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he abolition of peremptory challenges affected the
    substantive rights of the appellant, thus it should not have applied to the
    selection of the jury in his case <em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>nor
    should it apply to the selection of the jury in other cases if the accused had
    a vested right before September 19, 2019 to a trial by judge and jury as it
    existed in the prior legislation</span></u></em><span class=Underline>.</span> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In terms of the relevant temporal factors, the present case is identical
    to <em>Chouhan</em>. It follows that, barring something unforeseen arising, the
    appeal in this case will almost certainly be allowed and a new trial will be
    ordered. Accordingly, this factor counts strongly in the applicant’s favour. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also concedes that the second factor in s. 679(3) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> is not in play on this appeal. The Crown says: “It appears that any
    risk that the Applicant will flee the jurisdiction can be controlled pending
    appeal by the imposition of strict bail conditions”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree. The applicant complied with his bail conditions throughout the
    pre-trial and trial period. Moreover, he has agreed with the Crown that
    stringent bail conditions are appropriate. One of the bail conditions will be
    virtual house arrest:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5. You must reside
    with your surety [mother] at […]</p>
  <p class=CQuote>6. You must
    remain in your residence at all times except: </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>i. for medical emergencies involving you or a member of your
    immediate family (spouse, child, parent, sibling); or</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>ii. for purposes of travelling
    directly to, from and while at court appearances, or meeting with your lawyer,
    or for purposes of complying with this or any other order.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    these factors into account, it is highly unlikely that the applicant is a
    flight risk.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the third factor, the question for determination is whether the applicant
    has shown, on a balance of probabilities, that his detention is not necessary
    in the public interest: see <em>R. v. Oland</em>, 2017 SCC 17, at para. 19; <em>R.
    v. Iraheta</em>, 2018 ONCA 229, at para. 4.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ‘public interest’ factor in s. 679(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> has two
    components – public safety and public confidence in the administration of
    justice: see <em>Oland</em>, at para. 23, and <em>R. v. Farinacci</em> (1993),
    86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 41-43. While public confidence in the
    administration of justice is rarely a central factor in the test, it ought to
    be considered when an offence is serious: <em>Oland</em>, at paras. 29 and 43.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    public confidence in the administration of justice factor is in play in this
    application. Public confidence requires a balancing of reviewability and
    enforceability. In determining whether public confidence requires detention,
    the relevant factors are: (1) the gravity of the offence; (2) the circumstances
    surrounding its commission; (3) the potential for a lengthy term of
    imprisonment; and (4) the strength of the appeal: see <em>Oland</em>, at paras.
    37-40.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offences are grave. The applicant has been convicted of two serious offences –
    sexual assault and administering a noxious substance.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence are, in a word,
    appalling. The applicant’s treatment of the complainant – captured on camera –
    was violent, degrading and prolonged.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment is obvious – the applicant has
    been sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    and unusually on an application for bail, the applicant’s proposed appeal is
    beyond strong; it borders on certainty. On the issue of the jury selection
    process, the applicant’s case is identical to <em>Chouhan</em>. The jury
    selection process in the applicant’s trial was, therefore, defective. His
    appeal will likely be allowed and a new trial will likely be ordered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent disagrees, submitting that it is not almost certain that the
    applicant’s appeal will be allowed. The respondent makes two submissions in
    support of this position.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the respondent informed the court at the bail hearing that it has decided to
    seek leave to appeal <em>Chouhan</em>. The respondent submits that, because of
    the importance of <em>Chouhan</em> in the Ontario justice system (the <em>Chouhan</em> formula was followed in many trials), the Supreme Court is likely to grant
    leave. Then, the respondent submits, the Supreme Court might allow the appeal,
    rendering the applicant’s principal ground of appeal meritless.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem with this submission is that it is entirely speculative. On the ground
    now, <em>Chouhan</em> is the law in Ontario. It will be applied in this appeal.
    Almost certainly, that will mean a new trial in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the respondent submits that even if a ‘<em>Chouhan</em> error’ is established
    in this case, a new trial will not necessarily be the remedy. In a similar
    Ontario case, <em>R. v. Esseghaier and Jaser</em>, 2019 ONCA 672, where this
    court ordered a new trial because of a fault in the jury selection process, the
    federal Crown is seeking leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada and, if
    leave is granted, will argue that the curative proviso in s. 686 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> should be applied to save the trial result. The respondent contends
    that, if this becomes the result in <em>Esseghaier and Jaser</em>, then a
    similar result would likely follow in this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    submission suffers from the same defect as the previous one: it is entirely
    speculative. On the ground now, <em>Esseghaier and Jaser</em> is the law in
    Ontario. And in <em>Esseghaier and Jaser</em>, Zarnett J.A., speaking for a
    unanimous court, said, at para. 95:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In my view, the curative proviso cannot be applied in this
    case. As pointed out in <em>Noureddine</em>, beyond the issue of the curative
    proviso’s application to a question that affects the proper constitution of the
    jury, and thus of the court which tried the appellants, the curative proviso
    cannot be applied unless there was no prejudice to the accused. As in <em>Noureddine</em>,
    the question here is not actual prejudice, which in these kinds of
    circumstances is impossible to gauge, but prejudice to the due administration
    of justice flowing from the denial of a jury selection method which was in law
    properly invoked: <em>Noureddine</em>, at paras. 62-64.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    these factors together, I cannot say public confidence in the administration of
    justice would be offended if the applicant were released on bail pending his
    appeal. He has a very strong case on the appeal. He complied with all the
    conditions of his bail before and during his trial. And as stated above, the
    public confidence factor does not exhaust the public interest: the stringent
    conditions on the applicant’s interim release are adequate to protect public
    safety. In my view, these are the controlling factors on this application,
    against the backdrop of this court’s decisions in <em>Chouhan</em> and <em>Esseghaier
    and Jaser</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the application for bail pending appeal is granted. The Crown
    and the applicant have agreed on the terms of bail, including virtual house
    arrest. Order to go in terms of the draft Release Order filed. </p>
