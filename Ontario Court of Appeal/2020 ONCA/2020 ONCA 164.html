  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is an appeal by 2049390 Ontario Inc. (“the
    appellant”) from the trial judge’s dismissal of a claim for negligence and
    breach of contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is the owner of a commercial
    property located at 369 Queen Street West (“the property”). The property was
    destroyed by fire in 2012.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>James Kan owns and operates the appellant
    company.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s insurer refused to cover the cost
    of rebuilding the property because it was underinsured. Instead, the insurer opted
    to pay out the value of the building limit under the policy. It also charged a
    co-insurance penalty because the property was underinsured by more than 10% of
    its value.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant sued its insurance brokers Pacific
    Insurance Broker Inc. and one of Pacific’s licensed insurance brokers, Doris
    Leung (together “the respondents”), alleging that they had failed to secure
    adequate reconstruction cost insurance for the building and were liable for their
    ensuing losses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The appellant claims the respondents were thereby
    negligent and/or breached their contract with the appellant. The respondents
    defended on the basis that they met their duty of care and contractual
    obligations to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the action. On appeal,
    the appellant claims the trial judge erred by:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>“refusing to enforce the [respondents’] promise
    to provide adequate coverage”;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>“excusing the [respondents] for having given an
    estimate of building costs they were unqualified to give”; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>“relieving Leung of admissions that she did not
    qualify her advice.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant further claims that the trial
    judge adopted a flawed approach to causation and damages. Finally, the
    appellant claims that the trial judge’s reasons gave rise to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, the appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE EVIDENCE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk33026430"><span lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Until 2009, the property was insured through ING
    Insurance. In 2006, the property had a policy building limit of $484,531. In
    2008, it was insured with<b> </b>a building limit of $550,000. The building
    limit increased to $924,000 after the appellant refinanced the property.</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In January 2009, ING Insurance issued a policy
    with a building limit of $984,060. The appellant did not renew the policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Instead, the appellant contacted the respondent
    brokers to find a new insurer. The trial judge found that there was a sense of
    urgency in securing the insurance. Kan contacted Leung on January 20, 2009 by
    late night email and indicated that the policy was going to expire in February
    2009. Several email exchanges between Kan and Leung also note the urgency to
    secure insurance for the property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Leung asked Kan for the property’s current
    insurance policy. Kan provided her with the original 2008 policy with a
    building limit of $550,000 but did not provide her with the revised 2008 policy
    in the amount of $924,000 or the 2009 quote for renewal in the amount of $984,060.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents provided the appellant with a
    quote from The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company (“Dominion”) with a
    building limit of $850,000 for 2009, to increase each year thereafter. The
    appellant purchased the insurance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found as a fact that, for the
    following reasons, Kan, the appellant’s principal, was a sophisticated client
    who was “in a good position to assess whether his insurance coverage was
    sufficient”:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Kan was a real estate agent and mortgage broker
    and supervised renovations to the building;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On two occasions, Kan requested an increase in
    coverage to reflect work done on the property after purchasing the Dominion
    policy; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Kan was aware that the appellant’s building
    limit increased to $924,000 in 2008 under the appellant’s previous ING insurance
    policy but did not disclose it to the respondents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted Leung’s evidence that when she prepared the insurance quote,
    she told the appellant that she used a “rule of thumb” of $200 per square foot to
    arrive at the $850,000 estimate. The trial judge also accepted Leung’s evidence
    that, when they met in person on January 29, 2009, Leung advised Kan:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>… about the need to insure the full
    value of the property to avoid a penalty … [S]he also told Mr. Kan that the [respondents]
    were not cost consultant professionals and that he should consult a cost
    consultant or professional appraiser to get an <span lang=EN-CA>accurate</span> estimate of the cost of rebuilding the property.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>After their meeting, Leung sent a letter to the appellant on
    February 23, 2009 which included the following warning: “[I]f you have not
    insured your property up to the amount of insurance required, you may become a
    CO-INSURER”. She also enclosed with the letter a “Guide to Co-insurance” which
    reiterated the importance of obtaining an accurate appraisal of the property’s
    value: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A regular and careful review of the value of
    your insured property is essential if Co-Insurance penalties are to be avoided.
    We recommend your insurable values be frequently reviewed by a competent,
    independent appraisal company.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Leung testified that she had similar conversations with Kan each
    time the 2009 policy was renewed and that she would have provided him with
    documents advising him to review the value of his property upon renewal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>In her testimony at trial, Leung elaborated on the advice that she
    gave the appellant and her reasons for the advice that she gave:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We are not
    contractors, we are not involving in constructions, I don’t know. I’m providing
    a coverage like against fire, against water damages … The limit we are – we would
    not be able to appraise the building limit on the client’s behalf [<em>sic</em>].</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The number as I
    explained to him is an estimate to get the quote going. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I explain[ed] to
    him. It’s an estimate then if he’s not doing anything, then I would not be
    responsible. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The figure we provided,
    and I told him that this is the limit that you’ve got to use for rebuilding,
    replacing, repair[ing] your building in case of a total loss. So, this number …
    you must make sure is adequate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA> The appellant itself read into evidence as part of its case the
    following excerpt from Leung’s examination for discovery in which she stated
    that she cautioned the appellant that the figure provided was only an estimate:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q: Okay. So you need to understand what the
    client was looking for, and you told us about that, and then you obtained
    information about the property. Okay. And were there any further services that
    you understood that you were supposed to provide as an insurance broker?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A: <u>We would give the, the quote, but always
    caution them [that this] is based on the information they supplied, and you
    convey the same message to the insurance company, so we are not professionals,
    in terms of the building limits and the upgrades to the building … In all
    fairness, I would say that this is only an estimate. Whether or not it is
    adequate, you need a cost consultant or professional engineer to determine the
    limit to rebuild or replace the building</u>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q: And you told him that.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A: Yes. [Emphasis
    added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This information was given to the appellant
    before it purchased the policy. Knowing the limitations of the insurance quote,
    the appellant chose not to seek expert advice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A fire destroyed the property in 2012. Dominion
    paid out the policy limit of $1,438,358, which included the building loss and
    other claims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The property was underinsured and has not been

    subject of what advice, if any, an insurance broker should provide to a client
    in respect of replacement costs. As reflected in the trial judge’s summary of
    his evidence at para. 36, he testified that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>the standard of
    practice requires insurance brokers to advise clients about the importance of
    having coverage that protects the full value of their property, to advise that
    they are not qualified to provide advice on the value of property and to
    recommend that clients retain the services of a reconstruction cost consultant
    in order to obtain an accurate estimate of the costs of reconstruction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the respondents’ expert, Frank Szirt,
    opined in his report</span><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:
200%'> </span><span lang=EN-CA>that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is an accepted tenet in the insurance
    industry that the responsibility for determining the limits which accurately
    reflect the values exposed to risks fall on the insured. This is because the
    special knowledge necessary to determine insurable values resides in the
    insured, it is the insured who is in the best position to choose the limit(s)
    which provides adequate protection. And, since the adverse financial
    consequences arising from the underinsured property will be borne by the
    insured, this is a non-transferrable responsibility.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The responsibility of brokers is confined to
    arranging insurance coverage the scope of which, within market availability,
    fully respond to the needs of their clients. This is the function they are qualified
    for by their training, licensing requirements and mandatory continuing
    education.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Concerning real property, brokers are
    untrained in property appraisal and thus lack the requisite expertise to assess
    their clients' values at risk. Similarly, brokers cannot provide any meaningful
    advice about their clients' appropriate business interruption limit, given that
    it is based on financial information to which the insured, and not the
    insurance broker, is privy. Consequently, if insureds require assistance in
    determining the appropriate limits, they must seek it from professional
    appraisers for real property and their accountants for business interruption.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In short, the
    proper role of brokers is to explain to their clients the need for insurance to
    full value. In terms of their involvement in establishing policy limits, the
    fail-safe recommendation is to obtain professional advice – appraisal for
    property and accounting for business interruption.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A party alleging bias has a “high burden” to
    meet given the “strong presumption of judicial impartiality”: <em>Yukon

    SCC 25, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282<em>, </em>at paras. 25-26. For this court to

    deliver reasons quickly and avoid addressing the complicated evidence
    concerning damages. In essence, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    delivered reasons that do not reflect her genuine assessment of the evidence
    and the issues but were instead produced as an expedient was to dispose of the

    trial judge provided four pages of analysis on damages, in her 111-paragraph

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She did not quantify the replacement cost, both because she found

    done so even if she had found that it was entitled to damages. Rather, she
    indicated that she would have referred this issue to a Master pursuant to r.&nbsp;54.02

    their duty of care and or contractual obligations to the appellant, the trial
    judge noted that a party is not entitled to replacement cost damages where
    there is no evidence it would have diligently replaced the building with a
    building of like kind and quality: <em>Carter v. Intact Insurance Company</em>,

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There was no

    on whether damages were owing in the first place: <em>Tkachuk Farms Ltd. v.

    Motives</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    “revers[ed]” the motives of the respondents and the appellant insured, which
    gave an appearance of bias. The appellant claims the”<span
class=MsoCommentReference><span style='line-height:200%'> straw-man argument
    regarding “accurate” versus “rough” insurance limit estimates was compounded by
    the <u>role reversal</u> of Kan as motivated by cost to underinsure and Leung
    as the victim of Kan’s stratagem.” </span></span>The appellant argues that it
    was the broker, Leung, who wanted to lower the limits rather than the appellant
    who sought to reduce insurance costs. To make this point, the appellant cited
    excerpts from trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    erred by finding that the appellant cancelled his policy with his previous
    insurer because the premiums were too high.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits this could not be true because
    ING never sent the policy renewal to him. In support of his submission, the
    appellant cites the following passage from the cross-examination of James Hui,
    the appellant’s previous broker:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q: I appreciate that the file shows that you
    received the cancellation from Mr. Pa through Pacific, but the file does not
    show that you actually sent the 2009 policy to the [appellant].</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A: Okay, the file show – but um, if the client
    did not receive the renewal policy, he would not be able to discuss with me about
    a premium, because the I think he received the premium, the renewal premium.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q: I’m going to suggest to you that if he
    didn’t receive the policy, then he couldn’t have reviewed the policy with you.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A: Yes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, Hui also testified that:</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
lang=EN-CA>A: The cancellation [was] from Mr. Pa [who managed the insurance on
    the property at the time], but I think I at some point I did or maybe I have –
    I did talk to Mr. Kan through email or phone call and he asked us to cancel the
    policy.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span
lang=EN-CA>Q: And the reason given? …</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA>A: Premium.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As held by the trial judge, this excerpt from
    the cross-examination confirms that, whether or not the written policy was
    delivered to Kan, either Kan or his agent informed Hui that the premiums were
    the reason for the decision not to renew.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Secondly, the appellant suggests that it was
    Leung who wanted to underinsure the property, not the appellant. The appellant cites
    the following excerpt from the evidence of one of Leung’s superiors, who
    testified that Leung was concerned that the figure quoted was too high:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q: Okay, do you remember speaking with her
    and being advised that the client was reluctant to increase the coverage from $550,000?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A: I can freely
    recall that she was worried about the premium because the figure is way higher.
    I said, “Well either you do it or you don’t because you’ve got to do, make sure
    it’s properly insured.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Leung was worried that this premium was much
    higher than the last insurance quote she was aware of (as provided to her by
    Kan), which was based on a building limit of $550,000. Leung was not provided
    with the 2008 revised policy which had a building limit of $924,000 and was not
    aware that there was a quote in 2009 based on a value of $984,060.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This excerpt does not suggest a desire to
    underinsure but simply a concern that the quote being provided was much higher
    than the quote given to the appellant in the past.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The [appellant]

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This evidence supports the trial judge’s
