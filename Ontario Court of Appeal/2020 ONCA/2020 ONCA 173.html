  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fermar Paving Limited (“Fermar”) is an Ontario
    road builder. On July 29, 2010, Fermar entered into a construction contract
    with the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (“MTO”) to provide road construction
    on a portion of Highway 26 in Simcoe County (the “Project”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To complete the Project, Fermar required two
    types of aggregate: granular “A” and granular “B”. The aggregate was required
    to meet the Ministry’s specifications.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rocco Buono, the principal of 567723 Ontario
    Limited, operating as Winter’s Pit (“Winter’s Pit”), approached Fermar to
    discuss Fermar’s needs for aggregate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After some discussion, Fermar sent a document
    (“the Document”) to Winter’s Pit setting out the proposed terms of an
    agreement. Winter’s Pit requested a higher price for the granular A and
    granular B but asked for no other changes. The Document was signed by both
    parties on September 3, 2010.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A few days later, through its solicitor,
    Winter’s Pit said that it could not provide as much aggregate as it was
    required to in accordance with the signed Document. There were discussions over
    several months, but no new signed agreement was reached.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In November 2010, Fermar was told to leave the
    site or Winter’s Pit would commence proceedings for trespass.</span></p>

    by repudiation of the agreement and sought damages to compensate Fermar for the
    cost of having to source the aggregate from elsewhere.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Document was an enforceable agreement;</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Winter’s Pit appeals from the trial judge’s
    decision. The appeal is allowed on the basis that the trial judge erred in her

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>WINTER’S PIT’S ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Winter’s Pit claims that the trial judge made
    palpable and overriding errors of fact and mixed fact and law in finding the
    Document was an enforceable contract and in awarding damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Winter’s Pit submits that there was no binding
    contract: the Document was only an agreement in principle. Moreover, the
    Document was void as Fermar knew it was illegal for Winter’s Pit to extract
    more than 100,000 tonnes of aggregate per year, since the extraction licence
    was attached. Winter’s Pit also argues that the terms of the Document are
    unclear. Because the Document was drafted by Fermar, the rule of <em>contra
    proferentum</em> applies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Winter’s Pit denies that it repudiated any
    contract with Fermar.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Winter’s Pit argues that Fermar is not entitled
    to damages because Winter’s Pit did not breach any contract. Alternatively,
    Winter’s Pit argues that Fermar failed to adduce cogent evidence to support its
    claim for damages or its efforts to mitigate its damages.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE’S DECISION AND
    CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Liability of Winter’s Pit for Repudiation of the Agreement</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, we see no error in
    the trial judge’s conclusion that there was a valid agreement between Fermar
    and Winter’s Pit and that Winter’s Pit repudiated that agreement:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fermar provided Winter’s Pit with a draft
    agreement on September 2, 2010. After Fermar visited the site, engaged in
    testing, and revised the terms at Winter’s Pit’s request, Winter’s Pit signed
    the draft agreement on September 3.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Document provides that “<u>Winters Pit
    warrants and represents</u> that a minimum of 335,000 tonnes of granular ‘B’
    material is available to F.P.L.” and that “F.P.L. shall have the right to
    manufacture a minimum of 140,000 tonnes of granular ‘A’” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The terms of the two-page agreement were clear
    and unambiguous.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The agreement was not rendered void because
    Winter’s Pit’s licence did not permit it to extract the quantities of granular
    A and B stipulated in the agreement. An increase in the licenced quantities was
    necessary. It was incumbent on Winter’s Pit to revise the terms of agreement
    before signing. It failed to do so at its peril.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 7, 2010, counsel for Winter’s Pit
    wrote to the Senior Operations manager of Fermar to advise that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We have been consulted in connection with a
    September 1, 2010 agreement between 567723 Ontario Limited and Fermar Paving
    Limited. <u>Prior to signing the agreement</u>, our client did not note the
    quantity requirements of the agreement. O<u>ur client cannot comply with the
    agreement and is not prepared to fulfil its obligations under the agreement</u> … [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>f)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 15, counsel for Fermar wrote to
    Winter’s Pit to reiterate that an agreement had been reached and that Winter’s
    Pit was now seeking to “resile from the agreement”. He stated that Fermar was
    prepared “on a completely without prejudice basis to engage in further
    discussions”.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>g)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Winter’s Pit obtained no extension or temporary
    increase to the tonnage of aggregates that could be extracted from Winter’s
    Pit.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>h)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fermar tried to resolve its differences with
    Winter’s Pit while maintaining its position that the September 3 Document was
    an enforceable contract. None of Fermar’s overtures as per Fermar’s letters of
    October 22 and November 11, were accepted by Winter’s Pit.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When Fermar put its equipment on the property in
    November 2019, Fermar was told to leave the property, failing which Winter’s
    Pit would sue Fermar for trespass. At no time thereafter did Winter’s Pit
    invite Fermar back or indicate that Winter’s Pit was ready, willing, and able
    to meet the terms of the agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal in respect of liability is therefore
    dismissed.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Damages</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fermar sourced its aggregate elsewhere and sued
    Winter’s Pit for breach of contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge correctly held that as a result
    of Winter’s Pit’s repudiation of the agreement, Fermar was entitled to be
    restored to the position that it would have been in had Winter’s Pit met its
    obligation to supply all necessary aggregate. Fermar was required to find other
    sources of aggregate and incurred costs for equipment rental, cost of the
    aggregate, transportation, labour and other valid expenses. Fermar had an
    obligation to mitigate its losses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge awarded Fermar damages in the
    amount of $816,436.37, which she found to be the difference between what Fermar
    would have paid to Winter’s Pit and the amount it did pay to the third-party
    suppliers for the aggregate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In so doing, the trial judge relied on only two
    documents. The first was a document entitled, “Cost Summary for Alternate
    Sourcing of Granular “A” and Granular “B” by Supplier”, which purported to
    summarize approximately 1000 pages of invoices and other documents. The second
    was a document entitled, “Production Cost Analysis”, which compared the costs
    that Fermar says it would have paid to Winter’s Pit and the costs it paid to
    third parties for the aggregate. These documents were adduced at trial through
    Charles Ezomo, Fermar’s project manager.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge noted that Mr. Ezomo was
    responsible for planning all assigned projects, preparing contracts, progress
    certificates, payments and completion of the projects. He oversaw the
    completion of this project and obtained alternate sources of aggregate. Mr.
    Ezomo testified that Fermar obtained the requisite Granular A from Brock Pit
    and Granular B, as well as some additional Granular A, from Walker’s Pit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Ezomo testified that he had to approve all
    invoices used in the analysis when they were originally received and did not
    review them again for purposes of preparing the summary. Mr. Ezomo is not an
    accountant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Ezomo did not do an independent analysis but
    prepared the cost summary based on a report generated by Fermar’s accounting
    department. It is not clear who prepared the accounting report. None of the
    source documents were produced at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the two summaries were included in a
    Joint Book of Documents, there appears to have been no agreement that the
