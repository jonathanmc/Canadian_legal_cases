  <p style='text-align:justify'>On appeal from the conviction
    entered on July 18, 2017 by the Honourable Stephen J. Hunter of the Ontario Court
    of Justice. </p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was charged with a single count of sexual assault contrary
    to s. 271 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. It was alleged
    that he sexually assaulted the victim while she was unconscious as a result of
    consuming too much alcohol at a cottage party.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant elected to be tried by a judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice, sitting without a jury. He requested a preliminary inquiry. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The victim testified at the preliminary inquiry, as did her friend
    (whose parents owned the cottage where the party was held). Both witnesses were
    cross-examined. There were other witnesses scheduled to testify. However, the
    preliminary inquiry judge invited counsel to meet with him in chambers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon the resumption of the proceedings, trial counsel said: “I have
    instructions to at this point in the preliminary hearing to approach the Court
    with respect to making a re-election….” The preliminary inquiry judge (who then
    became the trial judge) noted the re-election to be tried in the Ontario Court
    of Justice, which he endorsed on the information. The trial judge asked trial counsel
    whether he would be calling any evidence. He said that he would not. The Crown
    then asked the trial judge to make a finding of guilt based on the evidence
    that was heard. Trial counsel made no objection. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found the appellant guilty of sexual assault. In brief
    reasons, he said that was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    intercourse had occurred; however, he was satisfied that the appellant touched
    the victim in a sexual manner without her consent. The case was adjourned for
    sentencing. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within roughly two months, the appellant appeared before the trial judge
    with new counsel. He moved to re-open the proceedings with a view to reversing
    his re-election. He argued that, because the mandatory requirement of s. 561(7)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em> had not been complied with, the re-election was
    invalid. The Crown took the position that the trial judge was <em>functus
    officio</em> and, therefore, could not re-open the proceedings for the purpose of
    entertaining an application for a further re-election.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge expressed concerns about whether he was <em>functus
    officio</em>. However, acting on the assumption that he was not, the trial
    judge concluded that the appellant’s previous re-election was valid. He said:
    “in my view, the procedure that was conducted before the Court was fair to Mr.
    Mitchell, was fully informed to Mr. Mitchell, he had an election to – he gave –
    instructions to re-elect and proceed with the trial with the full knowledge of
    the process that would unfold after that election was made.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentencing proceedings were adjourned to facilitate the preparation of a
    pre-sentence report. The trial judge acceded to a joint submission of 12
    months’ imprisonment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred both in concluding that
    he was <em>functus officio</em>, and in his alternative finding that the
    appellant waived his right to the reading of the re-election in s. 561(7). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Crown concedes that the trial judge was not <em>functus
    officio</em> but submits that the re-election was valid. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that the trial judge was not <em>functus officio</em> when trial
    counsel applied to re-open the proceedings to make a further re-election. Until
    sentence is imposed, a trial judge has jurisdiction to re-open the proceedings: <em>R. v. Griffith</em>, 2013 ONCA 510, 116 O.R. (3d) 561; <em>R. v. Lessard</em> (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 70 (Ont. C.A.); and <em>R. v. Kippax</em>, 2011 ONCA
    766, 286 O.A.C. 144. The trial judge could have re-opened the case to deal with
    the re-election request had he seen fit to do so. However, we agree with the
    trial judge’s assessment of the merits of the appellant’s request. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 561(7) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> requires that the following
    words or words to like effect be read to the accused person: “You have given
    notice of your wish to re-elect the mode of your trial. You now have the option
    to do so. How do you intend to re-elect?” This was not done in this case.
    However, when the appellant re-elected to be tried by a judge of the Ontario
    Court of Justice, he was represented by capable counsel. It is clear from the
    record that, through counsel, he waived his right to have the words of s.
    561(7) read to him. The trial judge was entitled to rely upon counsel’s
    representations as to the instructions he received from the appellant, and to
    conclude that the requirements of s. 561(7) had been waived: <em>Korponay v. Attorney
    General of Canada</em>, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41, at p. 53.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing was placed before us that calls into question the appellant’s
    understanding of the consequences of his re-election. Moreover, there is no
    suggestion that trial counsel was ineffective in his representation of the
    appellant. We are satisfied that the appellant waived his right to the reading
    of the re-election and his re-election was valid. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would have been better if the language of s. 561(7) was read to the
    appellant, as required by that section: see <em>R. v. Mitchell</em> (1997), 36
    O.R. (3d) 643 (C.A.), at pp. 655-656; and <em>R. v. Vuong</em>, 2010 ONCA 798,
    264 C.C.C. (3d) 39, at para. 33. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that there was
    a valid waiver and the appellant was dealt with fairly.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed. </p>
