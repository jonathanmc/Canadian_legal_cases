  <p><strong>Zarnett J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=Heading>OVERVIEW</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Those involved in the construction industry add
    value to real estate by their provision of work and materials. In order to
    protect them against the risk of non-payment and the unjust enrichment of
    others, Ontario enacted the <em>Construction</em> <em>Lien Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.30 (the “CLA”), now the <em>Construction Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30,
    with a comprehensive scheme of liens, holdbacks, and trusts. One situation
    where the need for protection can be most acute is when contractors have
    improved a real estate project, have not been paid, and the owner becomes
    insolvent. Insolvency, however, is a federal matter, with its own processes and
    priorities. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This case concerns the scope and effectiveness
    of s. 9(1) of the CLA<em> </em>in an insolvency proceeding.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Subsection 9(1) of the CLA
    provides for a trust over sale proceeds of property in favour of unpaid
    contractors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Cumberland Group, a residential condominium
    developer, was granted insolvency protection under the <em>Bankruptcy and
    Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “BIA”) and continued under the <em>Companies’
    Creditors</em> <em>Arrangement Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36<em> </em>(the “CCAA”)<em>.</em> It owned unsold condominium units in a project it constructed. The appellants, Toro
    Aluminum (A Partnership), Speedy Electrical Contractors Ltd., and Dolvin Mechanical
    Contractors Ltd., had supplied work and material to these units. They were owed
    significant unpaid sums.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The condominium units were ultimately sold
    during the insolvency proceedings. As a result of the sale, the appellants
    claimed that a trust arose over the proceeds to the extent of the amounts owing
    to them, which would give them an effective priority for these amounts. The motion
    judge rejected the trust claim, reasoning that he was bound to reach that
    conclusion due to the court-appointed Monitor’s involvement in the sale and
    this court’s decision in <em>Re Veltri Metal Products Co</em>. (2005), 48
    C.L.R. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellants obtained leave to appeal the
    motion judge’s decision. This court granted leave and, as the correctness of <em>Veltri </em>was in issue, it also convened a five-judge panel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary, the trust created by s. 9(1) of the CLA
    can be effective in a CCAA sales process. It would only be displaced under the
    doctrine of paramountcy if it conflicted with a specific priority created under
    the CCAA. In this case, nothing displaces the operation of the s. 9(1) trust
    over the proceeds to the extent of the amounts owed to the appellants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not interpret <em>Veltri</em> as standing
    for the proposition that the substantial involvement of the CCAA Monitor in the
    sales process prevents a s. 9(1) trust from arising. <em>Veltri </em>was
    correctly decided on its facts, which were very different from this case. On
    these facts, the s. 9(1) trust arose.</span></p>

    of a residential condominium development municipally located at 2-6 Lisgar
    Street, consisting of two towers and 665 residential units (the “Edge

    beneficial interest in trust for Urbancorp Cumberland 2 L.P.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2011, Triangle began construction on the Edge
    Project and entered into agreements with the appellants to provide labour and
    materials for the project. Between May and July 2015, Triangle sold the vast
    majority of the condominium units.</span></p>

    residential units, parking spots, and storage units to Residential for $2.
    Residential also held these units in trust for Bosvest, and ultimately for
    Urbancorp Cumberland 2 L.P. Given that there was no change in beneficial
    ownership, there is no suggestion here that this transfer affected the rights

    the Sales Process Order, the sales process was continued after the CCAA filing.
    A total of 32 residential units, 5 retail condominium units, 7 parking spots,
    and 4 storage units were sold. For the units registered in Triangle’s name, each
    agreement for the sales stipulated the vendor as “Edge on Triangle Park Inc. as
    represented by the Fuller Landau Group Inc. solely in its capacity as Proposed
    (sic) Trustee of Triangle...” It was implicit in the parties’ positions that a similar

    vested in the purchaser “all of the right, title, and interest of the
    respective Cumberland Group entity (Triangle or Residential, as the case may
    be) together with any beneficial interest of any Cumberland Group entity…” The Approval
    and Vesting Order also provided that the vesting of title in the purchaser
    would be free and clear of certain claims and encumbrances on the units. The
    proceeds of the sales were ordered to stand in the place of the units in order

    by the Monitor in Triangle’s name ($641,553.71) and Residential’s name
    ($5,452,161.46). Funds were deposited into each account depending on which
    entity held registered title to the unit being sold. The Monitor estimated that
    $1,846,751.71 was owing to the mortgagees of the units, whose rights against
    the sale proceeds were preserved. The net proceeds remaining from the sales,

    Relying on <em>Veltri</em>, he found that a s. 9(1) trust could not arise on

    premises, but rather a CCAA Monitor. He stated that “[r]egardless of whether
    one could argue that <em>Veltri</em> does not give sufficient recognition to
    the position of lien claimants, the Court of Appeal has ruled that the
    prerequisites of a ss. 7 or 9 trust are not met where a Monitor ultimately
    receives the proceeds of sale to be held for creditors.” He drew attention to the
    court orders giving the Monitor in this case control over the sales process and
    its proceeds, as well as the limitations placed on the Cumberland Group entities.
    Despite the fact that the debtor in <em>Veltri </em>had no equity in the funds
    realized on the sales, the motion judge did not consider <em>Veltri</em> to be
    distinguishable. Ultimately, he concluded: “[h]ere, the Monitor controlled the

    the Monitor <span class=Underline>as a representative</span>. They note that it
    was Triangle or Residential’s interest in the units that was sold, and that the
    consideration from the sales was “received” by each of them as “owner” since
    the sale proceeds were deposited into bank accounts opened for them. The appellants
    also note, crucially, that the “value of the consideration” exceeded both the

    was wrongly decided. Finally, the appellants submit—supported by the Attorney

    limited than the appellants suggest. They submit that, on these facts, and
    given the various court orders in this insolvency, the motion judge was correct
    not to give effect to the assertion that a s. 9(1) trust arose. Like the motion
    judge, they say that the condominium sales were not made “by the owner” given
    the Monitor’s control over Triangle and Residential’s activities, especially with
    respect to the sales process. They further note that the proceeds of sale were

    receipt of proceeds of a sale of premises that have been improved by a
    contractor’s labour or materials. The question of whether a s. 9(1) trust is
    effective in insolvency can therefore arise in two situations. The first is when
    the sale precedes the insolvency filing, but the proceeds remain in the insolvent’s
    possession when the filing occurs. In that circumstance, the question would be whether
    those funds continue to be held in a trust that will be recognized in the
    insolvency, or whether, upon insolvency, they lose that character and form part
    of the debtor’s assets to be dealt with in the insolvency. The second
    situation, which is the one applicable here, is when the sale that triggers the
    assertion of a s. 9(1) trust takes place after the insolvency filing. </span></p>

    Guarantee Company of North</em> <em>America v. Royal Bank of Canada</em>, 2019
    ONCA 9, 144 O.R. (3d) 225, a decision of a five-judge panel of this court. <em>Guarantee </em>considered the statutory trust created under s. 8(1) of the <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em> in the context of a bankruptcy. Subsection
    8(1) of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em> deems amounts
    owing to or received by the contractor, on account of the contract price of an
    improvement, to constitute a trust fund for the benefit of subcontractors who
    supplied services or materials to the improvement. In <em>Guarantee</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> the contractor became bankrupt. After
    the bankruptcy, its Receiver was paid amounts owing under contracts that the
    contractor had performed. The Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”), as a secured
    creditor of the bankrupt, claimed the amounts received to be part of the assets
    of the bankrupt divisible among its creditors. Subcontractors and employees of
    the contractor, on the other hand, claimed the amounts received to be funds
    held in trust and excluded from the property of the bankrupt. </span></p>

    67(1)(a) of the BIA excludes property held in trust by the bankrupt from
    property of the bankrupt that is divisible among its creditors. However, this
    exception applies only if the trust satisfies the three certainties of general
    trust law. As the Supreme Court of Canada held in <em>British Columbia v.
    Henfrey Samson Belair Ltd.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> [1989] 2 S.C.R. 24, a statutory trust created by a province that does not meet
    the requirements of general trust law is ineffective in bankruptcy as a matter
    of federal paramountcy, but a statutory trust created by provincial legislation
    that does meet those requirements is effective: see <em>Guarantee</em><em><span

    the statutory trust created by s. 8(1) of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em> satisfied the requirements for a trust under general principles of trust
    law—certainty of intention, certainty of object, and certainty of subject
    matter. He found that certainty of intention to create a trust could be found
    in the Legislature’s requirement that the funds be held in trust, regardless of
    the actual intention of the trustee. He also found that, although one effect of
    a s. 8(1) trust is to protect construction contract monies in bankruptcy, s.
    8(1) is not in pith and substance legislation in relation to bankruptcy; the
    priority-creating effects of s. 8(1) are purely incidental to a broader purpose
    of the legislation to “protect the rights and interests of those engaged in the
    construction industry and to avoid the unjust enrichment of those higher up the
    construction pyramid”: <em>Guarantee</em>, at para. 32. The s. 8(1) trust was
    therefore the proper subject-matter of provincial legislation: <em>Guarantee</em>,

    bankrupt) and s. 8(1) of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em> (which created the kind of trust the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>BIA</span></em> contemplated) such that paramountcy would render the provincial trust
    inoperative.  Giving effect to a s. 8(1) trust in a bankruptcy did not conflict
    with or frustrate the purpose of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>BIA</span></em>,
    which was to provide for the distribution of the bankrupt’s remaining assets
    (that is, those existing after giving effect to trusts in favour of other
    persons): <em>Guarantee</em>, at para. 38. As a consequence, a s. 8(1) trust
    was effective in a bankruptcy to preserve assets subject to that trust for its

    its creditors: <em>Guarantee</em>, at para 103. </span></p>

    expenses of the sale and the amount necessary to discharge mortgage
    indebtedness. There is certainty of object: s. 9(1) identifies precisely the
    object of the trust as unpaid contractors who supplied work and material to the
    improvement which was sold. There is also certainty of intention: s. 9(1) deems

  <p class=CQuote>In order to avoid a race to liquidation under the <i>BIA</i>,
    courts will favour an interpretation of the <i>CCAA</i> that affords creditors
    analogous entitlements. Yet this does not mean that courts may read bankruptcy
    priorities into the <i>CCAA</i> at will. Provincial legislation defines the
    priorities to which creditors are entitled until that legislation is ousted by
    Parliament. Parliament did not expressly apply all bankruptcy priorities either
    to <i>CCAA</i> proceedings or to proposals under the <i>BIA</i>. Although the
    creditors of a corporation that is attempting to reorganize may bargain in the
    shadow of their bankruptcy entitlements, those entitlements remain only shadows

    charge ranked in priority to “all other security interests, trusts, liens,

    effective on insolvency. In my view, given this conclusion, nothing prevents the
    trust from arising on a sale which takes place after a <em>CCAA</em> filing has
    occurred. However, as <em>Indalex</em> points out, a statutory trust may not be
    given effect if doing so would conflict with a specific priority in the <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>CCAA</span></em>, or an order giving effect to that
    specific priority, such that paramountcy would require that the trust be
    considered inoperative in whole or part. Before considering whether that
    occurred here, I turn to the question of the decision in <em>Veltri.</em></span></p>

    insolvency proceedings yielded funds that were subject to trusts under ss. 7(1),
    7(2), 7(3) or 9(1) of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em>.
    Several factual components of that case are important:</span></p>

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was in this context that the court in <em>Veltri</em> rejected the trust claims under ss. 7(1), (2) and (3) of the CLA. Subsection
    7(1) creates a trust fund for amounts received by an owner that are to be used
    in the financing of an improvement. There was no evidence in <em>Veltri</em> that any funds advanced were to be used in the financing of any improvement in
    respect of the leasehold interest, so this claim failed: <em>Veltri</em>, at para.
    23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsections 7(2) and (3) create a trust over
    amounts certified as payable to a contractor or unpaid when substantial
    performance has been declared by the court, to the extent such amounts are in
    the owner’s hands or received by the owner. In rejecting those claims, the
    court held that the prerequisites of amounts “in the owner’s hands” or “received
    by the owner” were not met. Writing for the court, Cronk J.A. stated, at paras.
    28-29:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri</span></em><i>’</i>s
    lenders have a general security interest in all or substantially all of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> assets. Paragraph 12 of the Sale
    Order provided that the sale proceeds were to “stand in place and stead” of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> assets without prejudice to any
    claim being advanced against them as could have been advanced against the
    assets.  Thus, the sale proceeds were substituted for <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> assets and are subject to the
    claims of <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> secured
    creditors. It is important to emphasize that the appellants have no claim to <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> assets. Rather, their claims are
    trust claims under the Act in respect of the proceeds of the sale of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> assets. The sale proceeds,
    however, are insufficient to pay the claims of <em><span style='font-style:
normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> secured creditors in full and a significant
    shortfall will result (in excess of $10 million (U.S.) in the case of funds
    owed to Comerica). </p>
  <p class=CQuote>The court-approved sale of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> assets included the sale of <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span> </em>leasehold interest in the
    Lakeshore Plant, the premises upon which the appellants’ work was performed. 
    The asset sale to Ventra could not have taken place in the face of the claims
    of <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> secured creditors
    without the consent of those creditors and court approval, and the sale was
    subject to the terms imposed by the court.  Under these terms, the gross
    proceeds of sale were applied in payment of specific items and, thereafter, the
    net sale proceeds, which stood in substitution for <em><span style='font-style:
normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> fully secured assets, were paid to the Monitor. <u>Thus, <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri</span> </em>had no interest in or
    right to any of the net sale proceeds ultimately paid to and now held by the
    Monitor. At best, <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri</span></em> was a
    conduit for the receipt by the Monitor of the sale proceeds. Accordingly, the
    sale proceeds are not trust monies “in [<em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em>]
    hands” or “received by [<em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri]</span></em> as owner”, as is required to trigger the trust provisions of ss. 7(2) and 7(3)
    of the Act.</u> This distinguishes this case from <em>Structural Contractors
    Ltd. v. Westcola Holdings Inc.</em> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 417 (Ont. C.A.), leave
    to appeal to S.C.C. dismissed, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 460 (S.C.C.) and similar
    cases. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not read these conclusions as turning on
    freestanding considerations of the Monitor having been involved in the sale, or
    the proceeds having been paid to the Monitor. In my view, the operative factors
    were that the sale in question was of assets that extended beyond the leasehold
    interest; that all of the assets sold were subject to the creditors’ security;
    that the assets could not be sold without the creditors’ consent; that the
    court order permitting the sale preserved the ability of those secured
    creditors to claim against the proceeds; and that the secured creditors were
    owed more than the amount received on the sale. Under these circumstances, <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri</span></em><em> </em>“had no interest in or
    right to any of the net sale proceeds”, and its temporary receipt of proceeds
    for the purpose of paying them to the Monitor (who had the responsibility of
    using them to pay the claims of the secured creditors) did not mean that the
    sale proceeds were trust monies in <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri’s</span></em> hands or received by <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri</span></em><em> </em>as owner under ss. 7(2) and (3) of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em>.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am fortified in this conclusion by the way the
    court in <em>Veltri </em>dealt with the s. 9(1) claim. The court rejected that
    claim, noting that there was no showing that <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Veltri</span></em>’s
    leasehold interest had any value and no allocation of any part of the sale
    proceeds to that leasehold interest. Furthermore, and for the same reasons as
    given above, the temporary receipt of funds (in which <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Veltri</span></em><em> </em>had no interest) for the
    purpose of paying them to the Monitor (who would then pay secured creditors
    entitled to them) did not qualify as consideration received by the owner as a
    result of the sale of the leasehold interest: <em>Veltri</em>, at para 35.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Stepping back from the precise language used in <em>Veltri</em>,
    on its facts, no s. 9(1) trust could arise because the amounts received from
    the sale of all the property was less than the amount to discharge the lenders’
    security over them, and no amount was shown to be proceeds of the sale of the
    leasehold interest. A s. 9(1) <em><span style='font-style:normal'>t</span></em>rust
    only arises if the value of the consideration received by the owner from the
    sale of premises, which have been improved by the work or materials of the
    contractor, exceeds the amount of mortgage indebtedness. No trust arises if the
    value of the consideration is zero, or if the mortgage debt is equal to or
    greater than any sale proceeds. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, <em>Veltri</em> does not stand for
    the proposition that the control by a <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CCAA</span></em> Monitor of a sales process, or the receipt by the Monitor of the proceeds of
    sale, without more, prevents a s. 9(1) trust arising when the proceeds of sale
    of the improvement are shown to have a positive value that exceeds the mortgage
    debt on the property. That fact pattern was simply not present in <em>Veltri</em>.</span></p>

    criticized for ignoring the “deemed receipt” rule. Under it, for the purpose of
    determining whether a trust arises pursuant to legislation analogous to the <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em>, the receipt of funds by an assignee
    or other representative of the person required to hold funds in trust is
    treated in the same way as if the person had itself received the funds: see <em>Minneapolis-Honeywell

    W.W.R. 1 (Man. C.A.), the deemed receipt rule was described, at p. 13, when
    considering a statutory trust in favour of subcontractors which arises on
    receipt by the contractor of money properly owing to it under the contract:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A]ny money <i>properly owing</i> to [the contractor] <i>on account of the contract price</i>, and <i>paid</i> to

    part of the law of Ontario. I note that it was implicitly applied in <em>Guarantee</em>,

    the Receiver of the insolvent contractor: <em>Guarantee</em>, at para. 6.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, in my view, the deemed receipt rule has
    nothing to do with the reasoning or result in <em>Veltri</em>. The rule equates
    amounts properly owing to a person and received by the person’s assignee as
    being subject to the trust as if the person had received the funds directly. In <em>Veltri</em>, no amount was properly owing to <em>Veltri</em> from the asset
    sale that was attributable to the leasehold interest or that exceeded the mortgage

  <p class=CQuote>9(1) Where the owner’s interest in a premises is sold by the

    place were sales “by the owner”. The agreements of purchase and sale were made
    by Triangle or Residential as represented by Fuller Landau, solely in its
    capacity as Proposal Trustee/Monitor of Triangle or Residential. That Triangle
    or Residential entered into the agreements through a representative does not
    detract from the fact that it was they who entered into the sale agreements as
    vendors. What was contracted to be sold were units registered in their names,
    that is, premises legally owned by them, and there is no dispute that they were
    effective agreements to convey the beneficial ownership in the premises of the
    other Cumberland Group members.</span></p>

    transferred to the purchasers was all of the right, title and interest of the
    Cumberland Group in the unit. In other words, the sale by the owner was of the
    owner’s interest, notwithstanding that it occurred in an insolvency process.
    This result follows from the CCAA itself, under which sales must be authorized
    by the court, but what is authorized is nevertheless a sale by the debtor: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b>36</b>&nbsp;<b>(1)</b>&nbsp;A
    debtor company in respect of which an order has been made under this Act may
    not sell or otherwise dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business

    approval, including one under federal or provincial law, the court may
    authorize the sale or disposition even if shareholder approval was not
    obtained.</p>

lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unlike <em>Veltri</em>, the value of the
    consideration received on the sale was attributable to the sale of premises to
    which the improvement had been made. The value of the consideration exceeded
    the mortgage debt. And the value of the consideration was received by the
    owner, as it was deposited into bank accounts that had been opened for Triangle
    or Residential in accordance with their registered ownership of the units sold.
    The fact that the accounts into which the proceeds of sale were paid also
    received amounts from other sources does not detract from the certainty of the
    trust, since the amounts subject to the trust were separately accounted for and

    important sense in which the Monitor controlled the sales process and the funds
    received. The orders granted or continued in the <em><span style='font-style:

    to court approval) for the Cumberland Group and specifically gave it the power
    to conduct, supervise and direct the sales process. But neither the <em><span

    officer of the court to monitor the business and affairs of the Cumberland
    Group (at para. 29); and that the Monitor could cause or direct the Cumberland

    to list the units for sale (at para.15) and approved the form of agreements

    owner in respect of making a sale, conveying its interest, or depositing its
    funds. It is simply whether the owner, regardless of who decides for it, had
    made a sale of its interest and received funds that exceeded mortgage
    indebtedness and the expenses of sale. Accordingly, the control the Monitor had
    over the process does not detract from the conclusion that the owner sold its

    inconsistent with the trust obligation since the extent of the trust is the $3,864,428.72

    the amount required to be held in trust is being held.</span></p>

    will take priority over a provincial statutory trust. The DIP Financing Charge
    in this case, as in <em>Indalex</em>, was given priority over “all other security
    interests, trusts, liens, charges and encumbrances, claims of secured
    creditors, statutory or otherwise”. (As noted above, no objection was taken to
    the payments on account of the DIP financing in this case.) But paramountcy
    renders the provincial trust inoperative only to the extent required to deal
    with the conflict, that is, by yielding priority to the DIP Financing Charge.

    net cash proceeds from the sale of the  Vacant Unit with the same priority…as
    if the Vacant Unit had not been sold.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>If this paragraph were read as meaning that, for
    all purposes, no sale of the units took place, it would arguably prevent the
    trust from arising because the trust is dependent on a sale having occurred.
    However, in my view, the Approval and Vesting Order cannot be read that way. This
    paragraph refers to a defined set of “Claims” and “Encumbrances”; the Order
    specifies that the purchaser will take title free and clear of them.
    Encumbrances are listed on Schedule B to the Approval and Vesting Order and are
    specific registered encumbrances. Claims is a broader term, but paragraph 3 of
    the Approval and Vesting Order makes it clear that they are claims that would
    or may otherwise have affected the purchaser or the purchaser’s title to the unit.
    It is those matters that are to be dealt with, as among the holders of the
    Claims and Encumbrances, and to determine their priority, “as if the Vacant
    Unit had not been sold”.</span></p>

    in s. 9(1) of the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>CLA</span></em> is not
    one of the Claims referred to in the Approval and Vesting Order, or one of the Encumbrances
    listed in Schedule B. The trust is not something which would or may have
    affected title to the unit or the purchaser. The trust is not a claim against
    the unit; it does not exist until after there has been a sale and net proceeds.
    The Approval and Vesting Order does not purport to direct that, for <span
class=Underline>all</span> purposes, <span class=Underline>all</span> claims,
    including claims that a trust has arisen against the proceeds of sale when
    received by the vendor, are to be determined as if no sale took place. </span></p>

    Before a determination is made that its provisions become inoperative because
    of a conflict with a federal exercise of power, the federal exercise of power
    is to be interpreted with the goal that both it and the provincial legislation
    operate: <em>Indalex,</em> at para. 57.  Nothing in paragraph 5 of the Approval
    and Vesting Order requires that it be read more broadly than its actual terms,
    nor would doing so be consistent with this interpretive principle. Paragraph 5
    does not prevent the trust from coming into force.</span></p>

    Triangle and Residential, for the benefit of the appellants, pro-rata in
    accordance with the amounts owing to each.</span></p>
