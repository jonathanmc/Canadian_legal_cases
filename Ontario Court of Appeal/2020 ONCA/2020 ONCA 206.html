  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on June 21, 2019 by
    Justice Graham Wakefield of the Ontario Court of Justice, sitting without a
    jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Six passengers of a motor vehicle operated by Mr. Joseph Bradley were
    injured after his motor vehicle sideswiped or was sideswiped by another vehicle
    and Mr. Bradley lost control. Only four of those six occupants were wearing
    seatbelts at the time of the accident. The two young female passengers who were
    sitting, unbuckled, on the laps of other occupants were particularly badly
    injured. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The group had been at a party, as were the occupants of the other motor vehicle
    involved in the accident. Both drivers were prosecuted for six counts of street
    racing causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249.4 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, one count for each of the injured occupants of the
    Bradley vehicle. Only Mr. Bradley was convicted, and only of two counts of the
    included offence of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, s. 249(1), relating to the injuries sustained by the two unbuckled
    occupants.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Mr. Bradley appeals those convictions. The Crown has not cross-appealed the
    acquittals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Bradley pursues three grounds of appeal. First, Mr. Bradley contends
    that the trial judge erred by conflating the <em>actus reus </em>and <em>mens
    rea </em>elements of the offence. Mr. Bradley does not contest that the trial
    judge found that his manner of driving was a marked departure from the norm, thereby
    satisfying the <em>mens rea </em>elements of the dangerous driving offences,
    nor does he appeal this finding. His complaint is that, as a result of the
    conflation that occurred, the trial judge convicted him without ever finding
    that he committed the <em>actus reus </em>by operating his motor vehicle in an
    objectively dangerous manner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree. The trial judge opened his Reasons for Judgment by accurately
    identifying the <em>actus reus </em>issue as “<span class=Underline>whether the
    Crown has proven the manner of driving was dangerous</span> resulting in the
    injuries suffered by each victim” (emphasis added). Although the trial judge
    found that none of the components of Mr. Bradley’s driving standing alone
    amounted to dangerous driving, a fair reading of his Reasons for Judgment makes
    clear his finding that, in all the circumstances, Mr. Bradley engaged in an
    unsafe pattern of driving, including by choosing to speed with unbuckled
    passengers. The fact that the trial judge tended to describe the manner of
    driving by using the measure of “marked departure” does not demonstrate
    otherwise. It is evident the trial judge used this phrase to describe the degree
    of risk or dangerousness in Mr. Bradley’s manner of driving, something the
    Supreme Court of Canada itself did in <em>R. v. Roy</em>, 2012 SCC 26, [2012] 2
    S.C.R. 60, at para. 40. We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the alternative, Mr. Bradley argues that the trial judge erred by treating
    the fact that the two occupants were unbuckled and on the laps of other
    passengers as relevant to the <em>actus reus </em>of dangerous driving. He contends
    that although a trial judge may consider everything that affects the actual
    operation of the motor vehicle, to be relevant a contextual circumstance must
    be comparable to the circumstances articulated in s. 249(1). We disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 249(1) provided at the relevant time:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b>249(1)</b> Every one commits an offence who
    operates</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>(a) a motor vehicle in a
    manner that is dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances,
    including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle
    is being operated and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might
    reasonably be expected to be at that place.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 249(1) uses the term “including” to make clear that the
    expressed illustrations are not exhaustive. Both the natural meaning of the
    phrase, “a manner that is dangerous to the public”, and the purpose of the
    provision of criminalizing dangerous driving, capture any circumstances that
    enhance the dangerousness to the public of the manner of driving. We see no
    error in the trial judge’s finding that Mr. Bradley drove in “a manner
    dangerous to the public” when he engaged in the pattern of driving that he did,
    with unbuckled passengers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Mr. Bradley argues that the trial judge erred in convicting him
    of the offence of dangerous driving without addressing factual causation. Again,
    we do not agree. Although the trial judge did not dedicate a section of his
    analysis to the causation issue, he made the requisite findings. As the passage
    from his Reasons for Judgment quoted above indicates, the trial judge expressly
    identified causation as an issue in the trial, asking “whether the Crown has
    proven the manner of driving was dangerous <span class=Underline>resulting in</span> the injuries suffered by each victim” (emphasis added). In the course of his
    decision the trial judge identified the “markedly higher risk of injury to
    those additional passengers not buckled in” and commented that “the risk to the
    two unbuckled passengers was blatantly obvious”. He closed his decision by
    finding that Mr. Bradley failed to prevent the risk to those passengers, both
    of whom were particularly seriously injured relative to the other passengers. Given
    that the dangerousness of the driving the trial judge found included the fact
    that there were unbelted passengers on the laps of other occupants, the trial
    judge’s finding that factually the manner of driving caused the injuries to
    these young women is obvious. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is always appreciated when trial judges articulate the contested
    elements of the offence and give each dedicated attention, but it is not an
    error to fail to do so where it is apparent that the required conclusions were
    made. That is the case here.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
