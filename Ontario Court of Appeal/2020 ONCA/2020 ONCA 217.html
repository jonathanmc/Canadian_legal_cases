  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Harvison Young J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants, Daniel Tiffin and his company
    Tiffin Financial Corporation (“TFC”), borrowed money from six people who were
    clients and friends in amounts which totalled $700,000. The appellants provided
    them with promissory notes evidencing the debt. At the time of the loans,
    Tiffin was under significant financial pressure and was subject to a cease
    trading order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to these promissory notes, Tiffin
    and TFC were charged by the OSC with three provincial offences pursuant to s.
    122(1)(c) of the <em>Securities Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5, namely (i) trading
    in securities without registration; (ii) distributing securities without filing
    a prospectus; and (iii) trading in securities while prohibited.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The central issue on this appeal is whether
    these notes were securities within the definition of the Act. The trial judge
    held that they were not, applying the test set out in <em>Reves v. Ernst &amp;
    Young</em> (1990), 494 U.S. 56. On appeal to the Superior Court of Justice, the
    appeal judge found that the notes were securities. He declined to apply the
    American “family resemblance” test from <em>Reves</em> in interpreting the term
    security under the Act and concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that
    the notes were not securities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, I would dismiss the
    appeal from these convictions. In brief, the definition of security in the Act
    is sufficiently broad to capture the promissory notes at issue here. While
    American law is a useful source of persuasive precedent in the securities
    context, the family resemblance test applied by the trial judge does not assist
    in the interpretation of the Act. The definition of security adopted by the
    appeal judge is supported both by the plain text of the Act and the logic of the
    regulatory scheme. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In particular, the Act contains broad
    definitions coupled with equally broad exemptions which relieve vast numbers of
    transactions involving securities from compliance with its requirements. The
    appellants ask us to import the family resemblance test, not because of an
    absence of applicable exemptions to the transaction at issue, but rather because
    pursuant to an administrative order (that is, the cease trade order) they could
    not rely on these exemptions. That quarrel is properly directed at the order,
    not the definition of security in the Act, and, in the absence of any
    legislative intent for the kind of test developed in the United States, I decline
    to impose such a test so that the appellants can escape liability under the
    securities regime in this province.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would, however, allow the sentence appeal. While
    it was not an error in law to impose a custodial sentence per se, the sentence
    arrived at by the sentencing judge is demonstrably unfit.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Tiffin was licenced to sell insurance and
    insurance-based investment products through TFC, of which he was the sole
    officer, director and shareholder. Tiffin was also registered with the OSC to
    trade in securities from 1983 to 1999. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The OSC investigated the appellants and others
    for soliciting investments in Rezwealth Financial Services Inc. (“Rezwealth”)
    without proper authorization. In December 2009, the OSC issued a temporary
    order requiring the appellants to cease trading in securities and prohibiting
    them from relying on any exemptions in Ontario securities law. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>In making this order, the OSC relied on its power at s. 127(1)5 of
    the Act, which authorizes it to “order that any exemptions contained in Ontario
    securities law do not apply to a person or company permanently or for such
    period as is specified in the order.” </span><span lang=EN-CA>This order
    remained in effect until July 2014.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The OSC commenced administrative proceedings
    against the appellants in connection with the Rezwealth matter. The OSC found
    that the appellants and others had traded in securities without registration
    and had illegally distributed securities. In July 2014, the OSC issued a final
    order imposing sanctions on the appellants. Under the terms of that order, the
    appellants were prohibited from trading in securities and from relying on
    exemptions from securities law for five years, in addition to monetary
    penalties and a restitution order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was while he was subject to the cease trade order
    that Tiffin solicited funds from his clients for his personal use and to keep his
    business operating. The clients were told about the OSC’s administrative
    actions and the consequent impact on the appellants’ finances. Six clients
    agreed to loan funds, a total of $700,000, to TFC on terms set out in fourteen
    promissory notes signed by Tiffin on behalf of TFC. The notes provided for
    annual interest rates ranging from 10% to 25% and stated that they were secured
    against a “toy soldier collection” owned by TFC. It is these promissory notes
    that are at issue in these proceedings.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Decisions Below</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Trial Decision Acquitting the Appellants</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, it was undisputed that the appellants
    were not registered with the OSC, they did not file a prospectus, and they were
    prohibited from trading in securities by order. The only issue at trial was
    whether the promissory notes were securities as defined by the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the promissory notes
    were not securities and entered acquittals. He accepted OSC’s characterization
    of the Act as a “catch and exclude” regime, which defined the term security
    broadly and then provided statutory exemptions. However, the trial judge
    concluded that a definition of security that included the promissory notes at
    issue would cast too broad a net and would be inconsistent with the purposes of
    the Act. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In reaching his conclusion, the trial judge
    adopted the family resemblance test from the Supreme Court of the United States’
    decision in <em>Reves</em>. This test involves asking whether the instruments
    resemble securities based on a list of factors including: (1) whether there is
    motivation to make profit, (2) whether the plan of distribution resembles
    common trading for speculation or investment, (3) the public’s reasonable
    expectation that the note is a security, and (4) whether there is another
    regulatory scheme that protects the investor. Based on these factors, the trial
    judge concluded that the promissory notes were not securities because they
    resembled notes secured by a lien on small business assets, which is one “family”
    of recognized non-security notes in <em>Reves</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the trial judge acquitted the
    appellants on all charges.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeal Decision Substituting Convictions</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge concluded that the
    interpretation of the term “security” is a question of law, and the standard of
    review is correctness. He found that the findings of fact of the trial judge
    were not in issue on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge concluded that the trial judge
    erred in importing the family resemblance test into Ontario securities law. He disagreed
    that securities that appeared to fall within the statutory definition should
    nonetheless be excluded based on judicially crafted criteria. Contrary to the
    conclusion of the trial judge, the appeal judge concluded that the broad net
    cast by the definition of security was deliberate and consistent with the
    purposes of the Act and should not be interfered with absent a constitutional
    challenge for overbreadth. The appeal judge referred to the Alberta Court of
    Appeal’s decision in <em>R. v. Stevenson</em>, which declined to import the <em>Reves </em>test into Alberta’s securities regime: 2017 ABCA 420, 61 Alta. L.R. (6th)
    273, leave to appeal refused, [2018] S.C.C.A. No. 54.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge also noted the significant
    differences between Ontario’s securities regulation and that in the United
    States. Specifically, securities regulation in the United States differentiates
    between commercial and investment purposes in a manner that is consistent with
    the family resemblance test, but this is not determinative in Ontario’s scheme.
    Further, the American statutory definition begins with the phrase “unless the
    context otherwise requires”, an inherent limitation that is not present in the
    Ontario Act. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge declined to go through the
    family resemblance test in full, given that he had found it did not apply.
    However, he did point out specific elements of the trial judge’s reasoning in
    applying the test with which he took issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the basis that the trial judge had erred in
    law and that the promissory notes were securities, the appeal judge allowed the
    appeal and substituted convictions.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Sentencing Decision</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The OSC submitted that an appropriate sentence
    would be from 12 to 15 months in jail followed by probation and a restitution
    order. Its submission was that a custodial sentence was required because the
    appellants had not paid previous financial penalties, the promissory notes were
    similar to notes used in the Rezwealth scheme and had been traded while an
    order prohibiting trading in securities was in place. The appellants submitted
    that a custodial sentence was unnecessary and would interfere with Tiffin’s
    ability to repay the money owing. They submitted that the evidence indicated no
    intention to defraud or deceive anyone, Tiffin was not evasive, and five of the
    holders of the promissory notes wrote in support of Tiffin. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal judge noted the statutory maximum
    penalty of $5,000,000 or imprisonment for a term of not more than five years
    less a day or both. He concluded that a financial penalty would not be
    sufficient in this case given the amount still owed in relation to the previous
    offences, and also because Tiffin had exploited a position of trust with his
    clients for financial gain. He accepted that the conduct here was different
    than in the Rezwealth scheme and that Tiffin did not intend to defraud or
    deceive anyone. He noted that the case law range for persons with previous
    convictions usually begins at nine months. Accordingly, the appeal judge
    sentenced Tiffin to six months’ imprisonment, with 24 months of probation and a
    restitution order.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is, in effect, for this reason that the appellants seek to have
    us apply the American law as set out in <em>Reves</em> that narrows the
    definition of security from the outset. If these notes were not securities, the
    appellants were not subject to the requirements of being registered, filing a
    prospectus, or trading while prohibited.</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellants argue that interpreting the definition of security as
    being broad enough to include these notes, notwithstanding the existence of the
    broad and numerous exemptions in the Act, would give rise to unjust results
    because it would sanction activities that, in their submission, should not be
    subject to sanction under the securities regime. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>The difficulty in giving effect to this
    argument is that the appellants’ conduct may well have been exempted from the
    requirements of the Act had they not been subject to an order forbidding them
    from relying on such exemptions. For example, at the relevant time, Ontario
    securities law contained a private issuer exemption exempting distributions of
    securities by those who met the definition of “private issuer” to close friends
    and business associates from the prospectus requirement: <em>Prospectus
    Exemptions</em>, s. 2.4(2).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Additionally, the notes themselves purported, by their terms, to rely on the so
    called “accredited investor” exemption. The exemption, provided for at s. 73.3
    of the Act, exempts some distributions to financially sophisticated parties
    identified in that section and in the <em>Prospectus Exemptions</em>.</span></p>

    of the exemptions, if any, is properly attributed to the order, and is not
    controlling of the definition of security in the Act. Moreover, in addition to
    any other route the law may provide to challenge such an order, interested
    parties can apply to the OSC to exempt specific trades from statutory
    requirements and affected parties may also apply to revoke or vary the order: <em>Securities
    Act</em>, ss. 74, 144. The appellants did not avail themselves of these procedures.</span></p>

    security in the Act is further limited by the principles propounded in the Supreme
    Court of the United States’ decision in <em>Reves</em>. In <em>Reves</em>, that
    court set out the so-called family resemblance test in order to determine
    whether a given note fell within the definition of security for the purposes of
    the American legislation. Under that test, a note is presumed to be a security
    unless it bears a strong resemblance to judicially recognized “families” of
    instruments: <em>Reves</em>, at p. 65. To determine whether a strong
    resemblance exists, the court is to look to the motivations of the parties, the
    plan of distribution, the reasonable expectations of the investing public and
    the existence of other applicable regulatory schemes that would reduce risk: <em>Reves</em>,
    at pp. 66-67. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the following reasons, I disagree with the
    appellants and I decline to import the family resemblance test into the
    definition of security in the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To begin with, there can be no question that
    American law can be useful in interpreting Canadian securities legislation. That
    is because both legislative schemes have similar purposes and intend to address
    similar issues: see <em>Pacific Coast Coin Exchange v. Ontario Securities
    Commission</em>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 112, at pp. 126-28. Both seek to address the
    challenge of casting a broad enough regulatory net to protect the public and
    ensure the stability of the financial system without being so broad as to capture
    activities unconnected to these goals. In particular, the emphasis on
    disclosure in the federal securities regime in the United States had a
    considerable influence on the development of securities regulation in this
    province: Mark R. Gillen, <em>Securities Regulation in Canada</em> (Scarborough: Carswell, 1992) at p. 57.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA> The specific mechanisms the two systems have chosen to address the
    challenge, however, are not identical. Since the origins of modern securities
    regulation in the early 20th century, the securities regimes on either side of
    the border have been developed by distinct legislators and regulators shaped by
    distinct constitutional contexts and accountable to distinct polities. This
    context must be borne in mind when, as here, this court is asked to interpret
    the intention of the Ontario legislator in line with jurisprudence from another
    jurisdiction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>In particular, it is very clear that federal securities regulation in
    the United States was only intended to regulate <span class=Underline>investments</span>,
    and not to create a broad federal remedy for all fraud: <em>Reves</em>, at p.
    61; <em>Marine Bank v. Weaver</em> (1982), 455 U.S. 551, at p. 556. Accordingly,
    courts in that country have distinguished between investment instruments, which
    are subject to the regime, and commercial instruments, which are not. The
    family resemblance test applied in <em>Reves </em>is the manner in which that
    court chose to draw this distinction. The parties disagree on the extent to
    which this distinction is applicable to an interpretation of the Act in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Three key differences exist between the Act and <em>The Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934</em>, 15 U.S.C. § 78a, considered in <em>Reves</em>, such
    that the family resemblance test is not helpful in interpreting the meaning of the
    term security in the Act. First, the definition in the Act, at s. 1(1), opens
    with inclusive language, “‘security’ includes …”, whereas the definition in <em>The
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934</em>, at s. 3(10), opens with language
    indicating an exhaustive definition “‘security’ means…”. The Act therefore
    contains an indicator of breadth not present in the United States’ statute:
    Ruth Sullivan, <em>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</em>, 6th ed.
    (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2014), at paras. 4.34-4.39. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, the definitions in <em>The Securities Exchange Act of 1934</em> are preceded by the phrase “unless the context otherwise requires”: s. 3. The
    intention of a legislator in using these words will not always be to “create
    powerful discretion” for courts to craft additional exemptions to a statutory
    definition, as the OSC contends. However, the Supreme Court of the United
    States has in fact relied upon these words, at least in part, to justify a
    narrowing of the otherwise expansive definition of security: <em>Weaver</em>, at
    p. 556. No such wording is evident in the definition in the Ontario Act and I
    cannot, therefore, follow the Supreme Court of the United States’ reasoning in interpreting
    it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Third, the respective approaches of the two statutes to short-term
    debt instruments demonstrate a broader definition of security in this
    jurisdiction. In <em>The Securities Exchange Act of 1934</em>, “any note,
    draft, bill of exchange, or banker’s acceptance which has a maturity at the
    time of issuance of not exceeding nine months” is specifically excluded from
    the <span class=Underline>definition</span> of security: s. 3(10). By contrast,
    in Ontario, there is no such explicit exclusion from the definition of security
    in the text of the Act. Rather, the OSC, by rule, exempts a distribution of a
    similar class of short-term debt that meets certain criteria from the
    prospectus requirement in the Act: <em>Prospectus Requirements</em>, s. 2.35.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>This distinction is significant. It exemplifies a difference in legislative
    structure. Congress has made clear its intention to exclude these short-term
    debt instruments, which may be viewed as commercial, from the scope of this
    statute altogether, by carving them out of the definition of security. In
    Ontario, meanwhile, there is no indication that the legislator intended short-term
    debt instruments to be understood as anything other than securities. The
    approach taken by the regulator in this province is to enact rules exempting
    them from the prospectus requirement in the Act, rather that excluding them
    from the ambit of the scheme as a whole. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These<span lang=EN-CA> structural differences militate against
    importing the family resemblance test. To do so would risk undermining the legislator’s
    chosen scheme expressed in the Act, which, as discussed above, is to broadly
    cast its regulatory net and then exempt those activities it does not wish to
    regulate. There is simply no indication that the Ontario legislator wished to
    determinatively distinguish between commercial and investment instruments as
    courts have held in the United States. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the parties noted before this Court, appellate courts in Canada
    have come to different conclusions regarding the applicability of <em>Reves</em>.
    In <em>British Columbia (Securities Commission) v. Gill</em></span>, 2003 BCCA
    169, 11 B.C.L.R. (4th) 102, the British Columbia Court of Appeal applied the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Reves</span></em> family resemblance test in reaching the conclusion
    that the documents at issue, namely <span lang=EN-CA>receipts, financial
    summaries and personal loan agreements </span>evidencing debt, were securities
    for the purpose of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Securities Act</span></em>,
    R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 418. I note that the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Gill</span></em> decision considered whether an administrative decision-maker’s interpretation
    of the B.C. <em><span lang=EN-CA>Securities Act </span></em>was <span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>reasonable</span></span>, and it referred to
    the test in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Reves</span></em> to illustrate the
    reasonableness of that decision. The court did not rely on <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Reves </span></em>to narrow the definition of security, but rather
    relied on it to support its breadth. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the more recent case of <em><span lang=EN-CA>Stevenson</span></em>, the Alberta
    Court of Appeal declined to import the family resemblance test into that
    province’s law, given that the “numerous conditions and exemptions” in the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Securities Act</span></em>, R.S.A. 2000, c. S-4, obviated the need
    for “judicially created exemptions” like those in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Reves</span></em>:
    at para. 16. That appeal court upheld the decision of the summary conviction
    appeal court judge concluding that the loan agreements, which were the subject
    of the regulatory prosecution, were “evidence of indebtedness” and therefore
    securities for the purpose of the very similar definition of security in the
    Alberta <em><span lang=EN-CA>Securities Act</span></em>: at paras. 4, 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the conclusion in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Stevenson</span></em>. In my
    view, importing the family resemblance test into the interpretation of the term,
    “security”, would raise a risk of unintended consequences and litigation inherent
    when tinkering with a definition central to a complex regulatory scheme. Moreover,
    and importantly, there is no need to run this risk given the statutory mechanisms
    through which the legislator has seen fit to achieve the goals which animate securities
    regulation. In short, while American securities jurisprudence may be a useful
    source of persuasive authority in some cases, it is not necessary or advisable
    to import the family resemblance test into the definition of security in the
    Ontario context.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To be clear, I do not disagree with the appellants’ submission
    that a legislative provision that is overly broad on its face can, in
    appropriate cases, be “read down” or interpreted in a manner that is narrower
    than the bare language of the text: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Canada Post Corp. v.
    Canadian Union of Postal Workers</span></em>, 2019 SCC 67, at para. 59; <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Blue Mountain Resorts Ltd. v. Ontario (Ministry of Labour)</span></em>,
    2013 ONCA 75, 114 O.R. (3d) 321, at para. 29; <em><span lang=EN-CA>Montréal (City)
    v. 2952-1366 Québec Inc.</span></em>, 2005 SCC 62, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 141, at
    para. 14. This is just another way to express the principle that the words of
    legislation must always be read in context and harmoniously with the intention
    of the legislator. This exercise is distinct from reading down as a
    constitutional remedy: Sullivan, at para. 7.10. In the former case, the courts
    are interpreting the legislation in order to properly give effect to the true
    intention of the legislator. In the latter case, the courts are adjusting the
    scope of the legislation to conform to the Constitution notwithstanding the
    legislator’s intention. <span lang=EN-CA>As I have discussed, however, the
    scheme of the Act is such that the broad definition of security is consistent
    with its object and the intention of the legislator. Accordingly, the purposive
    reading does not assist the appellants.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Regulatory schemes
    can only be effective if they provide for significant penalties in the event of
    their breach. Indeed, although it may be rare that imprisonment is sought, it
    must be available as a sanction if there is to be effective enforcement of the
    regulatory measure. … The potential for serious harm flowing from the breach of
    regulatory measures is too great for it to be said that imprisonment can never
    be imposed as a sanction.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When breaches of
    the Act such as these occur, dealing with failure to register or to file
    required reports designed to protect the investing public, the dividing line

    supervision of the Commission’s investigators.</span></p>

    rigid manner advanced by the appellants. That is, the court determines whether
    the offender being sentenced is a “merely careless” offender or is a
    “designedly evasive delinquent” and this is determinative of whether a sentence
    of imprisonment is imposed: see e.g. <em>R. v. Lewandosky</em>, [1997] M.J. No.

    offenders. Moral blameworthiness is relevant to the sentencing of regulatory
    offenders because it is probative of the responsibility of the offender to
    which the sentence must be proportionate: <em>New Mex</em>, at para. 69.
    However, the sentence must also be proportionate to the gravity of the offence,
    which is unaccounted for in the <em>Bowman</em> principle. In other words, moral
    blameworthiness is relevant, but it cannot be the sole focus of the regulatory
    sentencing judge.</span></p>

    the principles of proportionality and restraint, must impose the sentence
    required to optimally achieve the sentencing goals, of which deterrence is
    paramount. It is unclear how the comparison of the offender to the ideal types
    of the “careless offender” or the “designedly evasive delinquent” assists in
    coming to a fit sentence in the circumstances of a given case. It might be
    contrary to the principle of restraint, for example, to rigidly impose
    imprisonment on offenders based on their intention when the goal of deterrence
    could be achieved with a fine. Equally, a fine may not be sufficient to achieve
    the goals of sentencing in some cases where fraud is not made out. Sentencing
    is inherently contextual. </span></p>

    I agree that given Mr. Da Silva’s history of <em>Securities Act </em>violations,
    the range would start in these circumstances at [nine] months”: at para. 29. Da
    Silva’s history of non-compliance was markedly worse than that of Tiffin. Da
    Silva had been under three separate cease trade orders relating to various
    schemes at the time he committed the offences before the sentencing court: at
    para. 5. Further, unlike this case, his activities were intentionally

    following a trial for similar offences. The sentence was upheld on appeal: at

    six-month sentence was imposed on an offender who pleaded guilty to offences
    that also made out criminal fraud and imposed significant hardship on investors:
    at paras. 19 and 33. By contrast, in this case five out of six lenders wrote in
    support of Tiffin and the appeal judge found that he was truthful with them in
    soliciting the funds. While the appellants did not plead guilty, the appeal
