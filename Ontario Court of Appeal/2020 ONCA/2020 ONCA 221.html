  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) the right to a fair and

    encouraging the reporting of offences and the participation of victims,

    Campbell and Stanton David were in custody. Campbell</span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span
lang=EN-CA>s charges were ultimately withdrawn, but while he was in jail, his
    girlfriend Chelise Strong began a relationship with Ricardo Vincent. Campbell
    was released from prison on May 4, 2012. Over the following days, he
    encountered Vincent and animosity ensued. </span></p>

    on Glamorgan Avenue in Scarborough, Campbell stared at Vincent from inside his
    car and Vincent yelled at Campbell to </span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span
lang=EN-CA>fuck off</span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span lang=EN-CA>. Later
    that day Campbell left a voicemail for Strong saying </span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Tell your little boyfriend I</span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span
lang=EN-CA>m not scared of him. If he wants an issue I</span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span
lang=EN-CA>m not scared of him. Why is he telling me to fuck off.</span><span
lang=EN-CA></span><span lang=EN-CA> On May 13, Campbell was at a night club in
    Scarborough with friends and coincidentally ran into Strong and Vincent. Vincent
    threatened to </span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span lang=EN-CA>fuck him up</span><span
lang=EN-CA> and </span><span lang=EN-CA>said that Strong didn</span><span

lang=EN-CA>broke ugly ass</span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span lang=EN-CA>.
    Campbell retorted that he was still having sexual relations with Strong.
    Campbell later texted Strong saying: (i) </span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Now I see wat [sic] it is, tell ur lil bf when I see him he better
    have it</span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span lang=EN-CA> and (ii) </span><span

    met with L.S., a friend of Vincent and an acquaintance of both appellants. L.S.
    told Campbell that it did not make sense to argue over a girl. L.S. told Vincent

    two began texting and speaking on the phone regularly. They appear to have

    video. He borrowed a .357 revolver from a friend. It was used in the video.
    David can be seen dancing with the revolver. Scenes from the music video
    included Campbell, L.S., and others. David testified that he returned the gun
    to the friend after the video shoot. L.S. testified that in the days leading up
    to the shooting, he saw Campbell and David sharing the revolver and that they

    Barrie to pick up some marijuana to sell. He drove to Barrie with some friends
    and purchased marijuana, returning to 6 Glamorgan around 3:30 p.m. By chance
    Vincent was there. Campbell saw Robichaud, sold some marijuana, and then left
    with friends to continue selling. David had also gone to 6 Glamorgan that
    morning to finish shooting the rap video. He had the revolver with him, which
    he claims he borrowed again from his friend. Around 4:00 p.m., David drove into
    the parking lot and met with friends. Robichaud, who had been hanging out with
    Vincent and L.S., invited David to have a drink with them. After the drink,
    David walked to a different area and waited for other friends to show up. </span></p>

    David and two or three other men were near the car. Vincent got out of his car
    and moved toward the playground/splash pad area. The group of men followed. L.S.

    behind Vincents car and met very close together on a grassy area. L.S. did not
    hear what was said and he did not see a gun. However, he testified that it
    looked like </span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span lang=EN-CA>something</span><span
lang=EN-CA></span><span lang=EN-CA> was handed over and he believed it was a
    gun. L.S. testified that after Campbell and David met behind Vincents car,
    David began moving like he had the weapon. David moved first toward Vincent. Campbell
    followed but then stopped. David was </span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span

  <p class=CQuote>[I]n terms of determining whether the murder was planned and
    deliberate you may wish to consider evidence that:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. There was a gun that was used that was brought either by
    Orville Campbell or by Stanton David to the location;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. Prior to the shooting Orville Campbell said to Ricardo
    Vincent I am always locked and loaded, if you accept that Mr. Campbell said
    that;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>3. There was nothing apparently said between Orville Campbell
    and Stanton David immediately prior to the shooting taking place that might
    indicate surprise or alarm or otherwise suggest that the shooting was an
    unexpected event or done as a matter of impulse;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>4. There was no discussion between Orville Campbell and Stanton
    David on the one hand, and Ricardo Vincent on the other, that would suggest the
    shooting resulted from a sudden or impulsive act;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>5. The events of the shooting were preceded by a dispute
    between Orville Campbell and Ricardo Vincent that had been ongoing for some
    period of time, and during the course of which Mr. Campbell had made threats
    against Mr. Vincent; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>6. Neither Orville Campbell nor Stanton David remained at the
    scene or rendered any assistance to Ricardo Vincent.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>These are not the only pieces of
    evidence that you will want to consider. There are other pieces of evidence
    that might argue against any conclusion that the murder of Mr. Vincent was
    planned and deliberate. The pieces of evidence that I have mentioned are just
    some factors that may assist you in deciding whether the murder of Ricardo
    Vincent was the result of a planned and deliberate act. That is not a
    conclusion that you would have to come to, but it is a conclusion you could come

lang=EN-CA>:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>On one hand, the reviewing court must give
    due weight to the advantages of the jury as the trier of fact who was present
    throughout the trial and saw and heard the evidence as it unfolded. The
    reviewing court must not act as a 13th juror or simply give effect to vague
    unease or lurking doubt based on its own review of the written record or find
    that a verdict is unreasonable simply because the reviewing court has a
    reasonable doubt based on its review of the record.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>On the other
    hand, however, the review cannot be limited to assessing the sufficiency of the
    evidence. A positive answer to the question of whether there is some evidence
    which, if believed, supports the conviction does not exhaust the role of the
    reviewing court. Rather, the court is required to review, analyse and, within
    the limits of appellate disadvantage, weigh the evidence  and consider
    through the lens of judicial experience, whether judicial fact-finding&nbsp;<u>precludes</u>&nbsp;the
    conclusion reached by the jury. Thus, in deciding whether the verdict is one
    which a properly instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered,
    the reviewing court must ask not only whether there is evidence in the record
    to support the verdict, but also whether the jurys conclusion conflicts with
    the bulk of judicial experience. [Citations omitted; emphasis in original.]</span></p>

    The reasoning goes like this</span><span lang=EN-CA>. </span><span lang=EN-CA>Campbell
    handed the gun to David and told him to shoot. By taking the gun and shooting,
    David agreed. It was analogous to a contract killing, which satisfies the

    planning and deliberation. L.S.</span><span lang=EN-CA></span><span
lang=EN-CA>s evidence was that he saw them. He did not hear what was said. The
    exchange was after Campbell had arrived, walked to the splash pad area and
    walked back. It was thus nearer to the end of the nine minutes. There was no
    time at the back of the car for a carefully thought-out scheme with a weighing
    of the advantages and disadvantages. Nor was there evidence to support the
    planning and deliberation.  </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>s position at its highest, when the appellants were behind Vincents
    car, Campbell passed the gun to David and told him to shoot. David took the gun
    and slid alongside the cars and shot. These facts  even when viewed in the
    context of the animus between Campbell and Vincent  do not constitute planning
    and deliberation. There is no evidence from which the jury could infer a
    carefully thought-out scheme with time to weigh the advantages and
    disadvantages of the intended action; Campbell, David and L.S. all testified
    that the shooting happened rapidly.</span></p>

    that Campbell and David had planned and deliberated about the murder before the
    shooting. The appellants did not go to 6 Glamorgan looking for Vincent. They
    met there by chance. The threats were made through Strong five weeks earlier
    and there was evidence that Campbell was in another relationship. The fact that
    the appellants left the scene is equally consistent with an impulsive act as it
    is with planning and deliberation.</span></p>

    death, to a finding that the appellant had planned to inflict harm that he knew
    was likely to cause death. Looking at the evidence through the lens of
    judicial experience, an appeal court must have regard to the real risk that

    trial on those charges has not yet been held. A prosecution witness who is
    awaiting trial himself on charges may have an interest in giving evidence favourably
    for the prosecution in this trial. Favourable evidence here may help the
    witness out with his own case later, or the witness may believe that it will do
    so. In this case you will remember that while [L.S.] said he thought of that
    possibility, he was told very clearly by the homicide investigators, when he
    agreed to give a statement, that there would be no special treatment for him on
    his charges, arising from giving a statement to the police.</span></p>

    circumstances there is good reason to look at [L.S.]s evidence with care and
    caution. You are entitled to rely on [L.S.]s evidence of course, but given
    these circumstances you may wish to look for some confirmation of [L.S.]s

    his closing, the Crown told the jury:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Now, theres an explanation from the pathologist how three
    gunshots could have caused four injuries to Mr. Vincent ... The problem is from
    three shots to five injuries.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Now there was a lot of cross-examination about that. The
    suggestion was put to the pathologist, well, what if the arm is in front? And what
    if the bullet hits the arm and then continues into the chest? Then couldnt you
    have three shots causing five injuries? And he says, no, I considered that. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>So if I am Mr. Vincent holding a gun like David would have you
    believe it was held, unless that bullet travels around and comes through like
    this, that shot is not going through the arm and doing the type of damage where
    youd have three shots causing five wounds. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Theres no injury to Mr. Vincent through the back of his
    forearm. There is no way that Mr. Vincent took two shots. If he took two shots,
    that means that man only took three. Three shots does not cause five gunshot
    wounds. Not in this scenario, not with an injury to the back. It never
    happened. It never happened.</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=CQuote>So if Mr. Vincent wasnt firing the
    two shots, and we know he wasnt, it offends common sense, it offends
    pathology, it offends what we know about bullets travelling in a straight line,
    why do they say this? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that, by claiming that Dr. Hunt had considered and rejected the
    three-gunshot scenario and by suggesting that it offended pathology and common
    sense, the Crown misstated Dr. Hunts testimony. While expressing some doubt
    that the wound to the deceaseds right chest was an entry wound, he unequivocally
    agreed that it was possible that the deceased had been shot only three or four
    times.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>We do not agree that the Crowns closing required a
    corrective instruction. In the entire context of Dr. Hunts evidence, the Crown
    did not misrepresent it. Dr. Hunts opinion was that there <span lang=EN-CA>were
    five separate gunshot wounds. While he considered the possibility that one of
    the forearm wounds might have entered the right chest, he indicated that it was
    low in terms of probability. He said: I know its a possibility, but taking
    into consideration the wound appearance, it seems like its a separate wound.
    While Dr. Hunt did not rule out the possibility that the forearm wound and
    chest wound were inflicted from the same bullet, he explained his opinion as to
    why this was not likely. </span></p>

    attention:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As I earlier
    mentioned, Dr. Hunt said there were five bullet wounds on Mr. Vincents body.
    You know that [L.S.], Mr. Campbell and various people who called 911 reported
    hearing approximately five gunshots. </span><span lang=EN-CA>At the same time
    though, Dr. Hunt did say that it was possible that the five entry wounds on Mr.
    Vincents body were not necessarily caused by five separate bullets.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> We do know that no one else was struck by any bullets, and we also
    know that the police did not find any other bullet holes, for example in any of
    the vehicles that were parked in the area. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vincent
    had prior convictions related to two ex-girlfriends that included aggression
    towards their new boyfriends. The appellants submit that the trial judge erred
    when he instructed the jury that the record was only relevant to self-defence. They
    say that this was circumstantial evidence that supported the claim that Vincent
    was the aggressor on earlier occasions and therefore also on the day of the
    shooting. They submit that this was relevant to the appellants credibility,
    motive and animus. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. The prior convictions were only relevant to Davids claim of self-defence.

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Campbell
    submits that the trial judge erred by not including an instruction on party
    participation. There was no evidence, he says, that Campbell actually committed
    the offence. Further, there should have been an instruction of potential
    liability under ss. 21(1)(b) and (c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. C-46. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The Crown relied on Campbells role as principal to the murder. A
    direct physical contribution to the death is not required to prove causation. It
    was open to the jury to find that his actions in giving David the gun and
    instructing David to shoot were a significant contributing cause of Vincents
    death (see: <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Woodcock</span></em>, 2015 ONCA 535, 336
    O.A.C. 322; <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. J.S.R.,</span></em> 2012 ONCA 568, 112
    O.R. (3d) 81) </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it inured to the benefit of Campbell<em><span lang=EN-CA> not </span></em>to
    have party participation put to the jury for that would have imported more paths
    to conviction. As trial counsel for Campbell said in his closing address: the
    only available basis on which you can say that Mr. Campbell caused Mr. Vincents
    death is through Mr. Campbell directing or instructing Mr. David to shoot him.
    This, trial counsel said, was the key question. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    charge on party participation was not necessary and it would have imported
    unnecessary confusion.</p>
  <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed pursuant to s. 686(1)(b)(i) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>but
    a verdict of second-degree murder is substituted for first-degree murder
    pursuant to s. 686(3). The matter is remitted to the Superior Court for
    sentencing. </p>
