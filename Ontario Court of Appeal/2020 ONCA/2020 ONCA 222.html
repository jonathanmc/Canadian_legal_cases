  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Roberts J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant insurer appeals from the order of
    the motion judge dismissing its motion for summary judgment and granting
    judgment to the respondents. The motion judge found that the appellant had a
    duty to defend the respondents under the policy of professional liability
    insurance issued by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would allow the appeal. In my view, the motion
    judge erred in his interpretation of the insurance contract between the
    appellant and the respondent, Mr. Van Huizen. Specifically, the motion judge
    erred by effectively treating a master policy as the entire insurance contract
    for all members of the Appraisal Institute of Canada (the “AIC”). This
    misconstruction caused the motion judge to conflate two insurance contracts
    that shared standard terms set out in a master policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the terms of the insurance contract
    between the appellant and Mr. Van Huizen, there was no duty to defend in the
    circumstances of this case. However, I would not grant summary judgment to the
    appellant. The issue of whether the appellant had a duty to defend the
    respondents under another insurance contract between the appellant and the
    allegedly negligent appraiser was not decided by the motion judge nor raised as
    an issue on this appeal. It requires determination on a complete record after
    full argument.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant issued the professional liability
    insurance policy number TPL1003399 (the “master policy”) to the AIC for the
    relevant period. The master policy relates to claims made against AIC members,
    as well as their personal corporations, employers, and the AIC, for the
    negligent provision of professional appraisal services by members.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence and settlement section of the master
    policy reads, in part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Insurer shall have the right and the duty
    to defend, with respect to such insurance as is afforded by this Policy, any
    Claim made against an Insured ….</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Coverage under the master policy is extended to
    individual members of the AIC by way of individual application. On assessment
    of the individual member’s risk, acceptance of the individual’s application,
    and payment of the premium, an individual certificate of insurance is issued to
    that member.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Van Huizen is a professional appraiser and
    member of the AIC. He carries on business through a corporation, Inpho Limited,
    operating under the business style of the other respondent, Hastings Appraisal
    Services. The respondents were insured under the master policy and an
    individual certificate of insurance, number AIC 02408, issued by the appellant
    to Mr. Van Huizen (the “Van Huizen insurance contract”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>David Barkley was a professional appraiser and a
    member of AIC. He was also insured under the master policy and his own
    individual certificate of insurance, number AIC 03188, issued by the appellant
    (the “Barkley insurance contract”). Mr. Barkley passed away in October 2016.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In March 2008, under the auspices of Hastings
    Appraisal Services, Mr.&nbsp;Barkley appraised a residential property at the
    request of Sandra Behlok Insurance Agency Ltd.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Three claims were brought in relation to this
    appraisal (collectively the “Behlok proceedings”). Two actions commenced by
    Behlok alleged that the respondents, as the employers or principals of Mr.
    Barkley, were vicariously liable for his negligently performed appraisal of the
    residential property. In his third party claim, Mr. Barkley claimed
    contribution and indemnity from the respondents as his employers or principals
    for any damages payable to the client.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Van Huizen made a claim under the Van Huizen
    insurance contract in relation to the Behlok proceedings. The appellant denied
    coverage, partly because the respondents sought coverage under the Van Huizen
    insurance contract and not the Barkley insurance contract. While acknowledging
    that Mr. Van Huizen was an insured as defined in the master policy under the
    Van Huizen insurance contract, the appellant took the position that the Van
    Huizen insurance contract did not provide coverage for the alleged professional
    negligence of Mr. Barkley. With respect to the Van Huizen and Barkley insurance
    contracts, the appellant maintained that the respondents were not Mr. Barkley’s
    employer and therefore were not covered. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents commenced the underlying action
    against the appellant for a declaration that the appellant had a duty to defend
    and indemnify them under the Van Huizen insurance contract in response to the
    Behlok proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant brought a motion for summary
    judgment to dismiss the respondents’ action against it on the ground that it
    had no duty to defend them under that contract in response to a claim involving
    Mr. Barkley’s appraisal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>DECISION Below</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By the time the appellant’s motion was heard, the
    Behlok proceedings were settled, save for the disposition of costs. As a
    result, the motion judge had to consider only whether the appellant had a duty
    to defend the respondents and indemnify them for their defence costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge reviewed the pleadings,
    interpreted the definitions under the master policy, but did not consider the
    significance of the separately issued certificate. He determined that the
    terms, “Member” and “Insured”, were broad enough to include both Mr. Van Huizen
    and Mr. Barkley who were insured under the same master policy but different
    certificates. As a result, he concluded that “Mr. Van Huizen has coverage for a
    legal claim arising from his own actions and also when it flows from his legal
    status as an employer of the alleged wrongdoer.” He was not asked to consider
    and therefore did not decide whether the respondents were covered as Mr.
    Barkley’s employer under the Barkley insurance contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge also determined that the
    appellant had a duty to defend Mr. Van Huizen in the Behlok proceedings. He
    explained that, in his view, this interpretation was necessary if the vicarious
    liability provision was to have any practical effect:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If this was not the case, there would be no
    need for the vicarious liability provision in the contract. Such liability
    attaches in the absence of any negligence or other fault on the part of the
    employer. If it was the intent of the parties that an insured would only have
    coverage when he or she personally committed the negligent act or omission, the
    vicarious liability protection would be superfluous.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a subsequent endorsement dated September 20,
    2018, the motion judge clarified that the duty to defend included both Mr. Van
    Huizen and Hastings Appraisal Services.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his further reasons dated February 15, 2019,
    the motion judge ordered that the respondents were entitled to reimbursement of
    their defence costs in the amount of $42,000 plus interest. He declined to
    apply and reduce those costs by the $7,500 deductible under the policy. He
    concluded it was premature to do so because the underlying litigation had not
    been resolved and the appellant would recover costs in the litigation that
    could eliminate the deductible.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>ISSUES</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> In my view, the appeal turns on the following issues:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the motion judge err in finding that the
    appellant’s duty to defend the respondents in the Behlok proceedings was
    engaged under the Van Huizen insurance contract?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If the appeal is allowed, should summary judgment
    be granted to the appellant?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree that the motion judge erred in his
    interpretation of the Van Huizen insurance contract and in finding that the
    appellant had a duty to defend the respondents on this basis. However, as I
    will explain, I do not agree that summary judgment should be granted to the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>E.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Applicable Legal Principles</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge had to consider the question of
    whether the appellant had a duty to defend the respondents in response to the
    Behlok proceedings, as he acknowledged, under the Van Huizen insurance
    contract. The motion judge erred by effectively treating the master policy as
    the entire insurance contract for all AIC members. This led him to conflate the
    Van Huizen and Barkley insurance contracts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is therefore important for the purpose of
    this appeal to clarify the distinction between an insurance policy and an
    insurance contract. These words are often used interchangeably. This conflation
    can give rise to considerable confusion, as it did here.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An insurance policy is an instrument. Without
    parties entering into an agreement to be bound by its terms and conditions, it
    is not an insurance contract. By itself, it is “merely a recitation of terms
    and conditions which do not attach to a particular person, item or interest”:
    Barbara Billingsley, <em>General Principles of Canadian Insurance Law</em>, 2nd
    ed. (Markham: LexisNexis, 2014), at p. 58. No legal obligations are created by
    the mere existence of a written insurance policy. Absent a contractual
    relationship incorporating its terms, the words of a policy “are worth less
    than the paper on which they are printed”: Denis Boivin, <em>Insurance Law</em>,
    2nd ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2015), at p. 242.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An insurance contract, by contrast, creates
    contractual obligations between parties: <em>Rayner v. Preston</em>, (1881) 18
    Ch. D. 1 (Eng. C.A.), at p. 10. The formation of insurance contracts is
    governed by the law of contracts. There must be offer and acceptance, and

    of an insurance contract because often parties will agree, as part of their
    contract, to be bound by terms and conditions as set out in an appropriate
    policy: Billingsley, at p. 59; Brown &amp; Mercer, at p. 23. When an insurer
    uses a standard policy, it may issue a certificate of insurance as proof of the
    underlying contract on the terms set out in an applicable policy: Boivin, at p.
    258. But an insurance policy or certificate of insurance is only the
    instrument; it evidences the existence of the insurance contract by which the

    and an insurance policy is recognized by the statutory definitions of
    “contract” and “policy”: <em>Insurance Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, s. 1.
    Under s. 1 of the <em>Insurance Act</em>, “contract” means an insurance
    contract, and <span class=Underline>includes</span> a policy and certificate of

    relevant interpretative principles in determining whether the pleadings and the
    master policy created a duty to defend, he erred in his application of them.
    The duty to defend is a contractual obligation. The motion judge erred by
    narrowing his inquiry to the language of the pleadings and the master policy
    and effectively considering the master policy as the insurance contract between
    Mr. Van Huizen and the appellant. This led him to conflate the Van Huizen and
    Barkley insurance contracts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To be fair to the motion judge, it is easy to
    see why he fell into error. As I earlier observed, the terms “insurance policy”
    and “insurance contract” are often treated synonymously. Nevertheless, in this
    case it was necessary to distinguish between the Van Huizen and Barkley
    insurance contracts and the documents evidencing their terms.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge interpreted the master policy
    as if it constituted a binding contract between the insurer and <span
class=Underline>all</span> members who had been issued a certificate. Given
    that both Mr. Van Huizen and Mr. Barkley held certificates, the motion judge
    concluded that they were both “Insured”, and that Mr. Van Huizen was therefore
    covered under the master policy for liability arising out of Mr. Barkley’s
    alleged negligent appraisal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons I have already stated, the
    master policy does not, however, constitute such a binding agreement on its
    own. It cannot. The master policy merely sets out the terms of professional
    liability insurance being offered to the members of the AIC. It is missing key
    terms on which agreement is necessary to form an insurance contract, including
    the assessed risk, the premium to be paid and the term of insurance: <em>McCunn
    Estate</em>, at para. 19.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Each member who desires coverage must <span
class=Underline>apply</span> for the coverage on terms set out in the master
    policy. The insurer can then assess the individual risk of the applicant in
    determining the premium and in deciding whether to enter into a contract with
    the applicant. Provided the member and insurer come to an agreement on the
    remaining essential terms of the contract and agree to be bound by the master
    policy, the insurer will issue a certificate to the member, evidencing the
    existence of that contract.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It follows that while each member who holds a
    certificate will be bound by identical terms as set out in the master policy,
    they are also bound by the unique terms as set out in their certificates and
    are therefore necessarily party to separate contracts with the insurer. In <em>Re
    Lawton</em>, [1945] 4 D.L.R. 8 (Man. C.A.), at p. 37, Bergman J.A., concurring,<em> </em>noted a similar phenomenon in the context of a group life insurance policy
    for employees of a certain employer:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The master policy is, in effect, merely an
    agreement by the [insurer] with the [employer] to insure the individual
    employees who are eligible, on the terms specified in the master policy. In my
    opinion the certificates issued to the individual employees pursuant to, and in
    performance of, that agreement, constitute the real and effective insurance. I
    am further of the opinion that these certificates are not incorporated in, and
    made part of, the master policy. It is the other way about; the master policy
    is incorporated in, and made part of, each individual certificate of insurance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the certificates issued to Mr. Van
    Huizen and Mr. Barkley each evidence a separate insurance contract on terms
    including those set out in the master policy. The declarations specify exactly
    what constitutes these contracts of insurance: “These Declarations along with
    any completed and signed Application and the Policy, <span class=Underline>each
    Member Certificate of Insurance</span>, and endorsements, if any, shall
    constitute the entire contract between the Insured and [the appellant]”

    is “[a]s per individual certificate”, as well as that the policy period is
    “[a]s per individual certificate”, and that the premium is “[a]s per individual
    certificate”. Further, the master policy summarizes the bargain that underlies
    the insurance contract, namely, that it is “in consideration of the payment of
    the premium and in reliance upon all statements made and information furnished”
    to the appellant, “including the statements made in the Application”, that
    insurance is agreed to be provided.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the motion judge fell into error by
    deciding the question of the duty to defend on the basis of the terms of the

    appellant and Mr. Van Huizen. As a result, his conclusion that the appellant
    owed a duty to defend the respondents under Mr. Van Huizen’s standard form
    insurance contract is not owed deference: <em>Ledcor Construction Ltd. v.

    is not dependent on the insured actually being liable and the insurer actually
    being required to indemnify. It is irrelevant whether the allegations in the
    pleadings can be proven in evidence; for this interpretative purpose, the
    allegations in the statement of claim are to be taken as true: see <em>Progressive
    Homes</em>, at paras. 19-20. An insurer is obliged to provide a defence if the
    pleadings allege facts which, if true, could potentially require the insurer to

    alleged employer of Mr. Van&nbsp;Huizen, is also an “Insured”. As already
    noted, under clause (iii) of the definition an Insured can be an Employer
    (subject to certain qualifications). The use of the qualifier “any” before
    “Insured” in the definition of “Claim” makes clear that the appellant has a
    duty to defend any Insured as defined under Mr. Van Huizen’s insurance contract
    and not just Mr. Van Huizen who is a Member.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    then becomes who is the “Member” under the Van Huizen insurance contract, as
    that term is incorporated by reference in the definitions of “Insured” and
    “Wrongful Act”. Its definition refers the reader to item 3 of the declarations,
    which, as noted above, states that the name and address of the insured is “[a]s
    per individual certificate”.</span></p>

    concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While the definition of “wrongful act” uses
    the definite article “the” referring to “member”, it must be interpreted in a
    manner consistent with the definitions of “claim” and “insured”. Under the
    policy, an insured does not have to be an appraiser; but he or she has to be an
    employer of someone who is and, if they are, the policy grants them coverage if
    they are alleged to be vicariously liable for the negligent acts or omissions
    of that member. As a result, [the appellant] has a duty to defend Mr. Van
    Huizen.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the motion judge erred by seizing on
    the fact that Mr. Van Huizen meets the definitions of an “Insured” and a
    “Member” under the master policy without giving effect to the language in the
    Van Huizen insurance contract that limited the nature of a claim against the
    respondents that the appellant is required to defend. As a result, the motion
    judge effectively conflated the Van Huizen and Barkley insurance contracts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The only certificate of insurance that forms
    part of the relevant insurance contract is Mr. Van Huizen’s certificate. In
    that certificate, only Mr. Van Huizen is identified as an insured. Only his
    insurable risk is the subject of the contract. It is on that basis that the
    appellant determined the risk to be insured, set the premium to be paid, and
    entered into the insurance contract with Mr. Van Huizen.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Barkley’s certificate does not form part of
    the Van Huizen insurance contract. It is different from the one issued to Mr.
    Van Huizen. While issued under the same master policy, the certificate is
    particular to the individual to whom it is issued and evidences only the
    individual insurance contract between the insurer and that member.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since Mr. Van Huizen alone is named as an
    insured in the relevant certificate, he alone is the “Member” for the purposes
    of the Van Huizen insurance contract as that term is defined in the master
    policy. As a result, clause (i) of the definition of “Insured” captures Mr. Van
    Huizen and not Mr. Barkley. Further, vicarious liability under clause (iii) is
    limited to professional services rendered by a “Member”, which again, means
    only Mr. Van Huizen. The definition of “Wrongful Act” is similarly limited to
    professional services provided solely by the “Member”, Mr. Van Huizen.</span></p>

    policy, the certificate of insurance and their definitions, then, coverage is
    provided for any claims against Mr. Van Huizen or his employer respecting Mr.
    Van Huizen’s provision of professional services. The Behlok proceedings did not
    allege that Mr. Van Huizen had committed a wrongful act in rendering or failing
    to render professional services. There is no coverage under the Van Huizen
    insurance contract for any claim related to an act of professional negligence
    committed by anyone other than Mr. Van Huizen.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I respectfully disagree with the suggestion of
    the motion judge that this interpretation renders the provision for vicarious
    liability on the part of the employer superfluous or a commercial absurdity. Rather,
    it acknowledges the privity of contract between the member and the insurer and
    provides for the possibility that the member named in the individual
    certificate may offer professional services not merely as an individual but
    through or on behalf of “any partnership, corporation, or sole proprietorship
    in which a Member was or is now an employee”. Each member’s insurance contract
    provides for coverage for their employers in any claim for the wrongful acts of
    that member. This makes practical, commercial sense.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Therefore, I conclude that this insurance
    contract does not give rise to a duty to defend the respondents for the alleged
    wrongful act of Mr. Barkley.</span></p>

    Appellant</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not grant summary judgment to the
    appellant. The issue as to whether the appellant has a duty to defend the
    respondents as Mr. Barkley’s alleged “Employer” under the Barkley insurance
    contract with the appellant has not yet been decided. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In its statement of defence, the appellant
    expressly addresses the question as to whether the respondents are entitled to
    coverage under the Barkley insurance contract. The appellant pleads they are
    not “Insureds” because they are not Mr. Barkley’s “employer”. However, the
    parties did not bring forward this issue for determination on the motion for
    summary judgment. Rather, they limited the question to whether the appellant
    owed them a duty to defend under the Van&nbsp;Huizen insurance contract. As a
    result, the motion judge only dealt with the issue of whether the appellant
    owed the respondents a duty to defend the Behlok proceedings under the Van
    Huizen insurance contract. Similarly, the issue of coverage under the Barkley
    insurance contract was not raised or argued on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given the way the motion for summary judgment
    was argued and disposed of before the motion judge and on appeal, the question
    of coverage under the Barkley insurance contract for the respondents as Mr.
    Barkley’s alleged “Employer” remains to be determined.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>My proposed disposition of this appeal renders
    it neither necessary nor desirable to determine this issue. The record and
    submissions are incomplete because they focussed on the issue of coverage under
    the Van Huizen insurance contract. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, in my opinion, there remains a live
    issue to be determined as to whether the appellant owes the respondents a duty
    to defend under the Barkley insurance contract. I would therefore dismiss the
    appellant’s motion for summary judgment.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, it was an error for the motion judge

lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant should be entitled to its partial
    indemnity costs of the appeal in the amount of $9,460.64 and, because of its
    success in overturning the judgment granted to the respondents, of the motion
    below in the amount of $6,343.50, both inclusive of all disbursements and

    issue of whether the motion judge erred in failing to apply the $7,500

    costs to the respondents. This issue only arises in the context of the Van
    Huizen insurance contract if the motion judge’s conclusion that there is a duty
    to defend is upheld. Given my proposed disposition of the appeal, it is
    unnecessary to determine this issue. </p>
