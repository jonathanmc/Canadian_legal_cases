  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>R.D. was convicted by a court comprised of judge
    and jury of sexual interference, sexual assault and uttering threats to cause
    bodily harm. He was acquitted of incest. The complainant was his younger
    sister, S.D. R.D. was sentenced to three years in prison (30 months for sexual
    interference; 30 months concurrent for sexual assault; and six months
    consecutive for uttering threats).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant alleged that over the course of
    eight years, commencing in 2001 until 2009, R.D. forced her to perform oral sex
    and digitally penetrated her, eventually having intercourse with her, and
    threatened to hurt her if she told anyone. According to the complainant, the
    abuse began when she was nine years old and R.D. was 18. She believed R.D.
    would hurt her, as there was a history of physical abuse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>R.D. testified and denied the allegations. He
    admitted to having a poor relationship with the complainant and that he had
    pleaded guilty to assaulting her in 2004, ten years before his arrest on the
    current charges. He blamed the physical abuse on anger and impulse control issues.
    He also testified that he had learning disabilities, anxiety and depression.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Z.B., the mother of the complainant and R.D.,
    and J.D., the complainant’s ex-boyfriend, also testified as Crown witnesses at
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>R.D. appealed his conviction on the basis that
    the trial judge’s charge to the jury was deficient. He also appealed the
    dismissal of his application for a stay of proceedings under s. 11(b) of the <em>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. The Crown sought to appeal sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the conclusion of oral argument, we dismissed
    the conviction appeal and the sentence appeal with reasons to follow. These are
    our reasons.</span></p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Alleged Deficiencies in the Jury Charge</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>R.D. asserted that the charge was deficient in
    two material respects: (1) the trial judge neglected to review the defence
    evidence and the inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and that of
    other witnesses, and failed to relate these to the defence theory; and (2) the
    trial judge failed to instruct the jury adequately regarding the elements of
    each offence.</span></p>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The treatment of the evidence</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>R.D. pointed to the failure of the charge to
    provide a separate summary of his evidence at trial. Instead, the trial judge
    summarized the complainant’s evidence, and he made reference to the evidence of
    the other Crown witnesses, while making only passing reference to R.D.’s testimony.
    R.D. submitted that the result was a charge that was unbalanced and unfair.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The standard required of a jury charge is
    adequacy, not perfection. The appellate court’s approach is functional,
    assessing the adequacy of the charge as a whole, in the context of the trial in
    which the instructions were given, and in light of its purpose: </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>R. v. Jacquard</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at
    paras. 32 to 41; </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Newton</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2017 ONCA 496, 349 C.C.C. (3d) 508, at para. 13. The charge must
    provide the jury with a sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to
    the relevant issues from the trial<i>: <em>Jacquard</em></i>, at para. 14. The
    trial judge has an obligation to review the substantial parts of the evidence
    and to relate the evidence to the issues to be decided. What is necessary are
    references to the evidence that are sufficient, in the context of the case and
    the entirety of the charge, to alert the jury to the specific parts of the
    evidence that are of significance to its decision on particular issues and to
    the positions of the parties on those issues. The role of the trial judge is to
    decant and to simplify: </span><em><span lang=EN-US>R. v. Huard</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2013 ONCA 650, 302 C.C.C. (3d) 469, at paras. 53 and 56.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the trial judge’s approach to the
    evidence in his jury charge was focused on the issues at trial. He did not
    simply review the evidence of each witness in a narrative way. Rather, he told
    the jury that he was going to review “some parts of the evidence of [S.D.]”,
    that she was a critical witness in the trial, and that their assessment and
    consideration of her evidence would “go a long way towards deciding this case,
    bearing in mind [the need] to consider all of the evidence”. He then summarized
    parts of the complainant’s evidence, identifying where her account was
    contradicted by or inconsistent with the evidence of the other witnesses,
    including R.D. For example:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After referring to S.D.’s evidence that she told
    Z.B. (her mother) about the first incident just after it happened and that Z.B.
    confronted R.D., the trial judge contrasted this account with Z.B.’s testimony
    denying that S.D. had reported this incident or any other sexual incident, and
    R.D.’s denial that this incident occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After referring to S.D.’s testimony that R.D.
    tried to sexually attack her when she was taking a shower and that there were
    no locks on the bathroom doors, the trial judge referred to the testimony of
    Z.B. and R.D. that there were locks on the bathroom doors.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After referring to S.D.’s evidence that Z.B. had
    walked in on R.D. assaulting her “doggie style”, the trial judge referred to
    Z.B.’s evidence denying she had ever seen such an incident. The trial judge followed
    this with a reference to Z.B.’s account of seeing the two under a blanket,

    other references to the evidence, the trial judge pointed out the key
    discrepancies between the complainant’s account and those of the other witnesses
    that might have served to undermine her credibility. In the context of this
    trial, where the complainant’s credibility was a significant issue, this
    approach was likely more effective than simply providing a witness-by-witness
    summary of the evidence that the jury heard.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for R.D.’s argument that the trial judge’s
    approach failed to relate the evidence to his defence, we disagree. The main
    defence, other than R.D.’s denial of any instance of sexual contact with his
    sister, was that the complainant had fabricated the allegations because she felt
    angry about the admitted physical assaults she had suffered over the years and she
    wanted to have him out of the house where she would be living with her mother
    and young daughter. The jury was reminded repeatedly that the incidents of
    sexual contact described by the complainant were denied by R.D. His own
    evidence did not advance the fabrication defence. In fact, there are parts of
    his testimony that, when recounted as a narrative, may not have assisted R.D.
    in this case: his recollection that on one occasion he was lying on his bed
    under a blanket with the complainant, and that he said “don’t have a dirty
    mind, mom” when confronted by his mother, and his admission that the
    complainant suddenly began keeping her young daughter from him.</span></p>

    the jury believed the complainant. In his review of the evidence, the trial
    judge pointed out the main areas where her evidence was contradicted by or
    inconsistent with other evidence at trial. And, in reviewing the evidence, the
    trial judge repeated on several occasions the need for the jury to be satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual acts had occurred.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At the outset of the trial, the trial judge
    provided a brief explanation of the charges with reference to what was alleged
    in the indictment. He told the jury that the complainant was the sister of the
    accused, and that sexual assault is the intentional touching of another person
    without their consent in circumstances of a sexual nature. He explained that
    the complainant could not consent to count 1, the charge of sexual
    interference. He explained that count 2 alleged sexual intercourse and that
    this is an offence often referred to as incest, and that again the Crown did
    not have to prove that the complainant did not consent. With respect to count
    3, the charge of sexual assault, the trial judge stated that he would reserve
    his instructions about the law on that count until the end, and that he would
    do the same with respect to count 4, the charge of uttering a threat.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his jury charge, the trial judge returned to
    the elements of the offences. He stated as follows with respect to the first
    three counts:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am now going to discuss with you the elements of the offences
    alleged in this case. Counts 1 to 3 on the indictment, and you will have a copy
    of that with you in your jury room, allege sexual offences that occurred within
    stated time periods. At the outset of the trial, and before evidence was
    presented I referred to some of the different elements of each of those
    offences that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt for there to be
    convictions on any of those charges. I referred to Count 1, which is sometimes
    referred to as sexual interference with a person less than 14 years old; and
    Count 2, which is incest, as not requiring proof that the complainant did not
    consent. Consent is not a factor if the person is under a certain age, or if it
    is alleged you had sexual intercourse with a certain, a family relationship.
    Now that the evidence is complete, my instructions to you as to what the
    essential elements to be proven by the Crown are, has become focused and clear
    in this case. [S.D.] has testified that she was the victim of ongoing sexual
    abuse by her brother that escalated from touching her private parts, digital
    penetration, forced fellatio, up to and including intercourse. She did not
    consent to any of those acts and was forced to submit by threats of force.
    [R.D.] has denied that any of the alleged sexual acts took place. You must
    return separate verdicts on each count in the indictment. If you are satisfied,
    in this case, if you are satisfied, based on all of the evidence and my
    instructions on the law, that the sexual acts as described by [S.D.], were
    committed by [R.D.], then Counts 1 to 3 are proven. As I will make clear to
    you, your decision must not be based on whose evidence you prefer over the
    other. There is no onus on [R.D.] to prove he is innocent. The Crown must
    satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of any of Counts 1, 2
    or 3.</p>

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During their deliberations, the jury asked the
    following question: “Charge 3 – Question: (1) for the third charge, please
    clarify the term sexual assault; (2) Please clarify if consent is a factor; and
    (3) Does the age of the alleged victim matter?”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge invited submissions on the
    answer to the jury’s question. Defence counsel indicated that, in the context
    of the evidence, the only question for the jury was whether or not the alleged
    conduct occurred, that there was no evidence in respect of any kind of consent,
    and that if they believed the complainant, the offence would be made out. The
    trial judge answered the question in a manner consistent with these
    submissions. He stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Sexual assault is defined in the <em>Criminal Code</em> as the
    intentional touching of someone else without their consent in circumstances of
    a sexual nature. Now in some cases of alleged sexual assaults, consent is the
    issue. You will have other cases, not this case, where the defence is…there was
    sexual contact up to and including intercourse, and the defence position in
    those other cases is, but it was with consent. And the Crown, in that case,
    must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not consensual. Okay? Now in
    this case, there is no suggestion by anyone, Crown or defence or [R.D.]…that
    any of the alleged sexual events were consensual…the only evidence on the issue
    of consent is from the complainant, who indicated that none of the sexual acts
    were consensual. Okay? But the fundamental issue for you to decide is this, did
    the sexual acts as described by the complainant occur, because if you are not
    satisfied that there were these sexual acts as described by the complainant,
    then [R.D.] is entitled to be acquitted. If you are not satisfied beyond a
    reasonable doubt, this is the fundamental issue to deal with, beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the sexual acts as described by the complainant did
    occur, if there were, if you are satisfied that there were these sexual acts,
    the only evidence on consent is that there was no consent...</p>

lang=EN-US>when the instructions are looked at functionally, and considered
    together with the response to the jury question, which forms part of the
    charge, the trial judge provided instructions on the elements of each offence
    that were sufficient for the jury to perform its task. The kinds of touching
    that the complainant described were undoubtedly assaults of a sexual nature. Consent
    was not an issue. The trial judge and counsel were </span><em><span lang=EN-US>ad
    idem</span></em><span lang=EN-US> that the real issue in this trial was whether
    the jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual acts as
    described by the complainant had taken place. This was underscored by the trial
    judge in the passage set out above. And, not only was there no objection to the
    trial judge’s description of the elements of the offences charged, but defence
    counsel, in his submissions on the recharge following the jury’s question, specifically
    endorsed the trial judge’s approach.</span></p>

    judge instructed the jury on the elements of the offences created the potential
    for inconsistent verdicts. The jury had the indictment which provided
    particulars of what was alleged. In respect of the charge of incest, it was
    clear that the charge was of having sexual intercourse. It is telling that the
    jury acquitted R.D. on the charge of incest, while finding him guilty of sexual
    interference and sexual assault. These verdicts, which are not inconsistent,
    suggest that the jury understood the elements of the offences and were not
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual intercourse, which was an
    essential element of the incest charge, had taken place.</span></p>

    defence counsel stated that “we have just recently received the complainant’s

    further adjournment to March 5, 2015, before setting the pre-trial date. The

    except the information and synopsis was actually ready until January 8, 2015,
    an adjournment would have resulted in any event. As for the second period, R.D.
    says that a period of six weeks was not unreasonable for counsel to review the

lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge did not attribute all of
    the delay in the two periods in question to the defence. She was aware of the
    fact that on each of the earlier dates no, or only minimal, Crown disclosure
    had been provided. The application judge did not attribute any of the delay
    between R.D.’s first appearance and January 8 to defence delay. However, she
    reasonably concluded that <u>some</u> of the delay between January 8 and 29 was
    attributable to the defence because R.D. did not advise that he needed a Crown
    screening form until January 8, which delayed his Legal Aid appointment of
    counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By January 8, the Crown had provided more
    disclosure (in the form of police notes, etc.), and advised that a DVD of the
    complainant’s statement was available but would only be provided to counsel. Had
    R.D. retained a lawyer before the January 8 court attendance, counsel could
    have received disclosure of the DVD at that time. The application judge
    reasonably concluded that, accordingly, at least some part of the delay when
    the matter was adjourned for a further three weeks was attributable to the
    defence delay. There is no evidentiary basis for the assertion on appeal that, even
    if R.D. had asked for the Crown screening form on an earlier occasion, he would
    not have been able to proceed with his Legal Aid application in any event
    because full disclosure had not been made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As for the second period of defence delay, on
    January 29 defence counsel had agreed to an adjournment to February 12 for the
    purpose of obtaining and reviewing the DVD and having a Crown pre-trial. Although
    the DVD was obtained on January 29, on February 12 defence counsel asked for an
    adjournment to March 5, and it was only on that date that a Crown pre-trial
    date was set and the matter remanded to March 12. The application judge
    specifically recognized that a reasonable period of time for defence counsel to
    prepare is not properly described as delay by the defence. However, after
    referring to the fact that the DVD was only two hours long and that the defence
    had received it more than two weeks earlier, she concluded that at least some
    portion of the time between February 12 and March 5 (when the defence was ready
    to set a Crown pre-trial date) was attributable to defence delay and must be
    subtracted from the total overall delay. We see no basis to interfere.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, we see no error in the application
    judge’s allocation of at least six days to defence delay. As a result, there
    was no presumption of unreasonable delay and no onus on the Crown to rebut the
    presumption.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We also do not accept that the application judge
    erred in rejecting R.D.’s argument that the delay, in any event, was unreasonable.
    Where the net delay falls below the presumptive ceiling, the onus is on the
    defence to show that the delay is unreasonable. To do so, the defence must
    establish both that (1) it took meaningful steps that demonstrate a sustained
    effort to expedite the proceedings; and (2) that the case took markedly longer
    than it reasonably should have: <em>Jordan</em>, at para. 82. For cases that
    were in the system when <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>was decided, these factors must
    be applied contextually and flexibly, sensitive to the parties’ reliance on the
    previous state of the law: <em>Jordan</em>, at para. 99; <em>R. v. Coulter</em>,
    2016 ONCA 704, 340 C.C.C. (3d) 429, at paras. 58, 87-89.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge concluded that R.D. had
    not met either branch of the test. She was not satisfied that the defence had
    shown initiative in moving the matter ahead, and the delay in getting the case
    to trial was not a marked departure from the reasonable time requirements of
    the case. She considered “a variety of factors, including the complexity of the
    case, local considerations, and whether the Crown took reasonable steps to
    expedite the proceedings”: <em>Jordan</em>, at para. 87. It was in this context
    that she referred to the delays caused by the circumstances of the Superior
    Court in Toronto in the fall of 2016 as “local circumstances”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>R.D. asserted that the application judge made
    two errors: first, because this was a transitional case, she erred in unduly
    emphasizing defence initiative. Although the first prong of the test requires
    the defence to show a sustained effort to expedite the proceedings, “the
    defence need not demonstrate having taken initiative to expedite matters for
    the period of delay preceding [<em>Jordan</em>].” Second, R.D. argued that the
    application judge wrongly relied on the lack of available judges to hear his
    case as a “local consideration” that justified the delay. He submitted that
    “local considerations” cannot include the government’s failure to appoint
    sufficient judges, and that in this case, the reason for the delay was that his
    trial was adjourned twice because it could not be accommodated by the court,
    which added five months to the total period of delay and resulted in 15 months’
    total time post-committal in the Superior Court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We would not interfere with the application
    judge’s conclusion that R.D. did not establish unreasonable delay. Even taking
    into consideration that this was a transitional case, although defence counsel
    indicated his intention to bring a third-party records application at the
    judicial pre-trial on February 2, 2016, the application was only served in
    September 2016, two months after <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>was released, and
    leaving insufficient time to have the application determined before the first
    scheduled trial date. The application judge reasonably concluded that the
    failure to bring the application well in advance so as not to jeopardize the
    trial date was not consistent with a “sustained effort to expedite the
    proceedings” as required under <em>Jordan</em><i>.</i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, there is no error in the application
    judge’s approach to and assessment of whether the time in this case markedly
    exceeded the reasonable time requirements of the case. She reasonably
    considered the circumstances that existed in the Superior Court in Toronto
    immediately post-<em>Jordan</em>, including the “dramatic decline in the number
    of cases that resolved prior to their trial dates”. We agree with her
    assessment that this was not a “clear case” of unreasonable delay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, we do not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown sought to appeal the sentence,
    asserting that the trial judge did not give effect to an aggravating factor:
    that R.D. was in a position of trust in relation to the complainant. The Crown
    asked this court to find that the sentence was in error and to impose a higher
    sentence of six years in custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <em>Criminal Code</em> provides for a number
    of statutory aggravating circumstances, including that the offender, in
    committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to
    the victim: s. 718.2(a)(iii). The onus is on the Crown to establish the
    aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Here, the trial judge concluded that, while R.D.
    as the older brother was in a position to exert physical and sexual domination
    of the complainant in the home and despite the age difference, this did not amount
    to a position of trust <u>in the particular circumstances</u><i>: </i>at para.
    28<i>.</i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the Crown asserted that the evidence
    fully supported the aggravating factor of R.D.’s breach of trust in committing
    the offences on his much younger sister in the family home, and that the trial
    judge erred in law in concluding otherwise.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We do not agree that the trial judge’s decision
    reveals error. While R.D. was many years older than S.D., and much bigger than
    and physically stronger than S.D., he also had an intellectual disability. The
    evidence was that, until she was 12, S.D. and her younger brother went to a
    babysitter’s home while their mother was at work and that, after that, S.D.
    took care of her younger brother. There was no evidence of a caregiving
    relationship between R.D. and his younger siblings. The trial judge was not
    prepared to accept, in the circumstances of this case, that a position of trust
    followed from the age difference and R.D. and the complainant being alone in
    the home. In our view, the conclusion that, in the particular circumstances of
    this case, the aggravating factor had not been made out was available to the
    trial judge on the evidence.</span></p>
