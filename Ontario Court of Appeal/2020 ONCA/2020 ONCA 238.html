  <p class=Judge><span lang=EN-CA>van Rensburg J.A.:</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants, Angela Beniuk and Dennis Beniuk,
    live at 1735 Concession East, R.R. #1 (the “Beniuk residence”) in the
    Municipality of Leamington, Ontario (“the Municipality” or “the respondent”).
    The Beniuk residence closely abuts Mersea Road East, a rural road originally
    constructed as a farm access trail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Beginning in the summer of 2006, Mersea Road
    East experienced a significant increase in heavy truck traffic. The appellants and
    their neighbours made repeated complaints to the Municipality, and at a council
    meeting in February 2008, they expressed concern that the truck traffic was
    causing damage to their property. The Municipality declined to reconstruct the
    road.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants retained an engineering firm whose
    report concluded that structural damage to the Beniuk residence was caused by
    vibrations transferred to the home from heavy truck traffic on Mersea Road East.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In December 2009, the appellants commenced a proceeding
    before the Ontario Municipal Board (the “OMB”) claiming that the Municipality’s
    pre-1927 construction of the road caused injurious affection. Pursuant to the <em>Expropriations
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26, the OMB (now the Local Planning Appeal
    Tribunal) has exclusive jurisdiction over injurious affection claims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In written reasons issued on January 10, 2018, the
    OMB determined that it did not have jurisdiction over the appellants’ claim.
    The OMB concluded that the claim for damage caused by traffic vibrations
    subsequent to the road’s construction, which was in respect of the use of the
    road and not its construction, was not a claim for injurious affection.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After receiving the OMB’s decision, the appellants
    commenced a civil action in the Superior Court claiming damages for nuisance
    and negligence. The Municipality moved for summary judgment dismissing the
    action. The motion judge found in the Municipality’s favour, concluding that
    the action was statute-barred and that the duty of care under s. 44 of the <em>Municipal
    Act, 2001</em>, S.O. 2001, c. 25 (the “<em>Municipal Act</em>”), to keep roads
    in a reasonable state of repair, is not owed to adjoining landowners.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Beniuks appeal the summary dismissal of their
    action on four grounds. Three relate to the respondent’s limitation period
    defence; one relates to the s. 44 duty of care issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellants submit that the motion
    judge erred in concluding that their action was subject to the basic two-year
    limitation period under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002,
    c. 24, Sched. B (the “<em>Limitations Act</em>”), and not the ten-year
    limitation period under s. 4 of the <em>Real Property Limitations Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (the “<em>RPLA</em>”). Second, the appellants assert that,
    if the two-year limitation period applies, the motion judge erred in rejecting
    their argument that, under s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, it
    was not “legally appropriate” to commence their civil action until after the
    OMB released its decision. Third, the appellants contend that the motion judge
    overlooked evidence of damage to their property within the two-year period
    before they commenced their action; they argue that even if they are statute-barred
    from suing the respondent for conduct occurring prior to that two-year period, they
    should be allowed to continue their action with respect to such damage. Fourth,
    they submit that the motion judge erred in rejecting their claim under s. 44 of
    the <em>Municipal Act</em> on the basis that the duty of care is only owed to users
    of the road and not to adjoining landowners.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Briefly, I have concluded that there was no
    error in the motion judge’s conclusions that a two-year limitation period
    applied and that most of the appellants’ civil action is statute-barred under
    s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em>. However, I would permit the action to
    continue with respect to damage to the appellants’ property within the two-year
    period before the action was commenced. The record supports the existence of
    such damage and there is a genuine issue requiring a trial as to whether the
    limitation period has expired in respect of ongoing tortious conduct of the
    respondent resulting in such damage. Finally, I would leave open for trial the
    issue of whether the statutory duty of care under s. 44 of the <em>Municipal
    Act </em>was owed to the appellants by the Municipality. This question, which
    was decided summarily by the motion judge, should remain open to be determined
    at the time that the appellants’ claim for nuisance is considered. It is
    neither appropriate nor necessary to resolve the issue of the proper scope of
    s. 44 on the limited record and arguments on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Damage to the Beniuk Residence and Traffic on
    Mersea Road East</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Beniuk residence is a one-storey, wood-framed
    dwelling with a basement and detached barn. It was constructed by Mr. Beniuk’s
    grandfather around 1938-1940. The Beniuk residence is located roughly 14 feet
    from the paved portion of Mersea Road East.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The volume of heavy truck traffic on Mersea Road
    East significantly increased beginning in the summer of 2006. The appellants’
    evidence was that, at peak times, they documented one heavy transport truck every
    20 minutes and that the trucks would drive well in excess of the posted speed
    limit of 40 km/h. The appellants’ theory is that the increase in truck traffic resulted
    from the use of a neighbourhood farm as a warehouse for a local food processor
    and other neighbouring farm properties as packing sheds, possibly in violation
    of zoning bylaws.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Between December 2007 and February 2008, the appellants
    and their neighbours communicated with the Municipality about the increase in
    heavy truck traffic, attending council meetings and writing letters. On
    February 11, 2008, the appellants attended a council meeting to communicate
    that the truck traffic was causing damage to their property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The municipal council instructed the
    administration to “review the condition of the road pavement and assess
    alternative road improvement alternatives.” According to a report dated January
    21, 2008, prepared by the Manager of Engineering Services and the Director of Community
    Services, Mersea Road East was built on the remnants of a former marsh. In
    2008, the road structure consisted of a mixture of “old wetland organic
    materials with clay, overlaid with a poor-quality granular material varying in
    depth from 0.1 m. to 0.3 m. (4 in. to 12 in.).” The report noted that the
    engineering firm Golder Associates was of the view that the road could be
    rebuilt by excavating the existing road base and placing a new layer of good
    quality granular material and asphalt, at a cost of approximately $480,000.
    These suggested changes were based on low traffic volumes and a limited number
    of heavy truck trips. The report also recommended changes to the municipal
    heavy truck bylaw.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Municipality decided not to reconstruct the
    road.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants then retained the engineering
    firm CSI Windsor. In its report dated February 28, 2009 (the “CSI Windsor
    Report”), the firm concluded that damage to the Beniuk residence, including
    cracks in the walls, tiles, ceiling finishes, and windows, was caused by
    vibrations transferred to the home from heavy truck traffic on Mersea Road East.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In December 2009, the appellants pursued a claim
    against the Municipality. They commenced proceedings before the OMB, by
    Statement of Claim and Notice of Arbitration, alleging that the Municipality’s
    original pre-1927 construction of the road constituted injurious affection
    under the <em>Expropriations Act</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Municipality delivered its Reply on January
    5, 2010. Among other things, the Municipality pleaded that the OMB claim was
    not a claim for injurious affection and that the OMB was not the proper forum
    or venue to determine the dispute. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-CA>The 2013 Road Repair and Evidence of Ongoing Damage</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 29, 2013, the Municipality wrote to the appellants,
    advising them that the existing road base would be pulverized to construct a
    new “Granular Road Base and New Tar and Chip Surface”. Construction was to
    begin in two weeks. The record includes the call for tenders for this project,
    which is a 50-page document outlining the Municipality’s repair plan. In June
    2013 the road work was completed. On September 6, 2013, when the OMB asked the
    parties for an update, the appellants’ counsel sent a response indicating that
    the attempt to pulverize the road had no material effect in fixing the root
    problem.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants allege that the damage to their
    house is ongoing. There is evidence that their basement flooded in May 2015.
    They retained a second forensic engineer, Luigi Lecce of LGL Consulting, to
    provide an updated report on the structural damage and building losses. The
    report, which is dated December 1, 2016 (the “Lecce Report”), stressed that the
    damage to the Beniuk residence was ongoing:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Some of the same sources that initially
    contributed to the reported stream of <em>Mechanical Damages</em> are <u>still
    ongoing</u>, and therefore preclude the possibility of a stable environment
    within which to mitigate the losses, and repair the Beniuk residence;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the consequences that were
    associated with the suite of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Mechanical Damages</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> that were sustained by the Beniuk residence (between 2006 and 2009)
    and then re-introduced again (between 2009 and 2010), have not abated (<u>because
    the source of the physical disruptions has continued to persist</u>);</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The nature and extent of the conditions
    created by the <u>ongoing nature</u> of both the physical disruptions &amp;
    consequential damages are such that they have continued to prevent the
    mitigation of the sustained losses, and have continued to thwart other interim
    attempts aimed at repairing the Beniuk residence. Consequently, any useful (and
    lasting) progress, directed at resolving the losses, cannot currently be
    achieved;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The sources of the problems (that began to be
    reported by the [Appellants] in 2006) were found to stem from a variety of
    “Synthetic” events (i.e. Physical disruptions associated with the release of
    uncontrolled vibrations that were derived from designed/manufactured/mechanical
    sources, or otherwise generated by machinery) <u>which are still on-going</u>,
    and include the following:</span></p>

    evidence that there was ongoing damage. It had retained its own professional
    engineer, David C. McCloskey, to review the Lecce Report and to comment on the appellants’
    action. Mr. McCloskey disagreed with a number of conclusions in the Lecce
    Report. In his report dated September 11, 2017, Mr. McCloskey noted that the
    Beniuk residence was over 66 years old in 2006 and likely exhibited “typical
    damage and defects of similar structures of this age, namely: building settlement
    causing uneven floors and “sticking” windows and doors, cracks in
    plaster/drywall, etc.” He also suggested that the truck traffic from 2006 to
    2008 would not have had a significant effect on the Beniuk residence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is our opinion
    that the passage of trucks, which were stated as not being more than three per
    hour or fifteen per day between 2006-2008, would not have had a significant
    effect on the underlying layer of “firm, grey black, organic silty clay/clayey
    topsoil” given truck loads are moving loads and the overlying granular soils
    would have acted to distribute the truck axle loads over a larger area at the
    surface of the “firm, grey black, organic silty clay/clayey topsoil”.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. McCloskey also highlighted that vibrations
    from trucks are heightened depending on the speed of the trucks and the size
    and depth of the road’s potholes. He stated that “[i]f the road is smooth,
    ground vibrations from trucks would be minimal.” The Municipality relied on
    this evidence to submit that, subsequent to the resurfacing of Mersea Road East
    in 2013, there would have been no damage from truck traffic, as the vibrations
    would have been “minimal”.</span></p>

    discovery were held on June 12, 2014, and a hearing date was set for December
    4, 2017. The Board raised the question of jurisdiction, and the respondent
    asserted that its position was that this was not a claim for injurious affection,
    and that in any event, the limitation period for a claim before the Board had
    expired. The OMB heard submissions on these preliminary issues, and in written
    reasons issued on January 10, 2018, concluded that it did not have jurisdiction

    594, at para. 5, which laid out three requirements that must be established

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the first requirement, the appellants
    submitted that the relevant “action” of the Municipality was its pre-1927
    construction of the road. The OMB rejected this submission for three reasons. First,
    it stated that the appellants’ claim was largely based on inaction as opposed
    to action. Their submission was essentially that the Municipality had failed to
    reconstruct the road to an appropriate standard and had failed to enforce its
    traffic and zoning by-laws, allowing the truck traffic problem to persist.
    According to the OMB, these were not “actions of a statutory authority as
    contemplated by the [<em>Expropriations Act</em>].” Second, the OMB concluded
    that, even if it were to accept that the claim was based on the pre-1927 construction
    of the road, there was an evidentiary gap as to when the road was constructed
    or whether it was constructed under statutory authority. Third, the OMB stated
    that claims for injurious affection had to be brought by an “owner” at the time
    of or following the statutory action. According to the OMB, the appellants’
    interpretation would result in a problematic floodgate of claims from former
    property owners who are dissatisfied with the condition and operation of their
    roads.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the third requirement in the <em>Antrim</em> test, the appellants acknowledged that the requirement was not strictly met.
    However, they submitted that their claim was novel and nuanced because it was
    about the continued use of a substandard road. While the OMB appreciated that
    the claim was novel, it could not reconcile the appellants’ submission with the
    well-established ‘construction and not the use’ rule, citing <em>Windsor (City)
    v. Larson </em>(1980), 29 O.R. (2d) 669 (Div. Ct.) and referring to <em>Montana
    Equipment Ltd. v. Robert B. Somerville Co.</em>, 2017 ONSC 3092, 67 M.P.L.R.
    (5th) 163, where the court concluded that claims for damage caused by traffic
    vibrations subsequent to the construction of Highway 7 in Vaughan related to
    the use, and not the construction, of the work. According to the OMB, “[t]he
    same [was] clearly true of the Beniuks’ claim, which relates to vibrations
    caused by the continued use of the road in front of their home.” The OMB
    concluded that the appellants’ claim did not meet the definition of injurious
    affection. It stated at para. 25:</span></p>

    appellants commenced their civil action against the Municipality on January 17,
    2018, claiming damages for nuisance and negligence. The parties agreed that the
    affidavits of documents and the transcripts of examinations for discovery in
    the OMB proceedings would stand for productions and discoveries in the civil
    action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Municipality moved for summary dismissal of
    the action. It asserted that the appellants’ claim was statute-barred under the <em>Limitations Act</em>, that the Municipality was not liable to compensate
    the appellants for nuisance, and that there was no claim in this case under s.
    44 of the <em>Municipal Act</em>. The appellants moved for an order dismissing

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    on the limitations issue that are challenged on appeal. First, the motion judge
    held that the basic two-year limitation period under the <em>Limitations Act </em>applied.
    The appellants argued that their action was an “an action to recover land”
    within the meaning of ss. 1 and 4 of the <em>RPLA </em>and therefore subject to
    a ten-year limitation period, which had not expired<em>.</em> The motion judge
    disagreed, concluding that, although the action may have “concerned” land or
    may have been “related” to land, it was not an “action to recover land” in the
    relevant sense: para. 20.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the motion judge held that the action
    was statute-barred under the two-year limitation period. The appellants relied
    on s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <em>Limitations Act</em> to argue that they had not
    “discovered” their claim until after the OMB decided it had no jurisdiction, because
    it was only then that it was appropriate to commence their civil action. The
    motion judge disagreed, concluding that the appellants knew of the forum issue by
    January 5, 2010, at the latest, when the respondent raised the issue of the
    wrong forum in its Reply to the OMB proceeding. The motion judge also found
    that a reasonable person with the abilities and in the circumstances of the
    appellants ought to have discovered that a civil action was appropriate upon
    receiving the CSI Windsor Report on February 28, 2009: paras. 26 and 27.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the motion judge held that there was no “rolling
    limitation period” on these facts. The appellants argued that a new cause of
    action arose every time a heavy truck passed by their house causing damage to
    the home. The motion judge stated that, for this to be the case, there would
    have to be evidence of additional damage to the Beniuk residence in the two-year
    period before the statement of claim was filed (between January 17, 2016 and January
    17, 2018). He concluded that, even allowing that there was a continuing cause
    of action, there was no evidence of any additional damage in the record: “I do
    not find the mere presence of trucks continuing to drive on Mersea Road E., particularly
    following the resurfacing, to be evidence of additional damage sustained within
    the limitation period”: para. 23.</span></p>

    the motion judge declined to consider whether the Municipality was liable to
    compensate the appellants for nuisance (the second issue on the motion). He
    concluded that if he was wrong on the application of the <em>Limitations Act</em>,
    the evidence relied on by the appellants might be entirely different depending
    on which date and limitation period is accepted as appropriate: para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for the appellants’ claim under s. 44 of the <em>Municipal
    Act</em>, the motion judge concluded that the duty of care under that section is
    owed to users of the road, not to adjoining landowners. As authority, he cited this
    court’s decision in <em>Fordham v. Dutton-Dunwich (Municipality)</em>, 2014
    ONCA 891, 327 O.A.C. 302, at paras. 28-30. Accordingly, he held that, even if

    to a dwelling house, its outbuildings, the area immediately surrounding the
    dwelling, and the adjacent land appropriate to its use: <em>McConnell v.
    Huxtable</em>, 2014 ONCA 86, 118 O.R. (3d) 561, at para. 14. The appellants
    also parse out and rely on the phrase “any…right…of…action”. Putting these
    pieces together, the appellants submit that an “action to recover land”
    includes an action to recover rights that run with the land, and that a cause
    of action for nuisance is tied to and arises out of the right to use and enjoy
    land without substantial interference. Accordingly, the appellants submit that a
    cause of action for nuisance is an incorporeal or intangible right that runs
    with the property and is captured by the definition of “land” in the <em>RPLA</em>.
    They point to a passage in <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. 2062277 Ontario Inc.</em>,
    2012 ONCA 235, 109 O.R. (3d) 561, where Perell J. (sitting on this court <em>ad

    to a corporate borrower in February 2005. The defendants personally guaranteed
    the loan. After default, the plaintiff issued a notice of sale under mortgage
    (in December 2007), and after the property was sold, sued the guarantors and
    others for the deficiency. The defendants moved for summary dismissal of the action,
    arguing that it was statute-barred under the <em>Limitations Act.</em> The

    provides for a ten-year limitation period for an action upon a covenant
    contained in an indenture of mortgage. The defendants argued that s. 43(1) did

    asserted that a two-year limitation period applies to claims on guarantees.
    Perell J., writing for this court, disagreed and held that s. 43(1) of the <em>RPLA</em> applied. He explained, at paras. 28 and 30, that the <em>RPLA</em> applied
    because:</span></p>

    guarantee in&nbsp;[<em>Bank of Nova Scotia v. Williamson</em>, 2009 ONCA 754 97
    O.R. (3d) 561] is subject to the&nbsp;<em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>&nbsp;or,
    like the guarantee in the case at bar, is subject to the&nbsp;<em>Real Property
    Limitations Act</em>. However, it does not follow that that all guarantees
    should be treated the same way. It has been the case historically that
    guarantees associated with land transactions have different limitation periods
    from guarantees associated with contract claims. Moreover, as already noted, <u>it
    is my view that the Legislature intended that all limitation periods affecting
    land be governed by the&nbsp;<em>Real Property Limitations Act.</em></u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    observation that “it would cause much more confusion and uncertainty in the
    law, if the limitation period for enforcing the mortgage debt was different
    from the limitation period for enforcing guarantees of that debt”: <em>Equitable

    phrase “action to recover land” in s. 4 of the <em>RPLA</em>, but rather
    “covenant contained in an indenture of mortgage” in s. 43(1). The appellants’

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I begin by noting that <em>407 ETR</em> is not
    authority, as the appellants contend, that a civil action is never an
    appropriate proceeding until after an alternative process has run its course. In
    that case, 407 ETR followed a statutory process that provided a mechanism to
    refuse defaulting customers the ability to renew their license plates until all
    tolls, fees, and interest had been paid in full. 407 ETR commenced a civil
    action against a customer for unpaid tolls, after the statutory process did not
    recover the debt that 407 ETR was owed. When the customer raised a limitations
    defence, 407 ETR invoked s. 5(1)(a)(iv) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, arguing
    that it did not know, and could not reasonably have known, that a civil action was
    appropriate until after the internal administrative process had run its course.
    This court agreed. Laskin J.A. explained, at paras. 39-40:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A civil action
    only becomes appropriate when 407 ETR has reason to believe it will not
    otherwise be paid - in other words, when the usually effective licence plate
    denial process has run its course. Thus, the date when a vehicle permit expires
    for the failure to pay a toll debt is the date a civil action is an appropriate
    means to recover that debt…</span></p>

    proceeding would be an appropriate means to recover a loss must have “regard to
    the nature of the . . . loss”. So, in fixing the appropriate date, it may not
    be enough that the loss exists and the claim is actionable. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>If the claim is the kind of claim that can be remedied by another
    and more effective method provided for in the statute, then a civil action will
    not be appropriate until that other method has been used. Here, a claim will
    not be appropriate until 407 ETR has used that other method, without success.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Laskin J.A. then referred to the evidence that
    the administrative process provided in the statute was typically very
    effective. He also pointed to s. 5(1)(b), which requires the court to take into
    account the “circumstances of the person with the claim”. He concluded, at
    para. 45, that 407 ETR’s circumstances, requiring the processing of an enormous
    number of transactions without the ability to bar defaulting debtors from using
    the highway, suggested that requiring it to sue before finding out whether
    license plate denial had achieved its purpose would be inappropriate: <em>407
    ETR</em>, at para. 45. A third consideration was the need to deter needless
    litigation: <em>407 ETR</em>, at para. 48.</span></p>

    not stand for a general principle that a limitation period will not begin to
    run whenever an alternative process that might resolve the matter has not yet
    run its course. It is a matter of evidence. Indeed, Laskin J.A. noted, at para.
    34, that when an action is “appropriate” will depend on the specific factual or
    statutory setting of each individual case, and that case law applying s.
    5(1)(a)(iv) is of limited assistance because each case will turn on its own
    facts. In <em>407 ETR, </em>the court considered the evidence on the motion
    about the statutory scheme and the effectiveness of the administrative process
    before deciding that it would be reasonable for such a process to run its
    course before a civil proceeding was appropriate.</span></p>

    appropriate will turn on the facts of each case: see, for example, <em>Nelson

    commenced by the appellant in 2013, claiming damages for injurious affection in

    wrote a claim letter stating that the respondent’s construction activities
    caused flooding and damage to the appellant’s property, and indicating that the
    source of the flooding had to be determined immediately. In its response of

    respect of its loss or damage. Said another way, s. 5(1)(a)(iv) does not permit
    a party to engage in litigation in stages for the same wrong. An example is <em>Lilydale

    suggested that after the 2013 repair of the road, vibrations from heavy truck
    traffic would have been minimal, this was not the basis for the motion judge’s
    conclusion. Again, he said that “even allowing that there was a continuing

    manner. It was not a determination of whether the s. 44 duty was owed to
    persons other than the user of the road. In allowing the appeal, Laskin J.A.

    owed the municipality’s duty of road maintenance. In <em>Dick v. Vaughan
    (Township)</em> (1917), 39 O.L.R. 187 (C.A.), this court considered a
    predecessor provision, which was substantially similar to s. 44 of the 2001 <em>Municipal
    Act. </em>The respondent had claimed damages for the economic loss caused when
    he had to use an alternate route for his business because a bridge was not
    strong enough to support the weight of his traction engine and threshing
    machine. The court stated that the statutory duty of care was owed to the
    “travelling public and to no one else” (at p. 191) and that it only applies to
    “what may be in a general way described as accident cases” (at pp. 197-198). The
    court did, however, recognize that in previous cases like <em>Strang v.
    Township of Arran </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1913)</span></em>,
    28 O.L.R. 106 (C.A.) and <em>Cummings v. Dundas (Town) </em><em><span

    to appeal refused: 1907 CarswellOnt 627 (C.A.), adjoining landowners were owed
    the duty to keep roads in a reasonable state of repair when access to their property
    was at issue. In other words, these were cases where liability under the
    statutory provision was found to extend to persons beyond the users of the
    road. Ultimately, in <em>Dick, </em>the court allowed the appeal and dismissed
    the claim on the basis that the loss complained of was not “damages” sustained
    by the respondent by reason of the “default” of the appellants, within the
    meaning of the enactment, and that, if it were, the damages were too remote: p.&nbsp;197.</span></p>

    the court dismissed a claim for damage to an adjoining property resulting from
    drainage of surface water from a roadway. By contrast, in <em>Schraeder v.

    70 O.R. (3d) 204 (C.A.), this court considered a case where a utility pole fell
    and struck a vehicle on a roadway. The municipality argued that the negligence
    claim was really a claim under former s.&nbsp;284(1) of the <em>Municipal Act </em>to
    keep the highway in a reasonable state of repair, and subject to a three-month
    limitation period that had expired. The court noted that the label attached to
    the cause of action by the plaintiff was not determinative, and that the court
    would have to determine whether the negligence in question was in fact a breach
    of a duty imposed by the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Municipal Act: Ouellette</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>, </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>at para. 22. After noting that the
    jurisprudence respecting the scope of a duty of a municipal corporation to keep
    its highways in repair is extensive and that the scope of the duty has been
    defined in broad terms (paras. 25 and 26), the court concluded that the
    specific factual circumstances did not fit within the ambit of non-repair of a
    highway (at para. 27). Moreover, the court noted at paras. 29 and 30:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Most </span><span lang=EN-CA>of the cited
    cases are fairly old. They were decided at a time when there was little scope
    in the common law for actions against municipalities for keeping their highways
    in a reasonable state of repair. Accordingly, courts tended to interpret the
    duty in s. 284(1) in a broad fashion. As explained by Carthy J.A. in [<em>Mero v.
    Waterloo (Regional Municipality) </em>(1992), 70 O.R. (3d) 102 (C.A.)] at p.
    106:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>What we see
    historically is that the law in Ontario has developed on the assumption that
    there is no common law liability upon a municipality respecting maintenance of
    highways except for nuisance and, as the natural evolution of what might have
    been termed a very restrictive statutory cause of action in s. 284(1) has
    progressed, the courts have been increasingly liberal in the interpretation of
    what constitutes non-repair of a highway.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There is no longer a need to stretch the
    wording of s. 284(1) to ground what are, in reality, proposed negligence
    actions against municipalities. That is because in <em>Just v. British Columbia</em>,&nbsp;[1989]
    2 S.C.R. 1228,&nbsp;64 D.L.R. (4th) 689, the Supreme Court of Canada held that
    the traditional tort law duty of care could apply to a government agency
    respecting the maintenance of highways where there was no express statutory
    duty imposed. In the wake of <em>Just</em>, s. 284(1) need not be interpreted
    to cover a situation that amounts to an extension of the statutory duty to
    repair; rather, an action against a municipality in this context can proceed as
    a negligence action, as pleaded in this case...</span></p>

    provision in their Statement of Claim in the civil action, it is not clear
    whether their claim for negligence is limited to a claim for breach of the
    statutory duty to repair under s.&nbsp;44, or whether it extends more broadly.
    Whether their negligence claim is only under s. 44, and whether that section is
    available to them, are matters that should be determined on a full record.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal in
    part. There is a genuine issue requiring a trial as to whether the appellants
    have a claim in respect of damage sustained within the two years prior to the
    issuance of their statement of claim in the civil action, including under s. 44
    of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Municipal Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. If
    the appellants are successful in their action, they will be limited to recovery
    for damages sustained after January 17, 2016.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To reflect the mixed success on the appeal, I
    would award costs of the appeal to the respondent in the sum of $6,500,
    inclusive of disbursements and HST, and I would reduce the respondent’s costs
    in the court below to $10,000, inclusive. </span></p>
