lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application
    judge did not expressly state that Lloyd’s has no duty to defend, though paras.
    37-39 of her reasons would seem to suggest that she concluded that AIG alone
    has a duty to defend all claims in this action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the heading “Does Lloyd’s have a
    continuing duty to defend the City?”, the application judge focused on the fact
    that AIG had a clear duty to defend the underlying action. She held that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par37>37</a>]    Where a plaintiff advances
    allegations of negligence which fall outside the scope of the contract, and the
    insurer has not clearly specified in its policy that the duty to defend is
    limited to covered rather than uncovered claims, then the insurer’s duty is to
    defend all of the claims, both covered and non-covered. See, for example, <em>Carneiro
    v. Durham (Regional Municipality)</em>, <span class=reflex3-alt><span
style='color:black'>[2015] O.J. No. 6812</span></span>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par38>38</a>]    There is nothing <span
class=reflex><span style='color:black'>in AIG</span></span>’s Policy that
    qualifies its duty to defend, or to suggest that the duty to defend did not
    apply to “mixed claims.” AIG could have written qualifying words into the
    policy providing for an allocation of “mixed claims.” It chose not to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par39>39</a>]    If the court acceded
    to AIG’s request there would potentially be three or more lawyers defending the
    action (one for the Waxers, one for the City, and one for Lloyd’s). This simply
    does not make economic sense.</span></p>

    however, she held that AIG had a right to seek contribution from Lloyd’s at the
    end of the action for the cost of defending claims that fell outside the
    coverage of the AIG policy but within the coverage of the Lloyd’s policy. She
    concluded that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[40]    In the result, AIG&nbsp;shall pay all reasonable
    costs associated with the defence of the underlying action, even though those
    costs further the defence of uncovered claims. This is, of course, subject to
    AIG’s right to seek reimbursement from Lloyd’s for costs incurred in relation
    to uncovered claims.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Despite concluding that AIG had a duty to fund
    the City’s defence, the application judge held that AIG was not permitted to
    participate in the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She found that there were two sources of
    potential or actual conflicts of interest between the City and AIG. First, the
    City had launched a cross-claim and third-party claims against AIG’s own
    insureds alleging that they were either liable for breach of contract, for
    contribution and indemnity, or both. Second, as submitted by counsel for the
    City and Lloyd’s, some claims were not covered by the AIG policy and were only
    covered by the Lloyd’s policy. As such, AIG had an incentive to conduct the
    defence so as to impose the majority of liability on the City based on the
    uncovered risk, rather than the covered risk.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge found that there was a
    perceived if not actual conflict of interest. She noted that AIG proposed to
    implement a “split file” protocol where separate claims handlers would be
    appointed to instruct defence counsel for the City and the other defendants in
    the actions, as well as to handle any coverage issues against the City. Their
    files would be screened from the files of other claims handlers and marked as
    confidential.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, she rejected AIG’s
    proposal:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par24>24</a>]    The case for
    independent counsel grows stronger, … considering the crossclaims for
    contribution and indemnity brought by the City and AIG. AIG’s own casualty
    claims analyst admitted at his cross-examination that a perceived, if not
    actual, conflict of interest exists between the City and AIG.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par25>25</a>]    AIG suggests that
    any conflict can be managed by ensuring a separate claims handler at AIG handles
    the City’s defence, and by following a “split file” protocol. This protocol
    consists of physically and digitally screening the file from other claims
    handlers with AIG. The physical documents are put into a folder marked
    confidential, and the electronic documents are marked “internal” or
    “confidential.” AIG’s casualty claims analyst agreed there is no way to monitor
    whether other handlers can access and review the confidential documents.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par26>26</a>]    Further, with no
    written policy setting out a formal practice in respect of managing conflicts
    through the “split file” protocol, AIG&nbsp;has not satisfied the court that
    this ethical wall is adequate to resolve the conflict of interest concerns.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par27>27</a>]    I am mindful of
    Ferguson J.’s very recent decision in <em>HMQ v. AIG</em>, 2019 ONSC 2964,
    where an application identical to the one before me was dismissed. I note there
    were some differences in the evidence in respect of AIG’s “split file” protocol.
    For example, there was no evidence before me that a claims handler would be
    subject to discipline if she/he breached protocol. Further, AIG’s analyst
    indicated there was no way of knowing whether other handlers could access and
    see documents marked “confidential.” Moreover, in that case only HMQ had issued
    a crossclaim, so the potential for AIG being in a position of conflict was not
    as evident.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><a name=par29><span lang=EN-CA>[29</span></a><span lang=EN-CA>]    …
    AIG would only be liable to indemnify the City to the extent of the Waxers’
    liability, so its efforts would obviously be to reduce that exposure and play
    to the uncovered claims’ strength, being the occupiers’ liability claims.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par30>30</a>]    Ultimately, I am
    persuaded by the City’s argument that counsel’s mandate from AIG in respect of
    defending the Waxers can reasonably be seen to conflict with&nbsp;AIG’s mandate
    to defend the City.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She concluded that there is an “irremediable
    conflict of interest” in AIG defending both the City and Hockey Canada and that
    the “split file” protocol proposed by AIG is unworkable in respect of this
    claim for negligence and breach of contract. As such, she concluded that the
    City should be permitted to select and instruct its own counsel without having
    to report to AIG.</span></p>

    enough to cover all claims alleged against the City. As well, because the

    counsel to defend the claims against the City, that counsel will have a strong
    incentive to “settle the claim as quickly as possible as against the City” or “[a]t
    the very least … to try to prove that only the City is liable for the Plaintiff’s
    damages by way of any claims falling outside of what AIG believes is the scope
    of coverage afforded by the AIG Policy”, because the AIG policy only covers
    occurrences arising from the operations of Hockey Canada and Waxers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    and/or the City would also find themselves in a conflict of interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue in this case is not <em>whether</em> the City has coverage for some or all of the claims in the action but which of
    two insurers is responsible to cover which claims in accordance with their
    respective policies of insurance. Consequently, cases which address the
    question of whether there is coverage for all or part of a claim are distinguishable.

lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The AIG policy only covers claims in respect of
    the operations of Hockey Canada and Waxers, while the Lloyd’s policy covers all

    claimed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As such, if Lloyd’s were to retain and instruct counsel, counsel
    might seek to have responsibility for any wrongdoing attributed to the
    operations of Hockey Canada or Waxers rather than the City, so that any damages
    are either shared by or fully encompassed by AIG’s policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Similarly, if the City were to retain and instruct counsel, the City
    has an interest in having claims paid by AIG rather than Lloyd’s, as any
    payment made by Lloyd’s might result in an increase in premiums paid by the
    City pursuant to the Lloyd’s policy. The Lloyd’s policy also has a $100,000
    deductible, while the AIG policy does not. The City has already aligned its
    interest with Lloyd’s, as evidenced by the fact that one counsel represents
    them both on this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    determined on the basis of the City’s actions alone so that AIG is not
    responsible for paying any damages. This is because its policy only covers the incidents
    that arise out of the operations of Hockey Canada or Waxers and because it is
    also defending Hockey Canada and Waxers in the main action;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lloyd’s has an interest in having liability

    to the losses; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The City also has an interest in having
