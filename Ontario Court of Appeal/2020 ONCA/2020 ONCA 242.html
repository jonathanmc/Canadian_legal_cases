  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>the evidence</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s case rested almost exclusively on
    the evidence of the complainant. She testified and, on consent, the trial judge
    admitted a video statement made by the complainant pursuant to s. 715.1 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. That statement, once admitted, became part of her testimony. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In April 2017, the complainant was destitute,
    abusing drugs and trying to survive on the streets by herself. She was 17. Her
    parents had ordered her out of the house earlier. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant found herself alone in a Tim
    Hortons in Thornton, Ontario. She was under the influence of the drug Xanax. The
    complainant contacted a person she knew as “Chicken” on her Instagram. They had
    communicated over Instagram previously. They had never met.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Eventually, Chicken, at the complainant’s
    request, picked her up at the Tim Hortons. Over the next four or five days, the
    complainant and Chicken were constantly together, first, at his mother’s home and
    later at various hotels. They had sexual intercourse on various occasions. They
    were joined by another woman, who the complainant knew as Shanice. The
    complainant soon realized that Shanice worked as a prostitute for Chicken.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Chicken quickly began to pressure the
    complainant to work as an escort. He assured her that she could make some “easy
    money”. Chicken prepared and placed an advertisement offering the complainant’s
    sexual services on a website known as Backpage. Chicken controlled all
    inquiries generated by that advertisement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having  lived on the streets for about two years, 
    the complainant had some familiarity with the world of escorts. She did not
    want to become involved in prostitution and did all she could to avoid meeting
    the “clients” who answered the advertisement placed by Chicken. She and Chicken
    quarrelled over her reluctance to work as an escort. He became very angry. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the  four or five days the complainant
    was with Chicken, she had little sleep and was constantly under the influence
    of drugs that he provided.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant met only one client. He paid her
    the agreed upon amount for sex, but apart from some awkward kissing, they only
    talked. The complainant gave the money to Chicken after the client left. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the fourth or fifth night that the
    complainant was with Chicken, she and Shanice got into a heated argument in a
    hotel room. Eventually, the complainant went to the front desk and asked the
    clerk to call the police. Chicken and Shanice fled before the police arrived. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police took the complainant to the police
    station. A police officer conducted a video interview with the complainant
    later that night. This was the video eventually admitted at trial under s.
    715.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In the course of the video interview, the
    complainant was shown screenshots taken from the complainant’s Facebook page,
    containing photos of a Facebook friend who used the name “Teff Dot”. The
    complainant told the police officer that the person in the photos was the same
    person she had been referring to as Chicken when describing the events of the
    previous four or five days.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant did not know the identity of the
    person she knew as Chicken at the time she was interviewed by the police. The
    appellant was eventually arrested about six weeks later. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her trial testimony, the complainant again
    identified the person in the Facebook photos as the person she knew and
    referred to as Chicken. The complainant also made an in-court identification of
    the appellant as that person. The complainant, who testified by closed circuit
    tv, indicated, however, that she could not see the appellant clearly on the
    camera, although she did notice that his hair was shorter than it had been.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown also introduced into evidence a
    photograph of the appellant taken when he was arrested, about six weeks after
    the complainant spoke to the police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not testify or call any

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial
    judge err in his consideration of the identification evidence?</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no gainsaying the risks inherent in
    eyewitness identification. Equally, there can be no doubt that care must be
    taken by a trier of fact when assessing, and before relying on, eyewitness
    evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is important, however, that the risks be
    assessed in the context of the specific facts of the case. Here, the
    complainant testified that she met a person she knew as Chicken through
    Instagram. She had pictures of that person on her Facebook page. In her video
    statement, she identified the photographs as pictures of the person she knew as
    Chicken, the very same person she had been with continually over the previous
    four or five days. She gave the same evidence at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Facebook photographs, which the complainant
    identified as Chicken, were exhibits at trial. The trial judge compared those
    photographs to the mugshot photograph of the appellant taken some six weeks
    after the relevant events. He said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have examined Exhibit Number 3, the Facebook
    pages, and the mugshot taken in May 2017. Although they were black and white
    photocopies, the Facebook pages were dated January and October. I am satisfied
    they were of good quality. They have sufficient clarity for me as a trier of
    fact to identify the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that the complainant’s
    identification of the Facebook photographs as pictures of Chicken, the man who had
    tried to force her into prostitution, combined with the trial judge’s own
    observation that the Facebook pictures were indeed pictures of the accused as
    shown in his mugshot, was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the appellant and the person who the complainant referred to as Chicken were
    one in the same person.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s primary submission arises out of
    the trial judge’s reliance on his own observation of the Facebook photographs
    to conclude that they were photographs of the appellant. The appellant argues
    that <em>R. v. Nikolovski</em>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197 limits a trier of fact’s
    ability to identify an accused as a person depicted in a photograph or video to
    situations in which the photograph or video is a depiction of the accused
    committing the crime or acting in close proximity to the commission of the
    crime. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is nothing in <em>Nikolovski</em>, the
    case law flowing from it, or logic which supports the limitation advanced by
    the appellant. In cases like <em>Nikolovski</em>, in which the photograph or
    video is relied on as the exclusive evidence to establish an accused’s guilt,
    it follows that the photograph or video must be sufficiently probative to carry
    the evidentiary burden on all essential elements of the offence. In practical
    terms, it must show the accused committing the offence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the Crown did not depend exclusively
    on the identification by the trial judge of the appellant as the person in the Facebook
    photographs tendered by the Crown. The Crown’s case had two planks. First, the
    Crown relied on the complainant’s evidence that the person shown in the
    Facebook photographs was the same person she had lived with the preceding four
    or five days, and the same person who had attempted to coerce her into acting
    as an escort. Second, the Crown relied on the trial judge’s comparison of the
    photographs of the person in the Facebook photographs with the person shown in
    the appellant’s mugshot. Based on that comparison, the trial judge was
    satisfied that the appellant, who was obviously the person shown in the mugshot,
    was also the person shown in the Facebook photographs identified by the
    complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Facebook photographs, on their own, could
    not prove that the accused committed any crime. The complainant’s evidence,
    which the trial judge accepted after careful analysis, established that the
    person in the Facebook photographs, known to the complainant as Chicken,
    committed the crimes alleged. The trial judge’s in-court observations,
    including his assessment of the complainant’s credibility and acceptance of her
    testimony, allowed him to conclude that the person in the Facebook photographs who
    had committed the crimes, was the same person who was before him in court. The
    trial judge’s reliance on his own observations to forge the connection between
    the perpetrator of the crimes and the accused before the court did not offend
    the analysis in <em>Nikolovski</em> or any other evidentiary principle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The other submissions advanced by the appellant
    effectively challenged the reasonableness of the convictions. The appellant
    makes many of the same arguments that were made at trial. For example, he
    submits that the police failed to take basic and necessary investigative steps,
    that the trial judge failed to consider the lack of corroborating evidence, and
    that the complainant had a motive to fabricate the allegations against the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge considered these arguments and
    the other submissions made at trial. He rejected all of them. In doing so, he was
    clearly alive to the dangers associated with identification evidence. His
    analysis reveals neither legal nor factual error. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor can it be said that the evidence could not
    reasonably support the trial judge’s findings. In assessing the complainant’s
    evidence that Chicken was the person shown in the Facebook photographs, it is significant
    that when the complainant identified the picture as a picture of Chicken, she
    had been living with that person on intimate terms over the previous four or
    five days. Her identification of Chicken as the person in the photographs was
    hardly based on a fleeting glance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave careful and thorough
    reasons for accepting the complainant’s evidence, including her evidence that
    Chicken, the person who attempted to coerce her into prostitution, was the
    person depicted in the Facebook photographs. In concluding that the appellant
    before the court was the person in the photographs, the trial judge had regard
    to the quality of the photographs and carefully took into account certain
    differences between the appellant’s courtroom appearance and the appearance in
    the photographs. The trial judge’s findings were reasonably open on the
    evidence and reasonably arrived at by him. </span></p>
