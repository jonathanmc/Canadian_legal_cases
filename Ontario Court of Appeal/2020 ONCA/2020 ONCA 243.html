  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the conviction entered by
    Justice John Kukurin of the Ontario Court of Justice on August 13, 2014, with
    reasons reported at 2014 ONCJ 769, and the sentence imposed on October 9, 2015.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Benotto J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following an afternoon of heavy drinking with her adult son and
    boyfriend, the complainant was seriously assaulted. She told first responders
    that her son was responsible. The son was charged. The mother testified for the
    Crown that her son attacked her and her boyfriend following an argument. Months
    later the trial resumed. This time the mother testified for the defence. She
    changed her testimony and said that it was her boyfriend – not her son – who
    attacked her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The son was convicted of aggravated assault
    against his mother, assault causing bodily harm against the boyfriend and two
    counts of breach of probation. He was given a global sentenced of 30 months in
    custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The son appeals his convictions and sentence. He
    seeks to rely on fresh evidence from an expert in blood spatter patterns to
    support his position that it was not him but the boyfriend who attacked his
    mother. He alleges that the trial judge erred by relying on his mother’s
    utterances to the first responders. Further, he submits that he received
    ineffective assistance at trial because his counsel did not retain a blood
    spatter expert, did not pursue his s. 10(b) right to silence nor his s.&nbsp;11(b)
    rights to a trial and sentence within a reasonable time. He seeks a new trial
    or a reduced sentence to remedy the post-verdict sentencing delay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    conviction appeal, stay the second breach of probation charge, and allow the
    sentence appeal in part.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 8, 2012, the appellant, Gordon Hartling
    was visiting his mother, Sharon Hartling who was at home with her then-boyfriend
    Francis Gill. At the time, the appellant was 41 years old, Ms Hartling was 64
    and Mr. Gill was 62. All three were sitting in the living room drinking several
    bottles of sherry and becoming intoxicated. An argument began and erupted into
    violence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two versions of events unfolded at trial when Ms
    Hartling testified first for the Crown and next for the defence.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence for the Crown</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s case was supported by the evidence
    Ms Hartling gave when called as a witness by the Crown, and the evidence of Mr.
    Gill. Both testified that an argument between the appellant and Ms Hartling
    focused on whether she showed favouritism to his sister. Ms Hartling said she
    did not want to argue and got up to go to her bedroom. At this point the appellant
    punched her twice in the back of the head, knocking her out. Mr. Gill
    intervened, and the appellant turned on him. The appellant hit and kicked Mr.
    Gill until he fell to the floor. Mr. Gill told Ms Hartling to get help. He was
    then rendered unconscious. When he woke up, he called to Ms Hartling, did not
    see her, so left.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Meanwhile, Ms Hartling had gone to her bedroom
    ostensibly to call 911. Her next memory is waking up in hospital with numerous
    severe injures. The Crown contended that the appellant continued beating his
    mother in her bedroom, where forensics later identified a great deal of blood
    spatter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unclear how 911 was contacted but someone
    did call because emergency ambulance responders arrived: two paramedics, two
    firemen and a police officer. One of the firemen recalled seeing the appellant
    walk from Ms Hartling’s room to another bedroom. Mr. Gill was not there. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first responders found Ms Hartling in her
    bedroom. She was sitting on the bed holding her nose. She was crying, clearly
    intoxicated and bleeding. She, the walls and the bedding were covered in blood.
    They asked what happened. Paramedic Onofrio, the first person to see her, said
    she said that her son hit her several times, initially in the living room then
    when she tried to call for help, and that he continued beating her in the
    bedroom and ripped the phone from her. Fireman Johns testified that he heard
    her say that she could not believe her son did this to her. She repeated that
    statement many times as they tried to get information for a medical history. Sergeant
    Bell, who saw her being taken out of the home on the gurney, asked her what
    happened, and she said that her son beat her up.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms Hartling’s injuries were severe. She suffered
    a broken ankle, broken finger, all her left orbital bones were broken into
    small pieces, her nose was fractured in four places and her nose cartilage
    disintegrated. Portions of her skin were displaced. She was in Intensive Care
    at the hospital for over a month. While there she suffered a stroke and
    contracted pneumonia. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gill suffered bruises, sore ribs, shoulder
    injuries, sore jaw and sore leg.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence for the defence</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Several months later, Ms Hartling testified for
    the defence and she recounted a different scenario. This scenario is relied
    upon by the appellant who contends that Mr. Gill and Ms Hartling were the ones
    who started the altercation. Specifically, Ms Hartling confronted Mr. Gill and
    slapped him, and he slapped her back, causing her to fall back on a chrome
    kitchen chair. The chair moved and she fell, further hitting her face on the
    base of the dining room table. The appellant then intervened and had a
    “scuffle” with Mr. Gill. The appellant punched him and told him to leave. Ms
    Hartling says she then got up and snatched a nail file and was poking at both
    men to get them apart. She said the son noted that she was bleeding, and he
    helped her to her bedroom. She said it was the appellant who called 911 even
    though she did not want the police involved. All the while she said she drifted
    in and out of consciousness. She claimed that it was contact with the chair
    and/or table that caused her injuries.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA> Ms Hartling gave the evidence outlined above as part of the Crown’s
    case in February 2013. Fifteen months later in May 2014, she testified for the
    defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Between those two dates, in December 2013, the
    trial judge conducted a <em>voir dire</em> with respect to the admissibility of
    Ms Hartling’s statements to the first responders. In addition, she and Mr. Gill
    separated.  </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Voir dire</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that Ms Hartling’s
    statements to first responders met the criteria for a <em>res gestae </em>statement
    because: (1) they were made under ongoing stress of a dramatic event, (2) the
    statement related to the occasion that caused the stress, and (3) there was
    little or no possibility of concoction or fabrication. Specifically, the
    statements were made right after a severe attack, and there was little time for
    her to have thought of a fictitious story, nor was she in a state of mind to do
    so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He then considered the principled approach to
    hearsay and determined that admission of the evidence was necessary and
    reliable. First, the trial judge found the evidence necessary because Ms
    Hartling could recall what happened to her. Second, there was threshold
    reliability, based on the following circumstances: </span></p>

  <p class=LHeading11>Expert testimony regarding bloodstains</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police took photographs of the home. There
    was blood throughout including in the living room, the hallway, the master
    bedroom and the guest bedroom. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Staff Sergeant Jason Hlady was qualified as a
    bloodstain pattern analysis expert on consent. He had 17 years of experience
    with the OPP and received advanced education and training in the field. He
    provided a basic education to the court regarding bloodstain pattern analysis
    and explained the conclusions he drew from the bloodstain pattern evidence at
    Ms Hartling’s home.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He opined that the there were impact patterns on
    the wall of Ms Hartling’s bedroom attributable to at least one strike to
    something that already had blood on it. The stains could also be caused by
    multiple strikes to the same object covered in blood as it remained stationary.
    This impact pattern has a “transfer pattern with wispy features” indicating
    that hair had come in contact with this area of the wall. After the hair
    contacted the bloody section of the wall a heavy blood stain flowed down over
    this contact pattern. The size, shape and distribution of the bloodstain
    patterns on Ms Hartling’s bedroom wall are typical of what Staff Sergeant Hlady
    would see as a result of an assault or a beating. They are caused by a force
    being applied to a blood source already covered in wet blood being struck. The
    patterns on the wall are not consistent with coughing, sneezing, spitting or
    otherwise throwing blood. They do not have the directionality that such
    patterns would display. Their placement on the wall means the beating would
    have occurred at the height of the chair arm or mattress, approximately 16.9
    inches from the floor.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading>Decision below</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the Crown had proven
    beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who inflicted injuries on
    his mother. He rejected the defence theory that the injuries were caused by a
    slap by Mr. Gill and a resulting fall. The trial judge preferred the testimony
    of Mr. Gill and Ms Hartling’s Crown evidence. He found that Ms Hartling likely
    changed her story after realizing her son was in serious trouble, and at this
    point, she had broken up with Mr. Gill. Her contention that she sustained her
    injuries by being slapped and falling into a chair and table, were inconsistent
    with the extent of her injuries and with the forensic evidence. There was
    extensive blood in her bedroom, rather than the living room where the chair was
    located. The trial judge also considered her statements to the paramedic and
    found her defence evidence not to be credible.</span></p>

    there had been no assault in the bedroom. The expert testimony at trial was
    that the blood stains on the wall of the bedroom were the result of a beating
    or assault. Staff Sergeant Hlady rejected the suggestion put to him by defence
    counsel that the blood stain on the wall could have come from the expiration of
    the blood during Ms Hartling’s coughing or sneezing. </span></p>

    were consistent with an expiration pattern because of the presence of
    “near-misted” blood and diluted blood. The perpendicular direction that the
    stains appeared to originate from, he opines, was more consistent with
    expiration than an impact event. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>An expert must be properly qualified and
    willing to fulfil the duty to the court to provide evidence that is impartial,
    independent and unbiased. In <em>White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and
    Haliburton Co.</em>, 2015 SCC 23, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 182, at para. 32, the Supreme
    Court noted:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Underlying the various
    formulations of the duty are three related concepts: impartiality, independence
    and absence of bias. The expert’s opinion must be impartial in the sense that
    it reflects an objective assessment of the questions at hand. It must be
    independent in the sense that it is the product of the expert’s independent
    judgment, uninfluenced by who has retained him or her or the outcome of the
    litigation. It must be unbiased in the sense that it does not unfairly favour
    one party’s position over another.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A consideration of the admissibility of fresh
    evidence on appeal begins with <em>R. v. Palmer</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>[1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. There, at p. 775, the court
    articulated the following principles:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1) The evidence should generally not be admit­ted if, by due
    diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general
    principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases<em>.</em></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears
    upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is
    reasonably capable of belief, and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when
    taken with the other evi­dence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected
    the result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These criteria have been somewhat refined to a
    three-part inquiry:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>(1) Is the evidence admissible under the operative rules of
    evidence;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(2) Is it sufficiently cogent such that it could reasonably
    have affected the verdict;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) What is the explanation for the failure to adduce the
    evidence and should the explanation affect admissibility?</p>

  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Principles applied</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I consider first the qualifications of Mr.
    Slemko, whether he is an unbiased expert, and whether the proposed testimony is
    sufficiently cogent to have reasonably affected the result. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Mr. Slemko has not worked as a bloodstain analyst since 1998. Nor
    has he consulted for the police since then. Since 2015 he has been an accident
    reconstructionist in the collision investigation unit of the Edmonton Police
    Service. He received his training during a five-day course in 1994, and another
    course in 1997. He has not taken other substantive courses. He testified that
    he does not get paid for his bloodstain analysis work, so his accountant calls
    it a hobby. He was unfamiliar with the leading text on the subject published in
    2015. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>I also have concerns about his willingness to provide impartial
    evidence to the court. A full reading of his cross-examination discloses an
    unwillingness to fulfil his duty to provide unbiased opinion. </span>The
    Supreme Court explained in <em><span lang=EN-CA>White Burgess </span></em>that
    the “acid test [for unbiased expert evidence] is whether the expert’s opinion
    would not change regardless of which party retained him or her.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When confronted during cross-examination with journal-article
    examples of expiration events, he conceded that they did not resemble the
    spatter on the bedroom wall but was quick to point out that this divergence did
    not necessarily exclude the possibility of his expiration theory. When asked
    about the precise location of the high velocity particles that would arise from
    sneezing or coughing, he refused to substantiate his position. When asked about
    the apparent absence of mucus blood stains and air bubbles in scene photos, Mr.
    Slemko did not budge in terms of his theory: “if they’re not present … it’s not
    going to change my opinion at all that this is consistent with expirated
    blood”. He went on to say about the same issue: “I haven’t been able to see it
    because of the type of photography that was conducted. It may or may not be
    there. It if isn’t, that is not going to change my opinion”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Slemko later conceded that his use of terminology in the
    report – “misted” rather than “near-misted” – was in error, but would not
    concede what seems a logical consequence: that the discrepancy at least
    somewhat weakened his opinion in favour of the expiration theory. In multiple
    instances Mr. Slemko was confronted with the limitations of his analysis – the
    granularity of his examination of scene photos, for example – and chose to
    remain adamant in his opinion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    reviewed the cross-examination, it appears that in both substance and tone, Mr.
    Slemko’s opinion was one-sided and did not reflect the independent, objective
    analysis required for an expert.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>A combination of
    his lack of qualifications together with lack of independent judgment leads me
    to find his testimony inadmissible. But there is an additional reason: the
    evidence is not sufficiently cogent to have affected the result. The trial
    judge did not base his findings solely on the Crown’s expert evidence. He
    explicitly stated that the “forensic and photographic evidence do not lead to
    an inevitable conclusion that the son beat the mother”. Further, he
    acknowledged that the fact that bleeding occurred in the bedroom “does not link
    the son as the perpetrator of an assault on the mother”. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected Ms Hartling’s defence
    evidence in part because, had she in fact started bleeding by the chair in the
    dining room or the living room, there would have been “copious amounts of
    blood” on the table, in the hallway and into the bedroom. There were not. The
    copious amounts of blood were in the bedroom. These findings are discussed in
    more detail below. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not admit the fresh evidence. </span></p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge misapprehend the forensic evidence?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that, when the trial judge
    said there was no blood in the dining or living room, he misapprehended
    evidence. The impugned finding relates to his rejection of Ms Hartling’s
    testimony that the main cause of her injuries was what happened when she fell
    on the dining room chair and/or table base. The trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>[<a name=par36>36</a>]</span> </strong>It is clear from the mother’s later testimony as a defence witness
    that she was bleeding after striking the table base. In fact, she said that she
    was bleeding “profusely”. She claims that her son noted that she was bleeding
    and commented on this when he first realized it. Later, while in the bedroom,
    she says that it was her son who wanted to call 911 because she was still
    bleeding. The mother stated that she was hit only once, a slap by the
    boyfriend. No one else struck her. The only inference to be made from this is
    that the bleeding was caused by her head striking the base of the table or the
    chair.</p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><span style='font-weight:normal'>[<a name=par37>37</a>]</span> </strong>The forensic evidence does not support this at all. If what the mother
    recounts as a defence witness is true, there should have been <span
class=Underline>copious amounts of her blood on the base of the table, on the
    floor in the dining room near the table, and down the hallway from the dining
    room area to her bedroom doorway.</span> There was no report of any blood, much
    less her blood, in any of these locations. There were, however, in the forensic
    and first responders’ evidence, reports of quite a bit of blood on the mother,
    on her clothing, on her bedroom walls and on bedding in her bedroom. It is
    inconceivable that the mother was bleeding in the dining room or living room
    area with absolutely none of her blood found there. That she was bleeding while
    still there is clear from her own evidence that her son commented to her that
    she was bleeding and that, after noting this, he helped her down the hallway to
    her bedroom. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says this is not an accurate
    reflection of the evidence. He points to the photographs showing “apparent”
    blood spatter on the living room curtains and photos that show something that
    could be blood on the doorframe to the bedroom</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, these photographs are not
    inconsistent with the trial judge’s findings. They do not show copious amounts
    of blood. All the evidence, including that of Ms Hartling, is that she was
    bleeding profusely. The small amounts of what could be blood on the curtains
    and the doorframe pale by comparison to the bedroom walls and linens that were
    covered in blood. Had her defence evidence been true, there would have been a
    significant amount of blood in the area of the table and chair. There was not.
    Moreover, her testimony that after she hit her head, she witnessed a scuffle
    between her son and Mr. Gill, and tried to poke them with a nail file while
    bleeding profusely, further demonstrated why there would be blood in the area.
    Simply put, the trial judge did not misapprehend the photographic evidence in
    finding that it did not support Ms Hartling’s defence evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In concluding that the appellant was responsible
    for Ms Hartling’s injuries the trial judge relied on the evidence of Mr. Gill,
    and the sheer illogic of Ms Hartling’s defence evidence. </span></p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by admitting the statements to the first

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge <span lang=EN-CA>admitted</span> several statements made by Ms Hartling
    to first responders. Paramedic Onofrio was the first person to see her. On
    entering Ms Hartling’s bedroom, he saw her sitting on the bed holding her nose.
    Paramedics and firemen described her as crying, intoxicated and covered in
    blood. She had an obvious fracture by her orbital bone and a broken nose.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    asked her <span lang=EN-CA>what</span> happened and who did this to her. Ms <span
lang=EN-CA>Hartling</span> replied “my son. He’s up here visiting … I can’t
    believe he would do this to me.” She repeated that statement many times as they
    tried to get information for a medical history. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    went on to say that her son became agitated, aggressive and hit her, initially
    in the living room, then hit her again in the bedroom. As she tried to call for
    help, he ripped the phone away from her. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Ms Hartling was being wheeled out of her bedroom, Sgt. Bell asked her what
    happened. She said her son did it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge admitted these statements into evidence for the truth of their
    contents under the spontaneous utterance (which he also referred to as “<em><span
lang=EN-CA>res gestae”</span></em>) exception and, alternatively, under the
    principled approach. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in applying the spontaneous
    utterances exception because there was, at the time the statements were made,
    the possibility of concoction or fabrication. Ms Hartling and Mr. Gill could
    have collaborated. Further she was clearly drunk and could have mixed up Mr.
    Gill with her son because she said that her son (not Mr. Gill) had left. The
    appellant also points to the gap in time between the attack on her and the
    statements to the first responders. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant <span lang=EN-CA>says</span> that these same factors also should have
    eliminated the trial judge’s use of the principled exception to the hearsay
    rule. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    I refer to the principles and their application to these facts. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>The principles</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Khan</span></em> (<span lang=EN-CA>1988),
    27 O.A.C. 142,</span> at pp. 207-8:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The test for determining admissibility, as Lord Wilberforce framed
    it in <em>Ratten v. The Queen</em>, <em>supra</em> at pp. 389-90, is the
    following: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>... [T]he test should be not the uncertain one whether the
    making of the statement was in some sense part of the event or transaction.
    This may often be difficult to establish: such external matters as the time
    which elapses between the events and the speaking of the words (or vice versa),
    and differences in location being relevant factors but not, taken by
    themselves, decisive criteria. As regards statements made after the event it
    must be for the judge, by preliminary ruling, to satisfy himself that the
    statement was so clearly made in circumstances of spontaneity or involvement in
    the event that the possibility of concoction can be disregarded. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The rationale for this hearsay exception lies in the
    trustworthiness of the utterance which is regarded as furnished by an
    occurrence of so startling or shocking a nature as to suspend the declarant's
    ability to reflect and fabricate. </p>

lang=EN-CA> suggests that the phrase “<em>res gestae</em>” which implies
    contemporaneousness is not correct. Rather, the statement that is made in
    circumstances of reliability is admissible because there is no opportunity for
    concoction. Wigmore’s point is that reliability derives not from
    contemporaneity, <em>per se</em>, but from the fact that the declarant is so
    overwhelmed with, or shocked by, the pressure or involvement of the event that the
    declarant would have no real opportunity for the reflection required to concoct
    a story. My colleague has written that rather than describing this as a <em>res
    gestae</em> exception the better – and more descriptive – phrase is
    “spontaneous statement”.</span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

lang=EN-CA> To be clear, since the sense of pressure or involvement in the
    event will reduce over time, temporal considerations are not immaterial, but
    the focus must be on whether the effects of the pressure or involvement from the
    event are operating at the time the statement is made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>R. v. Nicholas </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>(2004),</span></em><em> </em>70 O.R. (3d) 1 (Ont.
    C.A.), this court considered a 10-minute gap between the event and the
    utterance. There, a complainant awoke to find someone standing by her bed. The intruder
    repeatedly hit her on the head, covered her face with a pillow and had
    intercourse with her. She made an 11-minute 911 call approximately ten minutes
    after the intruder left. In determining that the statement was admissible, the
    court referred to <em>R. v. Dakin</em> (1995), 80 O.A.C. 253. In that case, the
    accused was charged with the murder of two women who died as a result of burns.
    The Crown sought to introduce statements made by one of the women an hour after
    the fire. The court cited <em>Khan</em>, at p. 207: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[A] spontaneous statement made under the stress or pressure of
    a dramatic or startling act or event and relating to such an occasion may be
    admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. The stress or pressure of the
    act or event must be such that the possibility of concoction or deception can
    be safely discounted. <span class=Underline>The statement need not be made
    strictly contemporaneous to the occurrence so long as the stress or pressure
    created by it is ongoing and the statement is made before there has been time
    to contrive or misrepresent.</span> The admissibility of such statements is
    dependent on the possibility of concoction or fabrication. Where the
    spontaneity of the statement is clear and the danger of fabrication is remote,
    the evidence should be received. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Therefore, while a temporal connection to the
    event that triggered the statement is a factor, it is not determinative. The
    admissibility is an issue to be determined by the trial judge. </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>Principles applied</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge admitted all the statements made
    to the first responders that were made in Ms Hartling’s home while being
    treated and prepared for the ambulance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no direct evidence of the time between
    the 911 call and the arrival of the first responders. The Hartling home was 15
    minutes from Sault Ste. Marie where the responders originated from. As the
    trial judge said in his ruling:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>Although no specific evidence was presented as to the lapse of
    time between the traumatic event (or events) between the son and the mother,
    from the totality of the evidence can be drawn the inference that the time
    interval was not very lengthy. The mother was still bleeding from her mouth and
    from her orbital area. Her highly emotional state, her crying and her repetitive
    exclamations suggest that what had taken place between her son and her was
    relatively recent. Her words <em>“Help me, help me”, </em>suggest a perceived
    danger that was still close at hand, or, at least very recently had been.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>All of the statements satisfy the requirements
    of the spontaneous statement exception. With the exception of the statement to
    Sgt. Bell, they took place in Ms Hartling’s bedroom. The statement to Sgt. Bell
    took place in the hallway outside of her bedroom.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the statements were
    made under the stress of a dramatic event and she was repeating herself over
    and over. Further, the beating was the trigger for the statements. She was
    emotional and still bleeding when the first responders arrived and spoke to
    her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that there was opportunity
    to concoct, because Mr. Gill said that when he awoke he called and looked for
    Ms Hartling. He argues that this would have given Mr. Gill an opportunity to have
    Ms Hartling concoct a story. However, Mr. Gill’s evidence was that he did not
    see Ms Hartling after he was knocked unconscious. Even in Ms Hartling’s defence
    testimony she said that she was “in and out of consciousness” and barely
    recalls the ambulance arriving. The trial judge’s ultimate conclusion that “she
    was still and very clearly, under the stress and pressure of the assault upon
    her when she made the statements in question” refutes the allegation of
    concoction and is entitled to deference. </span></p>

    the statements as spontaneous utterances. I note in any event that he also
    admitted the statements pursuant to the principled approach. In light of my
    conclusion, it is not necessary to discuss this approach.</span></p>
  <h2>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err by not applying the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Kienapple</span></em> principle to the breach of probation charges?</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge convicted the appellant on two counts of breach of probation: one
    related to his consumption of alcohol; the other the requirement to keep the
    peace and be of good behaviour. On the first count it was clear that he
    breached his probation by consuming alcohol. But the trial judge said that by
    consuming alcohol he was also not “being of good behaviour” so he breached that
    condition as well. The trial judge did not rely on any other conduct for the
    second count. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the second charge should have been stayed because the trial judge
    relied on the same conduct to ground both charges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown agrees that the trial judge erred but submits that the
    curative proviso should be applied to the second count because there was other
    conduct that clearly violated the terms of the probation order. I do not agree. <span lang=EN-CA>While the appellant committed numerous offences that could
    ground the second breach, I would not apply the proviso. The trial judge
    specifically relied on the consumption of alcohol to ground the second count. I
    am unable to say whether, but for the </span><em>Kienapple</em> <span
lang=EN-CA>error, he would have found the appellant guilty of the second count.
    Nor do I think that, in the circumstances of this case, the interests of
    justice require that the proviso be applied.</span></p>

    two components: performance and prejudice. The appellant must show that (i)
    trial counsel’s acts or omissions amounted to incompetence, and (ii) a
    miscarriage of justice occurred: <em>R. v. Prebtani</em>, 2008 ONCA 735, 243
    O.A.C. 207, at paras. 3-4.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This test presents a high bar that is not easily
    met: <em>R. v. Cherrington</em>, 2018 ONCA 653, at para. 25. As Watt J.A.
    explained, once the first step of the test is established, the analysis turns
    to the third step, or the prejudice component, of whether there was a
    miscarriage of justice. If there was no prejudice, then it is “undesirable” for
    the court to proceed to the second step, or the performance component, of the
    test: <em>R. v. Girn</em>, 2019 ONCA 202, 373 C.C.C. (3d) 139, at para. 92. The
    analysis under the performance component “proceeds upon a strong presumption
    that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional
    assistance”: <em>R. v. G.B.D.</em>, 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para.
    27. The presumption of competence “is tested against a standard of
    reasonableness, and accords no place to hindsight”: <em>Cherrington</em>, at
    para. 26; see also <em>G.B.D.</em>, at para. 27.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>The principles applied with respect to the
    expert</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the appellant cannot meet the
    threshold requirement of prejudice. There was no miscarriage of justice. As I
    have already stated, the trial judge did not base his findings solely or even
    mainly on the Crown’s expert evidence. Recall he said the “forensic evidence
    and the photographic evidence <span class=Underline>do not lead to an
    inevitable conclusion</span> that the son beat the mother” (emphasis added).
    And, while the evidence established that the bleeding occurred in the bedroom,
    the expert evidence “does not link the son as the perpetrator of an assault on
    the mother”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even if trial counsel had retained an expert,
    establishing that coughing – not impact – caused the blood spatter, that does
    not change the fact Ms Hartling’s blood was found on the bedroom walls, not elsewhere
    in the house. Notably, even the appellant’s expert agrees that if a
    “significant bloodletting event” had happened somewhere else in the house, like
    the living room, there would be blood spatter patterns in that spot.
    Photographic evidence corroborates the Crown expert’s view and the trial
    judge’s finding. Even to an untrained eye, the photos show profuse quantities
    of blood smeared across the bedroom wall.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, it appears defence counsel made a
    strategic decision not to call an expert. Counsel’s cross-examination of Staff
    Sergeant Hlady established evidence favourable to the defence: the photos were
    not the best evidence on which to form an expert opinion; and he conceded that
    he speculated that an assault caused the blood spatter. It cannot be said, in
    the circumstances, that the only adequate choice counsel could have made at
    trial was to retain a defence expert.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>The principles applied with respect to the
    exclusion of the appellant’s statements</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the appellant did not testify, the trial
    judge relied on evidence presented about him when determining whether he was
    the person who caused the injuries to his mother. He said that the appellant
    made a statement to Sgt. Bell when she asked what had happened: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>His response was <em>“It is what it is”</em>. This is not the
    response one would expect from a person who was aware of his mother’s
    distressed condition and who cared for her. Nor was it the response of a son
    who had helped his mother after she was slapped by her boyfriend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his appeal factum the appellant submits that
    counsel failed to challenge the admissibility of this statement on the basis of
    voluntariness and the police did not caution the appellant on his <em>Charter</em> right to remain silent until after he was detained in a cell at the station. The
    voluntariness argument was not pressed in oral argument, only the failure by
    trial counsel to bring a s. 10(b) challenge. I will nonetheless address the
    voluntariness issue briefly.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel did not challenge the voluntariness of
    the statement at trial, and the appellant has not appealed on the basis that
    the trial judge failed to conduct a <em>voir dire</em>. I would reject the
    argument that was raised in the factum, that trial counsel was ineffective in
    failing to challenge the voluntariness of the appellant’s statement. There is
    no air of reality to the prospect that the statement would have been found to
    be involuntary if there had been a challenge. The trial judge found that
    statement to have been spontaneous. There were no inducements or coercion
    revealed on the record, and no oppression. The failure to raise voluntariness
    therefore caused no prejudice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I conclude that the failure to bring a s. 10(b) <em>Charter </em>claim did not result in a miscarriage of justice. I say this for two
    reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, although the trial judge considered the
    impugned statement, this factor was not central to the trial judge’s reasoning.
    The trial judge took a number of other factors into account – namely, that the
    appellant was the “only other person in the house when first responders
    arrived” and that remnants of the broken cord of the telephone were found in
    his bedroom. When the first responders entered the home, “a male person was
    seen moving from the mother’s bedroom to the guest bedroom” before the mother
    was found in her bedroom with severe injuries. In her first version of events,
    Ms Hartling said she had gone to her bedroom to call the police, had picked up
    the phone, and that was the last thing she remembered. The telephone cord leads
    to the inference the appellant “took it from the mother and brought it to his
    bedroom”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant was not detained when he
    made that statement. One of the firefighters, Mr. Nolan, was concerned the
    appellant was going to be aggressive, so he kept the bedroom door closed to avoid
    “‘deal[ing] with him’ while they were treating Ms Hartling”. He closed the door
    so that the paramedics could “do their job” without him getting in the way.
    This type of detention is not the same as being detained by law enforcement.
    Nothing prevented the appellant from leaving the house. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I note here as well that trial counsel’s
    decision not to challenge the admissibility was strategic. He testified that
    the right to counsel was not a “great argument”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no miscarriage of justice with respect
    to counsel’s decision not to challenge the statement to Sgt. Bell.</span></p>
  <h2>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in principle in imposing the sentence? </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge <span lang=EN-CA>erred</span> in
    principle by failing to give effect to the mitigating factors of the appellant’s
    alcohol addiction and history of family violence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not <span lang=EN-CA>agree</span>. <span lang=EN-CA>The
    trial judge’s reasons for sentence provided due consideration to the relevant
    aggravating and mitigating factors, including the <em>Gladue </em>report. I see
    no error in principle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant </span>further <span lang=EN-CA>submits</span> that
    the sentence should be clarified so that it is served in a provincial
    reformatory as intended by the trial judge when he said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I am particularly aware that the duration of incarceration
    would place the offender in a provincial correctional institution as opposed to
    a penitentiary. That is my intention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown agrees and understands that the

    for reasonable apprehension of bias is high, and this case clearly did not meet
    the standard. The trial judge’s comment was not inappropriate, nor did it
    prejudice the accused. The recusal motion had no merit. Accordingly, the
    six-month period of delay caused by the recusal motion should be attributed to
    the defence. In addition, the subsequent delay that was caused while waiting
    for trial to resume was also attributed to the accused. The recusal motion
    resulted in a delay of an additional two months because of the time for a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The post-verdict delay is another matter. It
    took 14 months after conviction for the sentence to be imposed. This delay was
    not caused by ineffective judicial management. It was not caused by the
    appellant, nor was it caused directly by the actions of the prosecutor. It was
    caused by the lack of institutional resources to obtain a <em>Gladue</em> report.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Immediately upon conviction, trial counsel
    obtained an order for a <em>Gladue</em> report from the trial judge. However,
    court administration services denied funding. At the time – as difficult to
    understand as it seems – there was only one <em>Gladue </em>writer in the
    Algoma district. There were no <em>Gladue</em> writers provided by Aboriginal
    Legal Services in the Algoma district. Therefore, there were only two options:
    (a) paying privately out of pocket; or (b) obtaining Legal Aid funding.
    Ultimately, the appellant, with the assistance of his counsel, chose to pay
    privately. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue of post-verdict delay was addressed by
    this court in<em> R. v. Charley, </em>2019 ONCA 726, 147 O.R. (3d) 497,<em> </em>where
    a presumptive ceiling of five months was set for the time from verdict to
    sentence. At paras. 86 and 87, Doherty J.A. explained:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In fixing a presumptive ceiling, I
    bear in mind that the presumptive ceiling is not intended to identify the
    amount of time it should take to move the case from verdict to sentence. As
    stated by the majority in <em>Jordan</em>, at para. <span lang=EN>56</span>:</p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>We also make this observation about the
    presumptive ceiling. It is not an aspirational target. Rather, it is the point
    at which delay becomes presumptively unreasonable. The public should expect
    that most cases can and should be resolved before reaching the ceiling. For
    this reason, as we will explain, the Crown bears the onus of justifying delays
    that exceed the ceiling. It is also for this reason that an accused may in
    clear cases still demonstrate that his or her right to be tried within a
    reasonable time has been infringed, even before the ceiling has been breached.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>I would set the presumptive ceiling for post-verdict delay at
    five months. In doing so, I stress that five months is not the norm, and should
    not be allowed to become the norm. Instead, five months is the point at which
    the delay is sufficiently long that it is regarded as presumptively
    unreasonable for the purposes of s. 11(b). The onus falls to the Crown to
    justify the delay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Five months is the point at which post-verdict delay to sentence
    becomes presumptively unreasonable. Fourteen months is nearly three times the
    delay. So the burden now shifts to the Crown to justify the delay.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In
    an attempt to justify the delay, the Crown alleges extraordinary circumstances
    because of the issues with the</span><em><span lang=EN-CA> Gladue</span></em><span
lang=EN> report and because the case was already in the system when </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em><span lang=EN> was decided. </span></p>

lang=EN>I do not agree that the circumstances are exceptional. It cannot be
    said that it is exceptional to require a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Gladue</span></em><span
lang=EN> report in the Algoma district where there is a large Indigenous
    population. </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Gladue</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> reports were created in order to address systemic injustice that uniquely
    affects Indigenous offenders, and which leads to overrepresentation in the
    criminal justice system. A long delay undermines the purpose of the <em>Gladue</em> report by creating another level of unfairness. Moreover, to submit that the
    preparation of such a report is exceptional is untenable. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The second branch of the Crown’s justification for the delay is that
    this case was already “in the system” on the release of <em>Charley. </em>Therefore,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[105]<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The
    impact on transitional cases </span><span lang=EN-CA>was addressed in <em>Charley</em>,<em> </em>at para. 105:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>I make one further observation with respect to the application
    of the <em>Jordan</em> analysis to post-verdict delay. <em>Jordan</em> recognized that the new framework it put in place should be applied somewhat
    differently in respect of cases that were in the system before <em>Jordan </em>was
    released: see <em>Jordan</em>, at paras. 95-100. The majority described
    transitional exceptional circumstances that could, in some situations, justify
    delay above the presumptive ceiling. I would take the same approach in applying
    the presumptive ceiling applicable to post-verdict delay set down in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>According
    to </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN>, the new
    framework, including the presumptive ceiling, applies to cases currently in the
    system, subject to qualifications: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>[<a name=par96>96</a>] First, for
    cases in which the delay <em>exceeds</em> the ceiling, a transitional
    exceptional circumstance may arise where the charges were brought prior to the
    release of this decision. <span class=Underline>This transitional exceptional
    circumstance will apply when the Crown satisfies the court that the time the
    case has taken is justified based on the parties’ reasonable reliance on the
    law as it previously existed</span>. This requires a contextual assessment,
    sensitive to the manner in which the previous framework was applied, and the
    fact that the parties’ behaviour cannot be judged strictly, against a standard
    of which they had no notice. For example, prejudice and the seriousness of the
    offence often played a decisive role in whether delay was unreasonable under
    the previous framework. For cases currently in the system, these considerations
    can therefore inform whether the parties’ reliance on the previous state of the
    law was reasonable. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[<a name=par97>97</a>] Moreover,
    the delay may exceed the ceiling because the case is of moderate complexity in
    a jurisdiction with significant institutional delay problems. Judges in
    jurisdictions plagued by lengthy, persistent, and notorious institutional
    delays should account for this reality, as Crown counsel’s behaviour is
    constrained by systemic delay issues. </p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[<a name=par100>100</a>] Further, if the
    delay was occasioned by an institutional delay that was reasonably acceptable
    in the relevant jurisdiction under the <em>Morin </em>framework before this
    decision was released, that institutional delay will be a component of the
    reasonable time requirements of the case for cases currently in the system. [Emphasis
    added].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>These
    qualifications do not apply here. There was no reasonable reliance on the
    appropriateness of the long delay. The delay was not a result of a “change
    [that] takes time” to implement. </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Gladue</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688,</span></em><span
lang=EN> was decided in 1999. Before the release of </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em><span lang=EN>, it could not be said that a
    14-month delay was acceptable. Nor can it be said that the parties would have
    been reasonable to rely on the previous state of the law. A 14-month delay was
    unreasonable then, and it is now. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The 14-month post-conviction delay was unreasonable and breached the
    appellant’s s. 11(b) <em>Charter</em> rights. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This brings me to remedy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Although no post-verdict delay was found in <em>Charley</em>,<em> </em>this
    court discussed the remedy when a post-conviction breach is found. When the
    breach is pre-verdict, a stay is the only available remedy. Post-verdict is
    different. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Compare the rationale to that of a pre-verdict breach. A pre-verdict
    breach targets conviction because – as explained in <em>R. v. Rahey</em></span><span
lang=EN>,</span><span lang=EN> </span><span lang=EN>[1987] 1 S.C.R. 588 – the
    court loses jurisdiction when there is an s. 11(b) breach before trial. If an accused
    has the right to be tried within a certain time, the accused has the right </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>not</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> to be tried beyond that point and
    “no trial … is permissible. To allow a trial to proceed after such a finding
    would be to participate in a further violation of the <em>Charter</em>”: <em>Rahey</em></span><span
lang=EN>,</span><span lang=EN-CA> at p. 614. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>When there has been no pre-verdict delay, the conviction is not tainted
    by a <em>Charter</em> breach. The appellant is no longer presumed innocent. A
    stay of a valid conviction would impact public confidence in the administration
    of justice. As Doherty J.A. said at para. 108:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In <em>Betterman v. Montana</em>, 578 U.S. ___, 136 S. Ct.
    1609, at p. 1615, Ginsburg J., for the court, described the possibility of
    vacating a valid conviction based on sentencing delay as “an unjustified
    windfall” for the accused. That seems to me to be an accurate description. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The appropriate and just remedy here should target
    the sentence, not the conviction. The appellant was convicted of a violent
    offence against his mother in her home. It would bring the administration of
    justice into disrepute to stay the conviction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>On the other hand, delay in sentencing causes
    prejudice to the offender and to society. The offender is unable to begin
    rebuilding a life, rehabilitation is impacted, and the offender lives with the
    anxiety of an uncertain future: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Rahey </span></em><span
lang=EN>at pp. 605-06. Likewise, society “has a keen interest in ensuring that
    those guilty of committing crimes receive an appropriate sentence promptly”: </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. MacDougall, </span></em><span lang=EN>[1998] 3 S.C.R. 45, at

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>A court that imposes a sentence shall
