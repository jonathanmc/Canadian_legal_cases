  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties have a six-year-old child. She is currently living with her
    mother in the Toronto area. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The father brought an application under s. 40 of the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Children’s Law Reform Act</span></em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12<i> </i>(“<em><span
lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>”</span></em>)
    asking for a finding that the “child had been wrongfully removed to [and] was
    being wrongfully retained in Ontario”. He asked the court to order that the
    child be returned to what he claims is her habitual residence in Dubai, United
    Arab Emirates, so that all matters relating to custody and access could be
    dealt with there. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mother did not bring a counter-application. Specifically, she did
    not ask the court to exercise jurisdiction to make a custody and access order in
    Ontario. Rather, the mother opposed the father’s application on the basis that
    the child’s habitual residence has been established, by an existing consent
    court order, as “England and Wales”, United Kingdom, and that the father had wrongfully
    retained the child in Dubai. As I explain below, the mother claims that her
    decision to come to Ontario was one of necessity. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue on appeal is whether the application judge erred in ordering that
    the child be returned to Dubai.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the application judge erred in making that order. That error
    flows from her treating the father’s s. 40 <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>application (“the Application”) as if it were governed
    by the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Convention on the Civil Aspects of International
    Child Abduction, </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>Can.
    T.S. 1983, No. 35</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>(“<em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em>”).  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, stay the
    Application, and order that the father bring a similar proceeding in the court
    that issued the consent custody order.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE BACKGROUND and the consent custody order</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant mother is a Lebanese-born citizen of Lebanon and Canada.
    The respondent father is a Saudi Arabia-born citizen of Saudi Arabia and the
    United Kingdom. Their daughter was born in London, England and is a citizen of
    the United Kingdom. It does not appear to be in dispute that the child is also
    a Canadian citizen by birth. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties were married in London in the fall of 2012. Their daughter
    was born in 2013. The parties separated shortly after her birth. Extensive
    family court proceedings took place within the U.K. A custody and access order was
    issued in respect of the child, on consent, on November 25, 2015. The parties
    agree it is the last custody and access order made (“the Consent Custody
    Order”). In the Consent Custody Order, among other things, His Honour Judge
    Cryan, a judge of The Family Court at Central Family Court, in London, U.K.,
    ordered as follows: </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“[t]he child is habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and
    Wales”; and </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“<a name="_Hlk35249650">neither party shall remove the child from the
    jurisdiction of England and Wales without the written consent of the other or
    order of the court”.</a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the Consent Custody Order, the child is to live with
    the mother and the mother is to make the child available for parenting time
    with the father for two 24-hour periods and one eight-hour period each week. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father acknowledges that he started living “more substantially” in Dubai, around
    the time that the Consent Custody Order was made. Even so, he contends that he frequently
    travelled to London to retain contact with the child who was living with the mother.
    The mother says that the father was actually living more substantially in Saudi
    Arabia and that he did not come to London as often as he suggests. Regardless,
    on April 2, 2018, the mother travelled with the child to Dubai to meet the
    father. From that point forward, the parents’ narratives dramatically diverge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother maintains that she and the child went to Dubai for a two-week visit with
    the father. Although she and the child had return flights to London, Heathrow
    Airport booked for April 17, 2018, the mother contends that they never got on those
    flights because the father confiscated their passports. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother maintains that she and the child were, for all intents and purposes,
    trapped in the U.A.E. for the next almost 14 months. The mother does not speak
    Arabic and says that her repeated attempts to obtain police assistance were unsuccessful.
    On one occasion, she found the passports in the trunk of the father’s car. She
    took the child to the airport and attempted to get passes to exit the country. There
    was a waiting period to obtain the exit passes and so she hid the passports
    behind a fire extinguisher outside of her apartment. The passports were found
    by the apartment’s concierge who returned them to the father. The mother says
    that the father was furious and assaulted her as punishment for attempting to
    leave. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
    six months later, the mother maintains that she surreptitiously attended at the
    father’s home when he was in Saudi Arabia for a funeral. She says that she regained
    control of both passports and obtained the assistance of an unidentified person
    in secretly leaving the country with the child. On May 29, 2019, the mother and
    child escaped to Beirut, Lebanon. The mother says that, having been absent from
    the U.K. for so long, and not being a citizen of the U.K., she was uncertain as
    to whether she could reenter that country with the child. Accordingly, as a
    Canadian citizen, on June 9, 2019, she and the child flew to Ontario where her
    mother (the maternal grandmother) and other family members live. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father completely denies the mother’s narrative. He says that the mother and he
    agreed that she and the child would relocate to the U.A.E. so that he could be
    more actively involved in parenting the child. The father maintains that it was
    the parents’ common intention to have the child set down roots in Dubai. The
    father contends that he never stole the passports. While he may have had them
    for a while, it was for the purpose of obtaining legitimate documentation. He
    says that he never assaulted the mother. The father alleges that the mother simply
    became bitter after the child’s paternal grandparents refused to purchase her
    an expensive home in which to live. The father says that it was only after that
    decision was made, that the mother decided to abduct the child and take her to
    Canada. </p>
  <h1>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE DECISION UNDER APPEAL </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to his Application, the father argued that the child should be returned to Dubai,
    which he claims had become her habitual residence. The mother opposed the Application,
    claiming that the father had wrongfully retained the child in Dubai and that
    the child’s true habitual residence is the U.K., as legally recognized in the
    Consent Custody Order. The mother’s position is that all custody and access
    matters should be resolved in the U.K. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The parties filed extensive affidavits and the written record on the
    Application was substantial, detailed and conflicting in nature. </span>The<span
lang=EN-CA> application judge considered whether the Application could be dealt
    with on a summary basis or required a hearing with oral<i> </i>evidence. Over
    the mother’s objection, she decided the Application on the written record
    alone. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge determined that the child was habitually resident in Dubai immediately
    prior to the alleged wrongful removal to Ontario. She focused on the child’s
    life in Dubai from April 2, 2018 to May 30, 2019. She observed that the child
    first resided with both of her parents in rental accommodation and then
    primarily with her mother after her father moved to a separate apartment. Even
    so, the application judge found that the child was cared for by both of her
    parents.  She attended private school during this time, participated in
    activities, piano lessons, and horseback riding, and had a nanny and a dog.
    Extended family, including aunts and cousins as well as family friends, visited
    the parties and the child while in Dubai. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these findings, and without resolving the parents’ conflicting narratives
    about why the child was in Dubai for 14 months or the impact of the Consent
    Custody Order, the application judge concluded that Dubai was the child’s
    habitual residence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I have considered the Respondent’s argument that the child
    stayed in Dubai because the Respondent was “trapped” there by the Applicant.
    The Respondent sought to leave Dubai when her relationship with the Applicant
    did not proceed as she would have wished. <u>This does not change the fact that
    the child’s social and life connections including her community, school and
    activities were in Dubai for a fourteen-month period</u><i>.</i> The Respondent
    shipped her and [the child’s] belongings from London to Dubai in August 2018.
    [The child] was acclimatized to this jurisdiction over an appreciable period of
    time. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    concluded that the child’s habitual residence was Dubai, the application judge
    went on to consider whether the child would suffer “serious harm” if returned
    to it. She stated that this level of harm must rise to a “high threshold”.
    Relying upon <em><span lang=EN-CA>Thomson v. Thomson</span></em><i>, </i>[1994]
    3 S.C.R. 551, at p. 596, she concluded that to exempt the child from being
    returned to her habitual residence because of harm, that harm must rise to the
    level of an “intolerable situation”. Again, without resolving the conflict in
    the parties’ narratives, the application judge concluded that the mother had failed
    to meet her burden to show that level of harm. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the application judge ordered the child’s return to Dubai. She also made several
    ancillary orders, including that the father pay for the mother’s flight to the
    U.A.E. and rent an apartment for her for a period of time.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> </p>
  <h1>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with this important observation: while Canada is a signatory to the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>and s. 46 of
    the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em> makes<i> </i>its provisions the law
    of Ontario, the U.A.E. is not a signatory to the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague
    Convention</span></em>. <i> </i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father brought the Application pursuant to s. 40 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em>,
    which<i> </i>reads: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Upon application, a court,         </p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) that is <u>satisfied that a child has been

    the U.A.E. is not a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    if Article 3 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>applied, the application judge first asked where the
    child had been habitually resident just prior to her arrival in Ontario. Having
    resolved that the answer to that question was Dubai, she then asked whether the
    child would be subjected to serious harm, which she determined must rise to the
    level of an “intolerable situation”, were the child to be returned to Dubai.
    Answering that question in the negative, the application judge proceeded as if,
    pursuant to Article 12 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em>,
    she was required to return the child to Dubai.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was an error for the application judge to apply a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span

    father contends that the application judge was right to apply the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em> framework. He points to various lower
    court decisions in support of his argument that the principles governing
    applications under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>and s. 40 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>are entirely interchangeable: See e.g. <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Bolla v. Swart, </span></em>2017 ONSC 1488, at para. 38; <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Moussa v. Sundhu</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the proposition that a s. 40 <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>application is indistinguishable from a <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>application. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Recall
    the wording of s. 40 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>that is relevant to this appeal: </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>Upon application, a court, </p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(a) that is satisfied that a child has been <u>wrongfully
    removed to or is being wrongfully retained in Ontario</u>; … </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><u>may do any one or more
    of the following</u> …. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>The available remedies are: (1) making interim custody
    or access orders in the best interests of the child; (2) staying the
    application on conditions, including that a similar proceeding be promptly commenced
    in another jurisdiction; and (3) ordering the return of the child “to such
    place as the court considers appropriate”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recall,
    also, that under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i>, </i>the
    court must determine the child’s habitual residence immediately before the
    alleged wrongful removal or retention and, then, unless a specified exception
    applies, order the child’s return to the state of the habitual residence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    a plain reading of s. 40 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>and of the relevant Articles under the </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:
normal'> reveal </span></em>two fundamental differences between the two types
    of return applications: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(1) The determination of
    wrongful removal or retention is not tied to the concept of “habitual
    residence” under s. 40 of the <i>CLRA</i>. In fact, s. 40 contains no reference
    at all to the term “habitual residence”. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote>(2) If the court is
    satisfied that a child “has been wrongfully removed to or is being wrongfully
    retained in Ontario” under s. 40 of the <i>CLRA</i>, unlike under the <i>Hague
    Convention, </i>the court is given broad powers to make orders, including
    staying the application on conditions. This is in direct contrast to the <i>Hague
    Convention</i> which provides that, once there has been a determination of wrongful
    removal, subject to specified exceptions, the child must be returned to the
    state in which he or she was habitually resident.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    considerations taken into account under <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>and s. 40 <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>applications will often overlap, it is important not to
    lose sight of the fundamental differences between the applications<i>. </i>The court’s
    ability to exercise a broader range of powers under s. 40 is particularly
    important. </p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Rationale
    for the Differences Between the Schemes</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is good reason to distinguish between a return application under the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>and under
    s. 40 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>matters, it is widely recognized that, between
    contracting states, the country of habitual residence is the most appropriate
    location to determine custody and access issues. Accordingly, the purpose of
    the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>is
    to ensure that, between signatories to the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Convention</span></em>,
    there is “the prompt return of wrongfully removed or retained children to their
    country of habitual residence”: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Office of the Children’s
    Lawyer v. Balev</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black;background:white'>,
    2018 SCC 16, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 398,</span><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>at
    para. 24. The return order is not a custody determination, but an order
    designed to “restore the <em><span lang=EN-CA>status quo</span></em>” existing
    before the wrongful removal or retention and “to deprive the ‘wrongful’ parent
    of any advantage that might otherwise be gained by the abduction”: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Balev</span></em><i>, </i>at para. 24.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that a state is a signatory to the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>provides comfort about how custody and access matters
    will be dealt with by that state. By becoming a signatory to the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i>, </i>states agree to follow the
    reciprocal obligations as set out in the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Convention</span></em>.
    By virtue of signing the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i>, </i>signatories
    warrant that they are: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>[f]irmly convinced that
    the interests of children are of <u>paramount importance in matters relating to
    their custody</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>Given the paramountcy of the child’s best interests in
    custody and access decisions under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em>,<i> </i>the warranty that <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>signatories also treat the best interests of children as
    of supreme importance is critical. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    considering whether to return a child to a non-signatory state, there is no
    basis to assume that the receiving state will determine custody and access
    issues based on the child’s best interests. As noted by Laskin J.A. in <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Ojeikere v. Ojeikere</span></em><i>, </i>2018 ONCA 372, 140 O.R.
    (3d) 561, at para. 61, “[s]ome non-signatory countries may do so; others may
    not.” By way of example, in this very case, there is a significant dispute
    between the parents as to whether, in the U.A.E., considerations other than the
    child’s best interests might prevail.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the objections of the mother, the father was permitted to file expert affidavit
    evidence on the Application. The father’s expert maintains that, among other
    things, the U.A.E. court will consider what is in the best interests of the
    child. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother asks to file two expert reports as fresh evidence on appeal, both of
    which conflict with the father’s expert evidence on the Application. The father
    opposes the admission of the evidence. I would admit it. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    start with the observation that where a child’s best interests are at issue,
    the test for the admission of fresh evidence is applied more flexibly: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Ojeikere</span></em><i>, </i>at para. 47; <em><span lang=EN-CA>Salehi
    v. Tawoosi</span></em><i>, </i>2016 ONCA 986, at para. 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the time that the Application was scheduled to be heard, the mother found a
    lawyer, responded to a detailed and lengthy Application, and pulled together
    her own record which was largely based on evidence located within foreign
    countries. This was all done in circumstances where, if the mother is to be
    believed, the father had accessed her iCloud account and locked her out of it
    so that she did not have proper access to her historical electronic messages. In
    these circumstances, I accept that she acted diligently, but did not have
    enough time to obtain an expert report, particularly in the 11 days she had
    left after the father served and filed his expert’s report.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s expert reports, addressing how custody and access issues will be dealt
    with in the U.A.E., are at least as reasonably capable of belief as the
    father’s expert report. And, they could have affected the result and are
    necessary in so far as they are relevant to the child’s best interests. Therefore,
    I would admit the mother’s expert reports as fresh evidence on appeal.<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> I would also admit the father’s responding affidavit. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will not go through the experts’ reports in detail as it is not possible to
    reconcile their competing views, particularly on appeal. Suffice to say that
    the experts disagree on how custody and access issues would be dealt with if
    the child were to be returned to the U.A.E. While the father’s expert suggests
    the child’s best interests would be prioritized, the mother’s experts suggest
    otherwise. The mother’s expert reports suggest that, in any custody and access
    dispute, as a Christian, non-national, Canadian-Lebanese, non-Arabic speaking
    woman, the mother would be treated differently than the father who is a Muslim,
    non-national, Saudi Arabian-United Kingdom man. According to the mother’s
    experts, under Sharia law, the parents could be treated very differently in
    terms of their suitability as a custodial parent and, indeed, the mother’s suitability
    to even remain in the U.A.E. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    note the conflict in the experts’ reports to underscore that, when it comes to
    non-signatories of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em>, it
    cannot be presumed that the non-signatory state adheres to the fundamental
    precepts of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i>. </i> </p>
  <h1><em><span lang=EN-CA

    Application Judge ASKED the Wrong Question </span></em></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fairness to the application judge, and as pointed out by the father, I wish to
    emphasize that the application of <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>principles to non-<em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>cases is not without precedent. Even so, it was wrong to
    proceed as if this case was governed by the principles under the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em>. That error made a difference in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>cases,
    where the child’s habitual residence must be resolved, a hybrid approach is
    applied, considering both the focal point of the child’s life prior to the
    alleged wrongful removal or retention, as well as parental intention: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Balev</span></em><i>, </i>at paras. 43-46. That approach requires
    the court “look at the ‘entirety’ of [the child’s] situation”: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Farsi v. Da Rocha</span></em>, 2020 ONCA 92, at para. 41. Accordingly,
    even if this had been a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>case, the application judge would have had to grapple
    with the Consent Custody Order and the wildly different accounts of the parents
    in determining the location of the child’s habitual residence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet,
    in concluding that Dubai was the child’s habitual residence, the application
    judge did not consider the Consent Custody Order. Nor did she attempt to
    resolve the crux of the parental dispute in this case: how the child came to be
    in Dubai for over a year. Was the move from the U.K. to the U.A.E. a joint
    parental decision or was the stay in Dubai really an involuntary confinement? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of her position that they were involuntarily confined, the mother emphasizes
    that she and the child travelled on return airline tickets, returning to London
    about two weeks after their arrival in Dubai. The mother kept her flat in
    London when she travelled. The child was not withdrawn from her school in
    London before they travelled. Immediately upon their arrival in the U.A.E., the
    mother communicated with her cousin in Beirut, asking that she join them in
    Dubai. The record of that communication reveals that when the cousin asked how
    long the mother would be in the U.A.E., the mother answered that she would only
    be there until April 17<sup>th</sup>, the date coinciding with the return
    airline tickets to Heathrow. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother says that after the father took the passports, she lived in fear, and
    continues to fear, that the father would remove the child to Saudi Arabia. She
    presented documents she found stored on the father’s phone that suggest he was
    actively seeking a passport and travel permit for the child to go into Saudi
    Arabia. The mother also produced evidence from her relatives, supporting her
    position. Among that evidence was her uncle’s affidavit, suggesting that he
    spoke with the father’s parents and they wanted the child to live in Saudi
    Arabia with their other grandchildren and, in fact, were prepared to give the
    mother a “large sum of money in exchange for abandoning her daughter and
    leaving to Canada.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father says that the mother’s version of events is sheer fantasy. He likens it
    to a Hollywood movie that the mother has watched numerous times.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of his position that the parents made a joint decision to change the
    child’s habitual residence to Dubai, he relies on numerous factors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    maintains that there was never any intention for the mother and child to use
    the return airline tickets to Heathrow Airport two weeks after their arrival in
    the U.A.E. He says that he bought them return airline tickets only because they
    were cheaper than the one-way tickets he found. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
    in support of his position, the father points to emails, said to be authored by
    the mother, exploring school options for the child in Dubai, more than a year
    in advance of moving there. He points to the fact that she also travelled there
    in advance of April 2018 in order to assess the schools. He also points to
    communications between the mother and his father suggesting that she was
    planning on moving to Dubai. The mother says that the father has hijacked her
    private electronic communications and implies that he has falsified some of her
    communications. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father denies ever having been violent toward the mother. Indeed, he claims the
    opposite, that the mother is unstable and violent toward him. He claims that
    she cannot be trusted to parent the child and says she is mentally unstable. She
    claims it is he who is mentally unstable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father also points to several documents in support of his version of events,
    including placing significant emphasis on an email that the mother sent to the
    British Embassy in July 2018 (over three months after her arrival in the
    U.A.E.). He highlights the fact that the mother told the Embassy that she moved
    to Dubai so that her daughter could be closer to her father. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that other aspects of that email chain could be said to support the
    mother’s version of events, including her reference to the father having “put a
    travel ban on our daughter” and having “taken her passport from me.” The email
    also references the mother’s fear that the father would have her “arrested at
    some point and take our daughter to Saudi.” She asks the Embassy for assistance
    in obtaining a “new British citizen for my daughter as her father will not
    return the one I had. Could I pay for an original copy of her birth certificate
    to come from London? And how soon can a new passport be made?”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father also emphasizes messages said to be sent by the mother to the paternal grandfather,
    suggesting that in July 2019 (after she had arrived in Canada), the mother wished
    to return to Dubai, acknowledging she had moved there for the child “to have a
    father”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother’s and father’s accounts as to why the child was in Dubai for as long as
    she was could not be more different. Undoubtedly, it would have been difficult
    to resolve the parents’ competing accounts on the written record before the
    application judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it is important that applications arising from alleged child abductions move
    with dispatch, this cannot be done at the expense of justice. Although it will
    be a rare case in which <em><span lang=EN-CA>viva voce</span></em> evidence
    will be required, had this been a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>case, where habitual residence needed to be resolved, this
    may well have been one of those rare situations where it was necessary to hear
    some <em><span lang=EN-CA>viva voce</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>evidence: <em><span lang=EN-CA>I. (A.M.R.) v. R. (K.E.)</span></em>,<i> </i>2011 ONCA
    417, 106 O.R. (3d) 1, at para. 125;<i> </i><em><span lang=EN-CA>Dovigi v. Razi</span></em>,
    2012 ONCA 361, 110 O.R. (3d) 593, at paras. 27-28, leave to appeal refused,

lang=EN-CA> </span></i>(2006), 216 O.A.C. 78, at para. 18.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    this was not a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>case and, therefore, the application judge was not
    required to determine the question of habitual residence. She answered the
    wrong question. The “right” question did not require resolution of these facts.
     </p>
  <h1>G.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE Right Question UNDER SECTION 40(a) of the <i>CLRA</i> </h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge should have asked whether the child had been “wrongfully
    removed to or [was] being wrongfully retained in Ontario”: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>s. 40(a). A critical
    consideration in answering that question should have been the existence of the U.K.
    Consent Custody Order. That Order is not mentioned in the application judge’s analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    taking that Order into account, both parents’ versions lead to the inexorable
    conclusion that the child was wrongfully removed to Ontario. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father says that the mother abducted the child from Dubai and is now wrongfully
    retaining her in Ontario. Therefore, he says there is a wrongful removal from
    Dubai to Ontario and a wrongful retention in Ontario. His position meets the
    statutory prerequisite in s. 40(a) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the somewhat rare circumstances of this case, the mother’s position also
    amounts to an acknowledgement that there has been a wrongful removal to and
    retention in Ontario. The mother does not suggest that an Ontario court should
    take jurisdiction in relation to custody or access. Rather, the mother contends
    that the November 25, 2015 U.K. Consent Custody Order remains a binding, valid
    court order. Recall that The Family Court at Central Family Court, in London,
    U.K., ordered as follows: </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>(a)“[t]he
    child is <u>habitually resident in the jurisdiction of England and Wales</u>”;
    and </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>(b)“<u>neither
    party shall remove the child from the jurisdiction of England and Wales without
    the written consent of the other or order of the court</u>”. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother maintains that the father is in clear breach of that order, given that
    he, for all intents and purposes, confined the mother and child in Dubai by
    taking their passports and not letting them return to the U.K. at the end of
    their two-week vacation. The mother explains that she and the child are only in
    Ontario because, after the father breached the still-valid Consent Custody
    Order, and she was finally able to escape from Dubai, she did not know if she
    could return to the U.K. and stay there. While the child is a citizen of the
    U.K., the mother is only a citizen of Lebanon and Canada. Accordingly, the
    mother claims that, as a matter of necessity, and in the panic of the moment,
    she brought the child first to her family in Lebanon for a short time and then
    to her family in Ontario. She says that she deemed these to be the safest
    options. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    even though the mother provides an explanation for why she is in Ontario with
    the child, she accepts the binding nature of the Consent Custody Order. That
    order sets out the means by which the parents can remove the child from England
    and Wales: variation of the court order or written consent of the non-removing
    party. Neither of these prerequisites have been met. Therefore, even on the
    mother’s own version, and despite her reason for coming to Ontario (if
    believed), her position amounts to an acknowledgement that the Consent Custody
    Order has not been complied with. Accordingly, even on her version, there is a
    wrongful removal to and retention in Ontario. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Either
    way, whether on the father’s or the mother’s versions, the requirements of s.
    40(a) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>are
    met. </p>
  <h1>H.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE REMEDY THAT SHOULD HAVE FLOWED</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    incorrectly applying a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>framework, the application judge proceeded as if she had
    no option but to return the child to her habitual residence: Dubai. Leaving
    aside that habitual residence did not need to be decided in this Application,
    the question of remedy brings into sharp focus the second fundamental
    difference between the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>and s. 40 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i>. </i>The fact is that under s. 40, unlike under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague
    Convention</span></em><i>, </i>the court is given broad discretionary powers
    when determining what order will remedy a wrongful removal to or retention in
    Ontario. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother says that the Consent Custody Order is still valid and that the father
    must return to the U.K. to vary it. The father contends that the Consent
    Custody Order is now “obsolete”. Despite having never obtained a variation of
    the Consent Custody Order and despite neither parent having given written
    consent to the removal of the child from England and Wales, he argues that the parties
    consensually abandoned that order when they consensually moved the child to
    Dubai. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    father also contends that the mother’s failure to bring a s. 41(1) <em><span
lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>application is fatal
    to the suggestion that the U.K. Consent Custody Order governs. Section 41(1)
    reads: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><u>Upon application</u> by any person in whose favour an order for the custody of or access to a child
    has been made by an extra-provincial tribunal, <u>a court shall recognize the
    order</u> unless the court is satisfied … [emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the mother did not advance an application under s. 41(1) in the court below,
    she says that her opposition to the father’s s. 40 Application was consistent
    with s. 41(1), in the sense that the application judge should have recognized
    the U.K. Consent Custody Order as binding and the U.K. as the child’s habitual
    residence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find that the existence of the U.K. order was highly relevant to the s. 40 Application.
    While the mother could have brought a s. 41(1) application, seeking an order
    recognizing the U.K. order, the absence of that application does not neutralize
    the relevance of the U.K. order for the purposes of s. 40. Indeed, recall that
    one of the illuminating principles under s. 19 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, setting out the purposes of Part III</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>, </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>where
    s. 40 resides,</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i>is the “enforcement
    of custody and access orders made outside Ontario.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree that the Consent Custody Order is obsolete. To the contrary, it is a presumptively
    valid court order that contemplates and attempts to prevent precisely the type
    of dispute that is now before us. While I accept that the parties could change
    the child’s habitual residence under the terms of that order, it specifically
    addressed the only manner in which the parties could accomplish that end,
    either by way of “order of the court” or “written consent” of the non-removing
    party. Neither method was pursued. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, while the child had not been in the U.K. for well over a year at the
    point that the Application was determined, until she left for Dubai, she had always
    lived in the U.K. Importantly, the Consent Custody Order was informed by an
    evidentiary backdrop that would still be available in the U.K., including
    parenting assessments that had been conducted by more than one professional. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all of the circumstances, the application judge should have given substantial
    weight to the Consent Custody Order when arriving at an appropriate
    disposition. Given the highly disparate accounts of the parties, and the clear need
    to resolve those accounts before ordering the child’s return to Dubai, the
    matter should have been returned to the Central Family Court in London, U.K. for
    determination.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    U.K. is, of course, a <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hague Convention</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>signatory that subscribes to determining custody and access
    solely based on the child’s best interests. As well, allowing the father to
    pursue the matter in the U.K. would show an appropriate respect for and
    enforcement of custody and access orders made outside of Ontario. It would also
    recognize the importance of avoiding the concurrent exercise of jurisdictions
    in relation to the custody of the same child. Finally, whatever the result in
    the U.K., it would act so as to discourage child abductions as an alternative
    to the proper determination of custody rights by due process. All of these
    goals are consistent with the purposes of Part III of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>CLRA</span></em><i>, </i>which are captured in s. 19 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Act</span></em>. </p>
