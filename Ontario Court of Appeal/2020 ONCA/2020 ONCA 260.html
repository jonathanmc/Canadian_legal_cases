  <p class=Heard><b><span lang=EN-CA>Lauwers J.A.:</span></b></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Yolanda Girao, was injured in a car accident. The
    respondent, Lynn Cunningham, was at fault. The appellant claimed that her injuries
    caused her to suffer pain in her back and neck that eventually became chronic,
    and other symptoms including major depression. She claimed $500,000 in general
    damages and $500,000 in special damages. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury found the respondent to be fully liable for the accident, and
    awarded the appellant $45,000 in general damages and $30,000 in special damages
    for past loss of income. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Cunningham was represented by counsel appointed by her insurer. In
    these reasons I will occasionally refer to the respondent as the “defence” for
    convenience.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the case had gone to the jury, the defence moved to dismiss the
    action on the basis that the appellant had not met the statutory threshold to
    qualify for general damages – having sustained a serious and permanent
    impairment of important physical, mental, or psychological function under s.
    267.5(5) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8. The trial judge allowed
    the motion and dismissed the appellant’s claim for general damages. He also
    reduced her damages award for loss of income to $0 to account for statutory
    accident benefits received by the appellant from her insurer. The trial judge then
    awarded partial indemnity costs against the appellant in the amount of
    $205,542.38 plus $106,302.96 in disbursements, for a total of $311,845.34.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was self-represented at trial, as she was on the appeal.
    She used a Spanish interpreter throughout.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant set out a number of grounds of appeal on the merits in her
    notice of appeal and her supplementary notice of appeal, tangentially
    referencing the threshold motion. In her factum, she also appealed the threshold
    decision. The respondent complained about the irregular form of the appeals but
    did not claim prejudice. Making due allowance for the appellant’s status as
    self-represented, I would deem her appeal to have been properly brought on all
    these grounds.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. This is one of those
    rare civil cases in which a new trial should be ordered because “the interests
    of justice plainly require that to be done,” in the words of this court in <i>Brochu
    v. Pond</i> <span style='background:white'>(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 722</span> (C.A.), at para. 68. The appellant has shown that a “substantial wrong or
    miscarriage of justice has occurred”: s. 134(6) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 and see <i>Vokes Estate v. Palmer</i>, <span
style='background:white'>2012 ONCA 510</span>, 294 O.A.C. 342, at para. 7. </p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial Context</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant immigrated to Canada from Peru in 1999. She had been
    employed by a commercial bank in Peru and hoped to do the same work in Canada. However,
    she was unable to overcome her difficulty with the English language. She undertook
    more physical work and at the date of the accident was employed as a cleaner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant experienced a traumatic event at the age of 18 when she
    was sexually assaulted. She experienced another traumatic event at Sheridan
    College in Toronto when she was belittled by an instructor. Then came the
    accident on June 19, 2002.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant pursued statutory accident benefits under the <em>Insurance Act</em> against her insurer, Allstate, for the injuries she suffered in the accident.
    Eventually, the appellant and Allstate settled the statutory accident benefits
    claim, on February 28, 2006, for a lump sum payment of $82,300 in addition to
    all amounts which had been received by the date of the settlement. The total
    settlement included $890.64 for transportation, $6,252 for housekeeping, $91,246.24
    for income replacement, $28,360.43 for medical expenses, and $32,667.32 for
    medical rehab. The appellant’s accident benefits claim was supported by several
    expert reports, including a series of reports summarized and gathered into a
    single report by Dr. Harold Becker. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allstate’s
    considerable involvement in the action was largely driven by the groundless
    claim in Ms. Cunningham’s statement of defence, rejected by the jury, that the
    accident had been caused by an unidentified motorist. There was no evidence to
    support this claim. Ms. Cunningham refused to accept even 1 percent fault for
    the accident. The allegation in the statement of defence obliged the appellant
    to sue her own insurer Allstate in order to recover under the unidentified
    motorist endorsement in the event that the jury accepted the unidentified
    motorist claim. Allstate’s participation as a party added significantly to the
    complexity and the costs of the trial for no good purpose. While in his costs
    decision the trial judge was not unduly critical of the defence for drawing in
    Allstate by asserting the claim against an unidentified motorist, his negative view
    is shown in that he made a Sanderson Order in favour of Allstate for its costs
    of $<span style='background:white'>98,813.06</span> against the respondent. </p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>III.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The Positions of the
    Parties at Trial</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asserted that she was happy and productive before the accident. She
    was working as a cleaner. While she acknowledged the traumatic events in her
    past, she asserted that she had recovered from both before the accident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the accident the appellant claimed that she developed chronic pain and other
    symptoms, including major depression that the appellant asserts was caused by
    the accident. These injuries were acknowledged by the statutory accident
    benefits insurer and resulted in the statutory accident benefits settlement. At
    the date of the trial the appellant was on disability, receiving Ontario
    Disability Support Program (ODSP) payments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this action the appellant claimed general damages for pain and suffering and for
    economic losses that were not fully covered by statutory accident benefits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence’s position was that this was a minor motor vehicle accident not
    causally related to Ms. Girao’s physical, emotional, psychiatric, or mental
    problems. The statutory accident benefit settlement provided Ms. Girao with
    more money, over four years, than she would have earned as a cleaner, and that
    accounted for her failure to get new employment and for her approach to this
    action. Her real motive is not compensation for actual injuries caused by the
    accident but secondary gain; she is a malingerer.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    nub of the defence position was expressed in the defence’s statement, which the
    trial judge included in his charge to the jury:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>All the experts retained by Ms. Cunningham had
    denied that Ms. Girao has sustained a permanent and serious impairment that can
    be related to the June 19, 2002 motor vehicle accident, and have provided
    opinions that Ms. Girao’s depression, [temporomandibular joint] issues, chronic
    pain, and fibromyalgia claims are wholly and utterly unrelated to the accident,
    and that Ms. Girao has features of secondary gain pre-accident depression.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Even the doctors treating Ms. Girao, including
    Dr.&nbsp;Manohar, have provided the same psychiatric diagnosis of Ms. Girao in
    2012, of that of major depressive disorder with psychotic features in partial
    remission that she had in 2001 with Dr. Sanchez.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence used a three-point strategy to persuade the jury to accept the defence
    theory. First, the defence asserted and relied on the truth of psychiatrist Dr.
    Sanchez’s pre-accident letter of opinion dated October 12, 2001 concerning the
    appellant’s pre-accident state; the defence did not call Dr. Sanchez as a
    witness. Second, the defence raised and promoted the secondary gain theory using
    the statutory accident benefits settlement. Third, the defence worked to
    exclude from the jury and from the trial record the substantive expert evidence
    that justified the settlement, particularly evidence that gave a different
    portrait of the psychological effects the appellant claimed to have suffered
    from the accident than the defence’s portrayal based on the Sanchez report.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statutory accident benefits settlement was portrayed by the defence as an
    undeserved windfall. The appellant was thrust into the position of accounting
    for the settlement, said to be undeserved, but was prevented from putting
    before the jury the evidence that justified the settlement.</p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Issues</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will confine my reasons to four elements of substantial trial unfairness: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-CA>1. the preparation, content, delivery and use of the so-called
    “Joint Trial Brief”; </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2. the defence’s treatment of expert evidence; </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-CA>3. the defence’s use of information about the appellant’s accident
    benefits insurance settlement; </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-CA>4. the role of the trial judge and counsel where one party is
    self-represented.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will then consider the appellant’s challenge of the trial judge’s refusal to
    strike the jury, and conclude with the threshold decision.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the eve of trial, the defence dropped a massive and selectively redacted 16
    volume “Joint Trial Brief” on the appellant, who has substantial difficulty
    with the English language, something of which the defence was well aware. The
    content of the Brief can be summarized as falling into several categories: medical
    records, notes, and reports; employment, educational, and tax records; and documents
    relating to the collision and insurance claims. The Brief became the basis of
    the trial record in an unfair way that was inconsistent with the trial practice
    directions of this court.</p>

    paras. 127-128, and in <em>Pingue</em>, at paras. 39-40. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any
    document introduced by any party that does not become a numbered exhibit should
    become a lettered exhibit. The important distinction between numbered exhibits
    and lettered exhibits is that, subject to the trial judge’s discretion, lettered
    exhibits do not go in with the jury during its deliberations, but numbered
    exhibits do: <i>Pingue</i>, at para. 17.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a more general observation, it is customary for experts to prepare reports,
    which counsel provides to the parties and to the judge. The admissible evidence
    of the expert is normally understood to be the oral evidence, particularly in
    jury trials. However, the best practice in jury trials is to make expert
    reports lettered exhibits in order to preserve the integrity of the trial
    record for the purpose of an appeal: <i>Pingue</i>, at para. 21. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem in this case with the trial record went further. It is quite usual in
    civil actions for counsel to prepare an agreed trial document brief containing
    documents that are admitted as authentic and admissible. See J. Kenneth McEwan, <i>Sopinka on the Trial of an Action</i>, 3rd ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2016)
    at pp. 66-72. In <i>Blake v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company</i>,
    2015 ONCA 165, 331 O.A.C. 48, at para. 54, Brown J.A. emphasized the necessity
    of ensuring that the record reflects the document’s intended use:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When a document brief is tendered at trial,
    the record should reflect clearly the use the parties may make of it. Such use
    may range from the binder’s acting merely as a convenient repository of
    documents, each of which must be proved in the ordinary way, through an
    agreement about the authenticity of the documents, all the way to an agreement
    that the documents can be taken as proof of the truth of their contents. Absent
    an agreement by the parties on the permitted use of a document brief, the trial
    judge should make an early ruling about its use.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    typically agree on a list of documents and one party attends to the brief's preparation.
    As observed in <i>Iannarella</i>, at para. 128: “It is regrettably not unusual,
    however, for counsel to differ on the precise basis on which a document in the
    brief is being tendered or whether it was to have been included, as the
    implications materialize in the course of the trial.” <i>Pingue </i>stated, at
    para. 40:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]t is necessary for counsel to clarify to
    the court and to each other the extent to which the authenticity of each
    document in the proffered document brief is accepted…. If, as is too often the
    case, counsel has not done so, it is the trial judge’s responsibility to get
    the requisite clarity when the documents are made exhibits, especially
    concerning a document's hearsay content.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    discipline of judicial oversight applies even more forcefully where one party
    is self-represented and the opposing lawyer prepares the brief, and in a jury
    trial where the brief goes into the jury room. </p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Joint Document Brief was prepared by the defence without input from the
    appellant, despite the misleading label: “Joint”. There is no good explanation
    for its late delivery, which put the appellant at a disadvantage leaving her to
    run from behind through the course of the trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    volumes in the Joint Document Brief were made numbered exhibits. The trial
    judge’s approach was to simply accept all the volumes. He said, when he marked vol.
    16 as exhibit one:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[M]y assumption is for the most part, the
    documents are going to be admissible. And, rather than marking them first for
    identification and changing it, I thought I would do it the other way around.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>It does not appear from the record that the trial judge
    later excluded any documents from the Brief tendered by the defence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Becker’s report supporting the appellant’s account of her injury was initially
    made a numbered exhibit. It was later struck, but no copy was then filed as a
    lettered exhibit. This failure obliged the appellant to add it as well as some
    other reports to the appeal book in order to ensure that they were available to
    this court on the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    of the medical reports favouring the appellant’s claim in the statutory
    accident benefits file were included in the Joint Document Brief but they were redacted
    by the defence in order to excise any opinion evidence favourable to Ms.&nbsp;Girao. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not consider the flaws in the management of the trial
    record to be fatal to trial fairness in this case, but they unfairly enabled
    the defence’s strategy of keeping expert evidence favourable to the appellant
    from the jury and from the trial record. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, counsel and the court should have addressed the following questions,
    which arise in every case, in considering how the documents in the joint book
    of documents are to be treated for trial purposes: </p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Are the documents, if they are not originals,
    admitted to be true copies of the originals? Are they admissible without proof
    of the original documents?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Is it to be taken that all correspondence and
    other documents in the document book are admitted to have been prepared, sent
    and received on or about the dates set out in the documents, unless otherwise
    shown in evidence at the trial?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Is the content of a document admitted for the
    truth of its contents, or must the truth of the contents be separately
    established in the evidence at trial?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Are the parties able to introduce into evidence
    additional documents not mentioned in the document book?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Are there any documents in the joint book that a
    party wishes to treat as exceptions to the general agreement on the treatment
    of the documents in the document book?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Does any party object to a document in the document book, if it has
    not been prepared jointly?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would be preferable if a written agreement between counsel addressing these
    matters were attached to the book of documents in all civil cases. In addition,
    it would be preferable if the trial judge and counsel went through the
    agreement line by line on the record to ensure that there are no
    misunderstandings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, none of these issues or questions are novel. The answers to these
    questions are not implicit in the filing of a joint document book and must be expressly
    addressed on the record or by written agreement. The problem frequently comes
    because the parties have not turned their minds to the issues in sufficient
    detail before the document book is tendered as an exhibit. This must change as
    a matter of ordinary civil trial practice. Had the trial judge taken himself,
    counsel and Ms. Girao through this list of questions relating to the document
    book, some of the problems identified in these reasons could have been avoided.</p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Issue Two: The Use of Expert Evidence</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    issues concerning the use of expert evidence arose in this trial that are
    especially concerning. The first relates to the trial judge’s refusal to allow
    Dr.&nbsp;Becker to testify as to his opinion as to Ms. Girao’s injuries. He was
    the director of the clinic whose team members examined Ms. Girao in connection
    with her statutory accident benefits claim. Dr. Becker authored the covering
    report in which he summarized the reports of the team members, including the
    psychiatrist Dr.&nbsp;Rosenblat. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second relates to the use of Dr. Sanchez’s opinion. This was adduced by the defence
    to substantiate its theory that, before the accident, the appellant suffered
    from the same mental problems that she manifested after the accident.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    admissibility of these opinions engages two intertwined sets of governing
    principles, the first related to expert evidence, and the second to the use of ss.
    35 and 52 of the <i>Evidence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.23 to permit the
    introduction into evidence of medical reports without the need to call the
    doctors who prepared them.</p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span>The Governing Principles on
    Expert Evidence</h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    threshold requirement for the admission of expert evidence has four elements:
    the evidence must be relevant; it must be necessary in assisting the trier of
    fact; no other evidentiary rule should apply to exclude it; and the expert must
    be properly qualified, assuming there is no novel science issue. Then the trial
    judge must execute the gatekeeper function. See <i>White Burgess Langille Inman
    v. Abbott and Haliburton Co.</i>, 2015 SCC 23, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 182, at para. 19.
    See also <i>R. v. Abbey</i>, 2017 ONCA 640, 140 O.R (3d) 40, <i>per</i> Laskin
    J.A., at paras. 47-48. These four threshold elements implicitly give rise to
    another element: Can a person who has expertise, but who is not qualified as an
    expert witness under r.&nbsp;53.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O.
    1990, Reg. 194, still provide opinion evidence? </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    short answer is that such a person can give opinion evidence as this court
    affirmed in <i>Westerhof v. Gee Estate</i>, 2015 ONCA 206, 124 O.R. (3d) 721,
    leave to appeal refused, [2015] S.C.C.A. No. 198. It was a case about the
    quantum of damages for injuries suffered in a car accident. Simmons J.A. identified
    two types of witnesses with special expertise who can provide opinion evidence
    but who are not expert witnesses as described in r.&nbsp;4.1.01 and Form 53: The
    first are “participant experts,” who form opinions based on their participation
    in the underlying events, such as treating physicians. The second are
    “non-party experts,” who are retained by a non-party to the litigation and who
    form opinions based on personal observations or examinations that relate to the
    subject matter of the case, but for another purpose. One example would be a
    medical examination of a claimant for statutory accident benefit insurance
    purposes: see <i>Westerhof</i>, at para. 6. (<i>Westerhof</i> implicitly overrules
    the trial decision to the contrary reached in <i><span style='line-height:200%'>Beasley

    J.A. held, at para. 60, that both participant experts and non-party experts may
    give opinion evidence without complying with rule 53.03:</p>
  <p style='background:white'><span style='color:black'>I
    conclude that a witness with special skill, knowledge, training, or experience
    who has not been engaged by or on behalf of a party to the litigation may give

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Sanchez’s letter was adduced by the defence in order to substantiate its theory
    that the appellant was suffering before the accident from the same mental
    problems that she manifested after the accident. The defence wanted to rely on
    the words of Dr. Sanchez’s opinion as being true. This would be to use Dr.&nbsp;Sanchez’s
    statement for the truth of its content, making it hearsay evidence. Hearsay
    evidence “is presumptively inadmissible because – in the absence of the
    opportunity to cross-examine the declarant at the time the statement is made –
    it is often difficult for the trier of fact to assess its truth”: <i>R. v.
    Bradshaw</i>, 2017 SCC 35, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 865, at para. 1.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are certain exceptions to the hearsay rule under which a statement may be
    adduced for its truth value. Two such exceptions, hedged about with additional
    protections, are found in ss. 35 and 52 of the <em>Evidence Act</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    35 of the <em>Evidence Act</em> relates to business records. If a record is
    made “in the usual and ordinary course of any business and if it was in the
    usual and ordinary course of such business to make such writing or record at
    the time of such act,” then the record is admissible as evidence of such act:
    s. 35(2).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    52 of the <em>Evidence Act</em> relates to medical reports and is more
    expansive than s. 35. It permits the court to allow the report to be admitted
    into evidence without the need to call the practitioner. The opinion can then
    be accepted for the truth of its contents. However, the trial judge must, at
    the request of a party, oblige the medical practitioner to testify in order to permit
    cross-examination. See <em>Kapulica v. Dumancic</em>, [1968] 2 O.R. 438 (C.A.); <a name="_Hlk34388147"><i><span lang=EN-CA>Reimer v. Thivierge</span></i></a><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respective roles of the two sections have been distinguished in several cases. Section
    35 is not a proper basis on which to admit opinion evidence. In <i>Westerhof</i>,
    Simmons J.A. said, at para. 103: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Because these reports were tendered under s.

    Girao served a notice of intent under ss. 35 and 52 of the <em>Evidence Act</em> and listed many of her medical reports including the reports prepared by Dr.

    October 12, 2001”. Ms. Girao responded on September 20, 2011 stating that she
    “denies the facts set out in the attach [sic] report of Dr. Sanchez which are
    not accurate.” Defence counsel then served a notice under s. 35 of the <em>Evidence
    Act</em>, dated September 26, 2011, which listed several medical reports and
    which gave notice that the defence could rely on the evidence of various
    healthcare providers, including Dr. Sanchez, by either calling them to testify

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    expert evidence most favourable to the appellant was contained in the covering
    report authored by the director of the clinic, Dr. Becker, in which he
    summarized the reports of the team members who examined Ms. Girao in connection
    with her statutory accident benefits claim. The most important was a psychiatry
    report authored by Dr. Rosenblat. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge only permitted Dr. Becker to testify about the system for
    determining a person’s entitlement to statutory accident benefits for
    catastrophic impairment, but not about the substance of his report. In his jury
    charge, the trial judge effectively expunged Dr. Becker’s limited evidence,
    telling the jury that it was not in issue. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I noted earlier, the defence worked to exclude the substantive expert evidence
    that justified the statutory accident benefits settlement from the jury and
    from the trial record. Consider the positive view of Ms. Girao’s claim
    expressed by Dr. Rosenblat, whose opinion was incorporated in Dr. Becker’s
    accident benefits report: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Girao is a woman who has functioned well
    for most of her life outside of three specific areas. There is a significant
    history of a highly traumatic rape at the age of 18 from which she recovered.
    There was also a possible major depressive episode about one year prior to the
    accident from which she had full recovery. Furthermore, she had been suffering
    some back pain, again approximately a year prior to the accident. After the
    accident she developed gradually worsening bodily pains. She only began
    experiencing her depression approximately six months after the accident.
    Because her depression came on so many months after the onset of pain, it is
    clear that her pain triggered her depression and therefore her accident played
    a substantial role in precipitating her second depression. It is likely that
    her earlier rape and possible episode of depression predisposed her to the
    impact of this motor vehicle accident. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Rosenblat concluded: “Clearly this motor vehicle accident has played a
    substantial role in her current psychiatric functioning.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence did not want these opinions favourable to Ms. Girao to reach the jury.
    Dr. Becker’s report was initially admitted as exhibit 61 when it was put to Dr.
    Finkle, the defence psychiatrist, in cross-examination, but it was later
    “struck as an exhibit,” according to a note in the exhibits list. The basis on
    which the trial judge struck the exhibit has not been put before this court,
    nor was the report included in the trial record as a lettered exhibit. Ms.
    Girao included a copy in her Appeal Book. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can see no reasonable legal basis on which the evidence of Dr. Becker could be
    excluded in light of the governing principles regarding s. 52 of the <i>Evidence
    Act</i> noted earlier. It is not unusual in an assessment of a claimant for
    statutory accident benefits for there to be a summative report attaching the
    individual reports of multiple specialized assessors who prepared reports
    within their field of expertise. The usual approach would have the author of
    the summative report, in this case Dr. Becker, called as a witness by the appellant
    to provide his opinion. That is what the appellant tried to do in this case. The
    defence would have cross-examined Dr. Becker and, if necessary and if so
    inclined, the other assessors like Dr. Rosenblat, whose opinions underpinned Dr.
    Becker’s summative opinion. &nbsp;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view it was an error not to allow Dr. Becker to testify about the substance
    of his report and it was also an error to exclude his report from the record,
    given that Ms. Girao had served a notice under s. 52 of the <i>Evidence Act</i>.
    Dr. Becker should have been allowed to testify about what reliance he placed on
    Dr. Rosenblat (and others), subject to any demand by the defence to require Dr.&nbsp;Rosenblat
    to be available for cross-examination. &nbsp; </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is an actuating judicial perspective within which these principles operate,
    well-expressed by Barr J.: “[I]t should be remembered that any time a court
    excludes relevant evidence the Court's ability to reach a just verdict is
    compromised”: <i>Hunter v. Ellenberger</i><span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'> </span>(1988), 25 C.P.C. (2d) 14 (Ont. H.C.). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Allowing
    the defence experts to testify and offer opinions contrary to Dr.&nbsp;Becker

    the questioning regarding Dr. Sanchez continued, taking up several pages of the
    transcript. I interpret this exchange as Ms. Girao’s objection, as a lay
    person, to the use by the defence of the Sanchez report for the truth of its
    contents without the defence producing Dr. Sanchez as a witness in accordance
    with s. 52 of the <i>Evidence Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exchange shows the way in which making the Joint Document Brief an exhibit made
    it easy for the defence to use the evidence for its hearsay purposes. This is
    what defence counsel did with Dr. Sanchez’s report, but without calling him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span

    counsel stated that Dr. Sanchez’s report was in evidence under s.&nbsp;35 of
    the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Ontario</span> Evidence Act</em>,
    related to business records. It is also worth noting that as a result of the
    notice given by Allstate, Dr. Sanchez’s report was also in under s. 52 of the <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Ontario</span> Evidence Act</em> related to medical
    reports.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Sanchez’s report loomed large in the cross-examination of the appellant, the
    cross-examination of other medical witnesses, and in the argument.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that in his general jury instruction about medical records, the trial
    judge made comments about hearsay evidence:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[The] record makers “impression”, opinion or diagnosis
    recorded in these records, is not admissible for its truth unless the record
    maker testified before you about that opinion and you accept the evidence of

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge did not bring this caution home to the jury with respect to Dr.
    Sanchez’s opinion. His jury charge including his review of the evidence ratified
    the defence’s abuse of the opinion for hearsay purposes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <a name="_Hlk34489633">his summary of the defence position, the trial judge
    told the jury:</a></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>After the accident, Ms. Girao’s pre-existing
    mental health issues and depression continued to worsen unabated as they had
    been leading up to the accident. Ms. Girao, despite working for some time after
    the accident, then went off work and pursued litigation as a full time job and
    began receiving accident benefits payments from her accident benefits carrier,
    eventually resulting in a large settlement that paid Ms. Girao $8,000 … more
    per year by not working.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Girao’s progressive mental illness and
    psychiatric problems continued to worsen and Ms. Girao used the motor vehicle
    accident as the scapegoat of all her problems regarding her inability to adapt
    to life in Canada, her difficulties with English, her worsening pre-existing
    mental health issues, past memories and familial problems in raising her
    children.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his summary of the evidence, the trial judge made extensive reference to
    evidence about Dr. Sanchez in the appellant’s testimony in-chief and in
    cross-examination. Dr. Maliki, the appellant’s one-time family doctor who had referred
    her to Dr. Sanchez was cross-examined on his report. Dr. Sanchez’s opinion also
    came up in the evidence of the appellant’s one-time psychiatrist, Dr. Manohar,
    who testified that she was her psychiatrist from 2005 to June 2012. Dr. Manohar
    was cross-examined about Dr. Sanchez’s report. Dr. Finkle, the defence
    psychiatrist, was cross-examined by the appellant regarding Dr. Sanchez’s
    report. The trial judge’s jury instructions including his summary of the
    evidence was provided to the jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span

    cross-examination. Defence counsel then proceeded to cross-examine Ms. Girao on
    Dr. Sanchez’s opinion. He also put the opinion to several other witnesses, as
    noted earlier, and relied on it in the defence portion of the jury charge.
    Allstate used s. 52 as the basis of its notice but did not call Dr. Sanchez,
    even though the appellant had objected to his evidence.</span></em></p>

    Dr. Sanchez’s opinion. Section&nbsp;35 relates to business records and the
    ordinary notations made in such records. As the cases hold, where the report is
    that of a medical practitioner, s. 52 is applicable. But, once the plaintiff
    objected, as she did, the trial judge was required to refuse to admit Dr.
    Sanchez’s report for the truth of its contents unless he was presented for cross-examination.
    On this basis, the hearsay content of Dr. Sanchez’s opinion was not admissible
    for any purpose, yet it formed a substantial plank in the defence position, and
    was amplified in the jury instructions. This error of law was procedurally and

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statutory accident benefits settlement played an out-sized role in the defence’s
    strategy. It formed the basis of the defence’s attack on Ms. Girao’s evidence,
    her credibility and her reliability, and the credibility and reliability of the
    witnesses she called in support of her case, including the experts. Was
    evidence about the settlement properly admitted? In my view it was not, as I
    explain in this section of the reasons.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    set the context, the old law was that in a civil action a jury must be discharged
    automatically if something happened at the trial from which the jury might
    reasonably infer that the defendant was insured. The belief was that a jury
    sympathetic to the plaintiff would not hesitate to reach into the defendant’s
    insurer’s deep pocket to excessively compensate the plaintiff. The mention of
    insurance no longer necessarily results in the jury’s automatic discharge,
    because the court understands that juries share the general public awareness
    that motor vehicles are insured. See <i>Hamstra (Guardian ad litem of) v.
    British Columbia Rugby Union</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1092. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    anything, the fact the jurors are savvy about car insurance leans in the other
    direction. Jurors are aware that larger insurance awards can increase the costs
    of the car insurance premiums they pay. The Ontario Law Reform Commission noted
    that one speculative explanation for the tendency of juries to make lower
    awards than judges was “the jurors’ self-interest in keeping insurance premiums
    low”: <i>Report on the Use of Jury Trials in Civil Cases</i> (Toronto: Ontario
    Law Reform Commission, 1996), at p. 28. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    change in the judicial approach does not mean it is open season in the
    treatment of evidence about insurance in jury trials.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insurance
    defendants have seen it to their litigation advantage in some tort actions, as
    in this case, to seek to have details of the plaintiff’s previous statutory
    accident benefits settlement revealed to the jury. This has also occurred when
    the tort settlement preceded the statutory accident benefits dispute. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue is whether some or all of the details of the statutory accident benefits
    settlement can be admitted into evidence in the related tort trial arising out
    of the same accident in the examinations and cross-examinations of parties and witnesses,
    and in argument.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    courts have wrestled with this issue and the cases are mixed. Judges have been
    somewhat hesitant in admitting the evidence, recognizing the possible impact on
    the jury to the prejudice of the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin by describing the litigation dynamic set by Ontario’s system for
    compensating people injured in motor vehicle accidents. I then address the law
    of evidence in that context.</p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span

    for compensating people injured in motor vehicle accidents </span></h5>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    has a hybrid system for compensating people injured in motor vehicle accidents.
    One component is the modified at-fault tort system. The other component is the
    no-fault statutory accident benefits system. The policy basis for the hybrid
    system was explained by this court in <em>Meyer v. Bright</em> (1993), 15 O.R.
    (3d) 129, [1993] O.J. No. 2446 (C.A.), at para. 6. The plaintiff’s access to
    the at-fault tort system is limited, but the plaintiff is given access to
    no-fault accident benefits for income loss and medical and rehabilitation
    expenses. The system is based on “an exchange of rights wherein the accident
    victim loses the right to sue unless coming within the statutory exemptions,
    but receives more generous first-party benefits, regardless of fault, from his
    or her own insurer.” The system is “designed to control the cost of automobile
    insurance premiums to the consumer by eliminating some tort claims.” See also <i>Chisholm
    v. Liberty Mutual Group</i> <span style='background:white'>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d)
    776</span>, (C.A.), <i>per</i> Laskin J.A., at para. 7, and <em>Cadieux
    (Litigation Guardian of) v. Cloutier</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em>2018

    S.C.C.A. No. 63.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    intersection between the two components of the system occurs when the statutory
    accident benefits are reconciled with the award of tort damages under s. 267.8
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>. Although the two sources of compensation are
    independent, there is some overlap and s. 267.8 is intended to prevent double
    recovery by the plaintiff. The functioning of the system is explained in <i>Cadieux</i> at paras. 22-24. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted in <i>Basandra v. Sforza</i>, <span style='color:windowtext;background:

style='background:white'>130 O.R. (3d) 466, </span></span><span
style='background:white'>at para. 21, affirmed in <i>Cadieux</i>, the statutory
    scheme sets up benefits silos: “</span>Section 267.8 of the <i>Insurance Act </i>creates
    several categories of statutory accident benefits to be taken into account as
    possible reductions in a jury award: [the first silo is] income loss and loss
    of earning capacity (s. 267.8(1)); [the second silo is] health care expenses,
    which includes attendant care costs by definition under s. 224(1) of the Act
    (s. 267.8(4)); and [the third silo is] other pecuniary losses such as
    housekeeping costs (s. 267.8(6)).” The tort award is to be reduced by the
    amount of statutory accident benefits received by the plaintiff on the basis of
    these three silos. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reconciles the no-fault benefits received by the plaintiff with the
    award of tort damages after the jury’s damages verdict by reducing the tort
    award: <i>Basandra</i>, at para. 20. The jury has no role in this exercise. The
    practice in civil jury trials is to include a jury instruction that they are to
    “make their award, if any, on a gross basis with no deduction for any
    collateral benefits” on the basis that the trial judge will make any required adjustment: <em>Malfara v. Vukojevic</em>, 2014 ONSC 6604, at para. 1, <i>per</i> Firestone

  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span

  <p class=BContinuingPara>[91]<span

    is trite law that evidence is admissible if it is relevant to a fact in issue
    in the case and is not subject to an exclusionary rule. The trial judge also
    has discretion to refuse to admit evidence where its prejudicial effect would
    exceed its probative value: <em>Draper v. Jacklyn</em> (1969), [1970] S.C.R.
    92. That case involved graphic photographs of a motorist’s injuries that were
    admitted at trial. While holding that the photographs were properly admitted,
    Spence J. said at p. 98: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The occasions are frequent upon which a judge
    trying a case with the assistance of a jury is called upon to determine whether
    or not a piece of evidence technically admissible may be so prejudicial to the

    and that therefore he should exclude the production of the particular piece of
    evidence.</span></p>

  <p class=BContinuingPara>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    limited case law shows that defendants have pursued several avenues to argue
    that the details of the statutory accident benefits settlement are relevant in
    the tort action and should be revealed to the jury.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    less contentious avenue has been to allege the plaintiff’s failure to use the

  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
style='color:windowtext'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <em>Farrugia</em>, the trial judge did not permit the defence
    to reveal the totality of the settlement to the jury but did permit questions
    on several benefits on the basis that the pleadings had put them in dispute. He
    permitted questions on caregiver expenses, attendant care expenses, and
    housekeeping and home maintenance expenses: at para. 29. The plaintiff had used
    some of the proceeds to renovate her house.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Peloso</i>, the trial judge permitted the defence to ask questions about the
    plaintiff’s lack of compliance with treatment recommendations on the basis of
    the allegation that she had failed to mitigate her future losses. Instead of
    using the money for the recommended treatments, the plaintiff bought a house.
    The trial judge reduced the damages 30 percent for the plaintiff’s failure to
    mitigate: at para.&nbsp; 377.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    more contentious avenue has been to claim that the benefits settlement eroded
    the plaintiff’s motivation to work, thereby increasing the future income losses
    the defendant will be required to pay through the tort award. This avenue has
    been rejected by trial judges on the basis of relevance, as in <em>Ismail v.
    Flemming</em>, 2018 ONSC 5979, or on the basis that it was excessively
    prejudicial to the plaintiff, as in <i>Farrugia</i>, which I consider in the
    next section</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In<i> Ismail</i> the
    trial judge granted an order prohibiting questions by the defence as to “any
    suggestion, submission, argument or other reference at trial to the effect that
    the receipt of collateral benefits is relevant to [the plaintiff’s] motivation
    to work”: at para. 37. He acknowledged, at para. 17, that “there was an
    intuitive logic to the defendants' contemplated line of questioning and
    argument, and their corresponding assertions of relevance,” but he largely
    rejected that logic, relying in part on the trial and appellate decisions in <i>Kitchenham
    v. AXA Insurance</i>, 23 C.C.L.I. (4<sup>th</sup>) 76 (Ont. S.C.), rev’d on
    other grounds, 229 O.A.C. 249 (Div Ct.), rev’d on other grounds, 2008 ONCA 877,

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span

    that the plaintiff could work, which would have reduced the carrier’s liability
    to pay income replacement benefits, alleging that the plaintiff, having been
    enriched by the tort settlement, lacked the financial incentive to work. The
    motion judge in <i>Kitchenham</i> said, at para. 53, that “documents relating
    to the settlement of the tort claim have no relevance to the present
    proceedings,” and refused to order the production of the tort settlement
    documents. His view on this issue was accepted by the Divisional Court and by
    this court. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge in <i>Kitchenham</i> explained, at para. 52:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The best that [the defendant insurer] could do
    was to suggest that the quantum of the settlement might affect the plaintiff’s
    motivation to return to work. <u>However, the issue to be determined at trial
    is whether or not the plaintiff is disabled from working, not whether the
    plaintiff has a financial incentive to work</u>. A wealthy person might have no
    incentive to work at all, yet would still be entitled to loss of income
    benefits if he were disabled from doing so. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doherty J.A. agreed
    with the motion judge and noted, at para. 14:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The issue in the benefits action is whether
    the plaintiff is disabled and unable to work. The impact, if any, of the
    settlement in the tort action on the plaintiff’s motivation to work and the
    extent to which the plaintiff is actually disabled are both so speculative as
    to be beyond even the generous notion of relevance applied at this [discovery]
    stage of a proceeding[.]</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in <i>Ismail </i>found, at para. 32, that <i>Kitchenham</i> applied in principle whether the
    tort settlement came first or the statutory accident benefits settlement. He
    prohibited the defence from making any<span style='line-height:200%'> </span>suggestion
    that the receipt of collateral benefits affected the plaintiff’s motivation to
    work. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence argues that the <i>Ismail</i> trial judge’s reliance on <i>Kitchenham </i>was
    misplaced; it is distinguishable because it was a benefits action, not a tort action
    like this case. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a basic difference between benefits actions like <i>Kitchenham </i>and tort
    actions like <i>Ismail</i>. In tort actions the statutory accident benefits
    must be accounted for in the final tort award under the<i> Insurance Act.</i> The same is not true for benefits actions in which there is no direct
    relationship between the tort settlement and the benefits settlement. That
    said, they are similar from the perspective of the trier of fact, for whom, as
    Doherty J.A. stated in <i>Kitchenham</i>: “The issue in the benefits action is
    whether the plaintiff is disabled and unable to work.” That is a substantive
    issue in tort actions including this one; motivation to work is relevant to credibility
    but credibility is a collateral and testimonial issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence submits
    that the governing authority is <i>McLean v. Knox</i>, 2013 ONCA 357, 306
    O.A.C. 203, which effectively elevated the plaintiff’s credibility to the
    equivalent of a fact in issue of substantive relevance. In my view, this submission
    overstates the effect of<i> McLean.</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='color:windowtext'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>McLean</i> the plaintiff was a passenger injured in a car
    accident in which the driver was intoxicated. He sued the driver and the bar
    that overserved him. The jury awarded the plaintiff general damages but did not
    award him anything for future income loss. The trial judge set aside the jury’s
    verdict on future income loss and substituted his own award of $117,200. This
    court allowed the bar’s appeal. Gillese J.A. noted, at para. 24, that “it
    cannot be said that there was no evidence on which the jury could reject a
    claim for future income loss.” To the contrary, she found, at para. 23: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There was evidence that the plaintiff earned
    as much income, or more, following the accident as he had earned before the accident.
    Also, the plaintiff suffered from serious credibility issues in respect of his
    income and his motivation to work. In addition, there was evidence that the
    plaintiff had alternative job opportunities available to him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This sets the context for the sentence on which defence counsel
    relies, in para. 24: “</span>Even assuming that the defence evidence on the
    plaintiff's injuries was ‘uncontradicted and uncontested’, as the trial judge
    found, that evidence was not determinative of the question of future income
    loss - <u>credibility and motivation to work were also relevant to such a
    determination</u>” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would not give effect to the respondent’s argument regarding the effect of <i>McLean</i> for two reasons: First,<i> McLean </i>did not elevate the plaintiff’s credibility
    to the equivalent of a fact in issue of substantive relevance. This is not the
    jurisprudential point on which the case turned. The court was not expressing a
    general principle of broad application, but was merely commenting on the actual
    evidence in the case. The defence adduced positive evidence showing that the
    plaintiff earned more after the accident than before and that he had other job
    opportunities he had not taken. No doubt the plaintiff did not fare well in
    cross-examination in light of that evidence, hence the reference to his poor credibility.
    Even with his acknowledged injuries, the jury did not believe that he was
    unable to work because he had been working.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the court in <i>McLean</i> was not using
    the word “relevant” in the sense of specifying a norm for future cases </span>but
    as a description of the plaintiff’s failure to establish the credibility of his
    claim to be unable to work.<u> </u></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, a plaintiff’s motivation to work is a collateral
    issue related to the credibility of the assertion that she or he is unable to
    work. How much evidence will be permitted on the issue of the plaintiff’s
    alleged malingering or motivation to work is a matter for the trial judge’s
    discretion in considering the balance of prejudicial effect and probative
    value, to which I now turn.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The prejudicial effect/probative value balance</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second question in
    the admissibility of evidence is whether its prejudicial effect would exceed its
    probative value. In <i>Farrugia</i>, the defendants argued that the plaintiff
    had misspent the proceeds of her statutory accident benefits settlement.
    Because she could have used the funds to reduce her future losses, she had
    failed to mitigate the damages she sought in the tort action. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge
    refused to allow the total amount of the settlement to be revealed to the jury
    but did allow evidence about certain components of the settlement to be adduced,
    for two reasons. First, he pointed to reasoning prejudice that disclosure of
    the total settlement could create in the minds of the jury. He found, at para.
    27, that questions on the totality of the settlement “would create a
    prejudicial effect in the minds of the jury that would exceed the probative
    value of those questions, as would any answer as to the receipt of those funds
    or the use to which they were put.” He added that: “This prejudicial effect
    would be all the more pronounced because of the lack of materiality for asking
    those questions in the first place.”</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial
    judge in <i>Farrugia</i> pointed to the unfairness of the position in which the
    plaintiff would be left as a form of “double jeopardy.” He noted, at para.&nbsp;28: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, permitting a question about the
    totality of the accident benefits settlement received and any related question
    would expose Ms. Farrugia to double jeopardy. She would be subject to the
    impact of both the prejudicial effect of that question, as well as the fact
    that the very same accident benefits will be deducted under the <i>Insurance Act</i>,
    where applicable, from any award the jury makes.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge in <i>Farrugia </i>assessed relevance against the pleading. In his view it “was overly broad
    and failed to provide any other basis to establish how such a question would be
    relevant”: at para. 27. He did permit limited cross-examination, as I will
    explain.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the same vein, while the trial judge in <i>Ismail</i>, at para. 10, cited <i>McLean
    v. Knox</i>, he then pointed out, at para. 33, that the defence’s challenge was
    not focussed on preventing double recovery, but on “quite a different purpose”,
    being to form the “basis for suggesting that the plaintiff is not really
    disabled, but effectively choosing not to work because her receipt of
    collateral benefits undermines her motivation to work.” This he saw as a
    purpose related purely to credibility.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ismail</i>, the
    trial judge canvassed several policy considerations implicated by the
    suggestion that the plaintiff was not actually disabled but rather lacked the motivation
    to work because she had received statutory accident benefits. Noting the
    statutory entitlement to no-fault benefits and the fact that most people
    injured in a motor vehicle accident would claim them, the trial judge said, at
    para. 34: “In my view, use of collateral entitlements premised on <i>disability</i> to support arguments of <i>ability</i>, in order to undermine residual claims
    for recovery not addressed by such collateral benefits, seems not only ironic
    but unfair.” He cautioned that such an argument could be made “in every case
    where a plaintiff has received collateral benefits, regardless of idiosyncratic
    concerns about credibility.” He worried that this avenue of attack could create
    a perverse incentive under which, in order “to avoid having their legitimate
    and possibly greater claims for future income loss being compromised,”
    plaintiffs “legitimately disabled by motor vehicle accidents, and unable to
    work, [would] … refrain from aggressively pursuing all collateral benefits
    otherwise properly available to them.”</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Credibility</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several decisions have
    highlighted the plaintiff’s credibility as the basis for allowing full
    exploration of the benefits settlement by the defence. It is fair to say that
    credibility is often especially in issue when the plaintiff’s complaint relates
    to soft tissue injuries or to the psychological effects of a motor vehicle
    accident that lack objective markers. See for example <i>Djermanovic v.
    McKenzie</i>, 2014 ONSC 1335, 32 C.C.L.I. (5th) 96, at para. 40.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can the holdings from <i>McLean</i> and <i>Kitchenham</i> be reconciled? I do not read them to be inconsistent. <i>Kitchenham </i>identified the substantive fact in issue as the plaintiff’s ability to
    work. <i>McLean</i> noted that the plaintiff’s credibility in asserting the
    inability to work can be tested with positive evidence and in cross-examination
    leading to the jury finding the plaintiff not to be credible. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The core issue is
    whether the plaintiff is able to return to work, not the motivation to work, as
    Doherty J.A. noted in <i>Kitchenham</i>. The plaintiff’s burden is to prove his
    or her inability to work. The defence asserts that the plaintiff is able to
    return to work. Typically, the evidence will involve a physical examination of
    the plaintiff including medical reports, a psychological examination where
    psychological injury is alleged, the testimony of other witnesses, evidence
    such as surveillance showing the plaintiff doing something he or she claimed
    not to be able to do, and effective cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Motivation to work is
    a collateral issue that the defence can raise in cross-examination to test the
    plaintiff’s credibility as to why he or she is not working. Can evidence in the
    form of the details of the benefits settlement be used in the plaintiff’s
    cross-examination?</p>

    It follows that if on cross-examination a witness is asked questions by opposing
    counsel solely with a view to attacking the credibility of that witness, any

  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Emerging Principles</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several principles emerge
    from this discussion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the trial judge
    has broad discretion to control the proceedings to ensure that trial fairness
    results. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Ontario’s
    hybrid motor vehicle accident compensation system has as its primary concern
    the adequate compensation of injured persons. The reconciliation of benefits
    and tort damages aims to prevent double recovery. As noted, the practice in
    civil jury trials is to include an instruction to the jury to make their award
    of damages on a gross basis with no deduction for any collateral benefits. The
    reconciliation of the receipt of benefits and tort damages is not expected to
    be controversial in most instances. The task is left to the trial judge in
    order to take it out of contention before the jury. Perhaps that statutory
    allocation of responsibility to the judge reflects a recognition that the jury
    might otherwise be tempted to do some informal discounting of the damages award
    to take account of the statutory accident benefits the plaintiff has already
    received.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, it falls to the
    trial judge in a tort action to decide contextually whether and to what extent
    evidence about the statutory accident benefits settlement is to be admitted.
    The principles of evidence law guide the decision. The first question is
    whether evidence of the details or existence of the statutory accident benefits
    settlement is relevant to a fact in issue in the tort action. The second
    question is whether the probative value of the evidence would exceed its
    prejudicial value. Striking the balance engages the trial judge’s discretion.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, evidence
    regarding some of the individual benefits received in the statutory accident
    benefits settlement would be relevant and admissible if the allegation is made
    that the plaintiff’s abuse of a benefit will have an impact on the calculation
    of the tort damages. For example, if the defence pleads that the plaintiff
    failed to use the earmarked settlement proceeds to mitigate certain related
    future losses, as in <em>Farrugia </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>and</span> Peloso</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, then certain details of a
    settlement will be directly relevant to whether the defendant or the plaintiff
    is liable to the future losses. </span></em>The plaintiff is free to use
    proceeds of a settlement as he or she sees fit, but in some circumstances it is
    appropriate to require the plaintiff to account for the expenditure of
    settlement funds.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a two-fold
    proviso: the pleadings must have put the issue into dispute with appropriate
    particularity; and there must be an air of reality to the issue, to be assessed
    in a <i>voir dire</i>, which is supported by evidence and admissible expert
    evidence if necessary. In my view, the same proviso would apply to a defence
    allegation that the plaintiff is malingering or lacks the motivation to work. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Fifth, the totality
    of the statutory accident benefits settlement would rarely be relevant and
    would usually be more prejudicial than probative, particularly in a jury trial,
    even when the defence alleges that the plaintiff is malingering or lacks the
    motivation to work. These allegations are easy to make and difficult for the
    plaintiff to defuse. The plaintiff’s burden to prove his or her inability to
    work is especially heavy for soft tissue injuries, chronic pain, and
    psychological injury such as depression where objective evidence is lacking.
    The accusation of malingering prejudicially adds to the plaintiff’s evidentiary
    burden by sowing suspicion in the minds of the jury. The accusation of
    malingering can form the basis of withering cross-examination of the plaintiff
    and allow counsel to repeat the malingering accusation in the examination and
    cross-examination of other witnesses. In this way, the allegation of
    malingering can achieve narrative heft by repetition as a mnemonic reminder to
    the jury of the defence’s theory. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth, there are
    public policy grounds for being cautious. Permitting the benefits settlement to
    undermine the tort claim can expose the plaintiff to unfairness, as Leitch J.
    noted in <i>Ismail</i>, at para. 34, which I repeat for convenience: the “use
    of collateral entitlements premised on <i>disability</i> to support arguments
    of <i>ability</i>, in order to undermine residual claims for recovery not
    addressed by such collateral benefits, seems not only ironic but unfair.” In <i>Farrugia</i>,
    Emery J. called it a form of double jeopardy. I agree with their observations.
    Further, making the evidence of statutory accident benefits settlement
    generally admissible in tort actions can create a perverse incentive on the
    plaintiff to keep the statutory accident benefits claim alive so that it does
    not become a defence weapon in the tort action. However, it is a general
    principle of our law that settlements are to be encouraged, not discouraged. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, where
    evidence of the statutory accident benefits settlement is in evidence before
    the jury, the jury instructions should carefully explain how the motor vehicle
    accident compensation system in Ontario functions, including the fact that the
    plaintiff was entitled to the statutory accident benefits, and the distinct
    roles of the trial judge and the jury in setting the tort damages and
    accounting for benefits received so that the jury can understand the reasons
    for the allocation of the roles. The jury should be instructed not to reduce
    the award of damages because it believes that the benefits have compensated the
    plaintiff adequately for the accident. The current rather sparse standard
    instruction is not adequate.</p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view Ms. Girao’s
    trial did not satisfy most of these principles. I address them in the same
    order as the previous section.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> First, the trial
    judge in this case gave the standard instruction to the jury and the defence
    argues that nothing more was required of him. I disagree for the reasons set
    out earlier. The prejudice of introducing evidence of a statutory accident
    benefits settlement must be carefully balanced against its probative value. The
    current practice of requiring the jury to establish damages on a gross basis,
    while leaving the trial judge the task of giving credit for benefits received,
    does not stop the jury from falling prey to reasoning prejudice.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the record
    before this court does not show the trial judge’s reasoning process on
    admitting the statutory accident benefits settlement documents: the rationale
    for their admission based on relevance or the prejudicial effect/probative
    value balance is therefore not evident from the record. The trial judge
    permitted the defence to rely on the settlement and to cross-examine Ms.&nbsp;Girao
    on it. The settlement documents and details were included in volume 16 of the
    joint trial brief, which was slipped in as the first trial exhibit on the first
    day of the trial. Ms. Girao did not object to the admission of this material,
    probably because she did not know that she could.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, unlike <i>Ferrugia</i>, <i>Ismail</i> and <i>Peloso</i>, there was no clear basis on which the details
    of the benefits settlement should have been admitted. There is nothing in the
    statement of defence that put the benefits settlement in issue. In my view,
    there was no basis upon which to admit the evidence of Ms. Girao’s statutory
    accident benefits settlement or to allow the defence to cross-examine Ms. Girao
    on its details. Based on the pleadings, nothing in the cross-examination was
    relevant to a material fact at issue. </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth,
    the defence sought to reveal the total benefits settlement to the jury in order
    to underpin the assertion that Ms. Girao was malingering and unmotivated to
    work.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As previously noted,
    in his summary of the defence position, the trial judge told the jury in his
    charge: “Ms. Girao, despite working for some time after the accident, then went
    off work and pursued litigation as a full time job and began receiving accident
    benefits payments from her accident benefits carrier, eventually resulting in a
    large settlement that paid Ms. Girao $8,000 … more per year by not working.” </p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defence alleged
    that Ms. Girao’s health issues were wholly unrelated to the accident and that her
    claim had features of “secondary gain”. In oral argument, counsel for the
    respondent agreed that the defence claim was essentially that Ms. Girao was
    malingering. He asserted that malingering was a psychological diagnosis
    according to the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>,
    5th ed., issued by the American Psychiatric Association, (Washington DC:
    American Psychiatric Publishing, 2013). The DSM-V identifies malingering as a
    “condition,” not a “disorder,” at p. 726-727. That would make all trial
    questions regarding the influence of the statutory accident benefits settlement
    relevant. However, neither the statement of defence nor the factum before this
    court identified Ms. Girao’s alleged malingering as an issue.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
    transcript reveals that the whole thrust of the cross-examination was to
    portray the settlement as an unearned windfall to which Ms.&nbsp;Girao wanted
    to add another unearned windfall: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Defence Counsel: Okay. So, using this simple
    math, ma’am, you acknowledge you were paid $85,000 by Allstate from 2002

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Girao: Yes.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Defence Counsel: Right. You started receiving
    $21,000 a year from ODSP. Correct?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Girao: That’s correct.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Defence Counsel: So, ma’am, from 2002 through
    to, at least, 2006, you didn’t have to work because you were getting more money
    from your accident benefit carrier than you were cleaning toilets in a building
    and working 40 hours a week. Yes?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Girao: Yes.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Defence Counsel: Yes. And, then from 2008 up
    until the present day, you don’t have to work either because you’re getting all
    that money from ODSP, which is more than you’d make if you were cleaning
    toilets again. Correct?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Girao: Well, just by the way, cleaning
    toilets, it’s not something that someone should be ashamed of. It’s a dignified
    piece of work. Okay?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the pleadings
    and the material facts at issue, there was minimal, if any, probative value in this
    mocking and belittling cross-examination on the benefits settlement. It was
    highly prejudicial to Ms. Girao, having the perverse effect identified in <i>Ismail </i>of using “<span lang=EN-CA>collateral entitlements premised on <i>disability</i> to support arguments of <i>ability</i>”. The trial judge did nothing.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Morwald-Benevides
    v. Benevides</i>, 2019 ONCA 1023, 148 O.R. (3d) 305, I surveyed some of the
    responsibilities that trial judges have to self-represented litigants, and
    noted, at para. 34: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is no longer sufficient for a judge to
    simply swear a party in and then leave it to the party to explain the case,
    letting the party flounder and then subside into unhelpful silence. As this
    court has noted, “it is well-accepted that trial judges have special duties to
    self-represented litigants, in terms of acquainting them with courtroom procedure
    and the rules of evidence”:&nbsp;<i>Dujardin v. Dujardin</i>, 2018 ONCA 597,
    423 D.L.R. (4th) 731, at para. 37, repeated in&nbsp;<i>Gionet v. Pingue</i>,
    2018 ONCA 1040, 22 R.F.L. (8th) 55, at para. 30. The court added, at para. 31
    of&nbsp;<i>Gionet</i>: “In ensuring that a self-represented litigant has a fair
    trial, the trial judge must treat the litigant fairly and attempt to
    accommodate their unfamiliarity with the trial process, in order to permit them
    to present their case”, citing&nbsp;<i>Davids v. Davids&nbsp;</i>(1999), 125
    O.A.C. 375, at para. 36. See also&nbsp;<i>Manitoba (Director of Child and
    Family Services) v. J.A.</i>, 2006 MBCA 44, at paras. 19-20.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although fairness
    concerns may animate how a trial judge exercises control over their courtrooms,
    there are clear limits to a trial judge’s duty to assist a self-represented
    litigant. The actuality and the appearance of judicial impartiality must be
    maintained. <span lang=EN-CA>As Brown J.A. said in&nbsp;<i>Sanzone v. Schechter</i></span>,
    2016 ONCA 566<span lang=EN-CA>,&nbsp;</span>402 D.L.R. (4th) 135<span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 22: “A defendant is entitled to expect that a claim of
    liability brought against it will be decided by the same rules of evidence and
    substantive law whether the plaintiff is represented by counsel or
    self-represented.” In order to preserve fairness in a trial, “the trial judge
    must, of course, respect the rights of the other party”: <i>Davids</i>, at
    para. 36.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning now to
    counsel’s duties as officers of the court. I note that the professional ethical
    obligations of a lawyer toward a self-represented litigant is fairly limited under
    the Law Society of Ontario’s <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i>: see Law
    Society of Ontario, <i>Rules&nbsp;of&nbsp;Professional&nbsp;Conduct</i>,

    have more general ethical obligations when acting as an advocate, such as the
    duty to bring to the court’s attention any binding authority that the lawyer
    considers to be directly on point that has not been mentioned by an opponent:

    There is no need to repeat them. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case the
    defence advanced evidentiary positions that were problematic on legally complex
    topics. In advancing those positions, the defence ought to have assisted the
    trial judge, as officers of the court, with the legal issues embedded in the
    positions. Ms. Girao needed the active assistance of the trial judge to deal
    with those positions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In my view, it was open to the trial judge faced with a
    legally contentious issue to require counsel to assist. In this trial, for
    instance, the trial judge could have asked for a briefing note on the interplay
    of ss. 35 and 52 of the <em>Evidence Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> in relation to the medical evidence, including the relevant authorities. The
    same would apply to the introduction of the evidence of the totality of the
    statutory accident benefits settlement on which there are several relevant
    cases. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The impression left by
    the limited trial record is that the trial judge allowed himself to be led by
    trial counsel’s arguments. Ms. Girao, a self-represented, legally
    unsophisticated plaintiff who struggled with the English language, was left to
    her own devices. Fairness required more, consistent with the expectations
    placed on the trial judge by <i>Statement of Principles on Self-represented

    v. Balac</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 660,
    leave to appeal refused, [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 496. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent relies
    on the premise underlying these decisions: “[T]he moving party has a
    substantial onus because trial by jury is a fundamental right”: <em>McDonald-Wright
    v. O’Herlihy</em>, 2007 ONCA 89, <span lang=EN-CA>220 O.A.C. 110, </span>at
    para. 13, <i>per</i> Gillese J.A., who cited <em>Hunt (Litigation Guardian of)
    v. Sutton Group Incentive Realty Inc.</em> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 665 (C.A.). The
    respondent also relies on <i><span lang=EN-CA>McDonald-Wright </span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>to support her position that the trial judge did not err in
    declining to strike the jury</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To paraphrase several
    principles invoked by Epstein J.A. in <em>Kempf</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'>, at para.&nbsp;43 (5) and (7)</span></em>: Complexity of a case is a
    proper consideration in determining whether a jury notice should be struck, and
    that relates not only to the facts and the evidence, but also to the legal
    principles that apply to the case. Trial judges are presumed to know the law
    and to be able to explain it to a jury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Kempf</i>, at
    para. 119, Laskin J.A. said: “The question for the trial judge is simply this:
    will <a name="_Hlk34904107">justice to the parties be better served by
    dismissing or retaining the jury?</a>” This standard has been cited in numerous
    cases: see e.g. <i>Cowles</i>, at para.&nbsp;37; <i>Graham v. Rourke</i> (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 622, [1990] O.J. No. 2314, at para. 6. In <i>Graham</i>,
    Doherty J.A. continued at para. 6: “In many situations that discretion may,
    with equal propriety, be exercised for or against discharging the jury.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Laskin J.A. further
    pointed out in <em>Kempf</em>, at para. 119, in assessing whether a trial judge
    exercised discretion appropriately about whether to retain or discharge a jury,
    “context matters. Although the right to a trial by jury in a civil case is an
    important right, it is far from absolute.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One contextual issue
    clearly at play with respect to Ms. Girao is the degree to which, if at all, a
    trial judge should consider a party’s self-represented status, among other
    factors, when determining whether to strike a jury. I addressed this issue in
    the immediately preceding section of these reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[165]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cases in which the
    principles have been expressed have tended to be family law cases in which
    there is no jury. But there are cases in which a party’s self-represented
    status was a factor considered by the trial judge in determining whether to
    strike a jury notice. In <i>Desjardins v. Arcadian Restaurants Ltd.</i> (2005),
    77 O.R. (3d) 27 (Ont. S.C.), the defendant filed a jury notice but then later
    brought a motion to strike the jury several months before trial. The
    self-represented plaintiff opposed the motion. The motion judge initially
    dismissed the motion to strike without prejudice to the defendant on the belief
    that “with proper instructions to the plaintiff and to the jury, [he] would be
    able to manage the trial in a manner that would be perceived by the jury to be
    fair to both sides”: at para. 12. However, he left it open to the defendant to
    renew the motion at trial. When the defendant renewed the motion closer to
    trial, the motion judge granted the motion to strike the jury notice, noting
    that the self-represented status of the plaintiff has made the case “unduly
    complicated” so that the trial would be prolonged as a result: at para. 11(i)
    and (ii). He explained: “I have now come to the conclusion that it will <span
lang=EN-CA>virtually be impossible to provide the assistance I anticipate the
    plaintiff will require at trial in a manner that ensures that the defendant
    will not be placed at a significant disadvantage in the eyes of the jury”: </span>at
    para. 13. See also <i>Belende c. Greenspoon</i>, 2006 Carswell 9135. </p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied</span></h5>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case involved
    medical evidence that was not markedly different from the factual issues and
    legal principles routinely handled by juries in cases involving motor vehicle
    accidents and medical malpractice. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent relies
    on <em>McDonald-Wright</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, but I note </span></em>Gillese
    J.A.’s statement, at para. 15:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also considered the character
    of the jury and concluded that the jurors were dedicated, took their
    responsibilities seriously and <u>had the benefit of experienced counsel who
    knew their cases thoroughly and were exceptionally skilled at presenting
    evidence before a jury</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>This excerpt identifies one of the critical elements
    missing from this jury trial: the presence on both sides of experienced
    counsel. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The presence of a jury
    might well inhibit a trial judge in providing assistance to a self-represented
    litigant. In both <i>Desjardins </i>and <i>Belende</i>, the self-represented
    status of the plaintiff was clearly a significant factor that weighed in favour
    of striking the jury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a case where
    the trial judge should have reconsidered his decision not to strike the jury as
    the trial unfolded and difficulties in trying this case fairly mounted through
    the long days of the trial. </p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was self-represented and did not
    know the law. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She was testifying and conducting
    cross-examinations through an interpreter and the transcript excerpts in the
    appeal record show that difficulties occurred from time to time as the evidence
    unfolded. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She faced two sets of experienced and highly
    active jury counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the defence objected to a question or a
    statement made by Ms. Girao, as it frequently did, the jury had to be taken out
    so that argument could take place and appropriate instructions given, usually
    to her. This added to the trial time and to the frustrations of all involved,
    and likely to Ms. Girao’s detriment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the
    self-represented status of a litigant is a factor that might unduly complicate or
    lengthen the trial, leading the trial judge to conclude that prudence suggests
    the jury be discharged. As noted by Epstein J.A. in <i>Kempf</i>, “in many
    cases the ‘wait and see’ approach is the most prudent course to follow”: at
    para. 43 (9). As the trial unfolds, the trial judge becomes better able to
    assess the capacity of the self-represented party to present the case, whether
    as a plaintiff or a defendant. While remaining mindful of the substantive but
    not absolute right to a trial by jury, the trial judge then is positioned to determine
    whether justice to the parties would be better served by dismissing or
    retaining the jury. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While I recognize that
    the right to a jury trial in a civil action has been recognized as fundamental,
    it is not absolute and must sometimes yield to practicality. I should not be
    understood as stating that the presence of a self-represented litigant should
    invariably lead to the dismissal of a civil jury. In many if not most cases, a
    trial judge should be able to fairly manage a civil jury trial with a self-represented
    litigant, with the willing assistance of counsel acting in the best traditions
    of officers of the court. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the trial
    judge erred in failing to revisit his decision not to strike the jury.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>The appellant asks that this court order the case to
    be retried by a judge sitting without a jury. This court has from time to time
    reversed a trial judge for striking a jury notice, directing a new trial before
    a judge and jury: see e.g. </span>Kempf, </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>at
    para. 78. While s. 134(1) of the </span>Courts of Justice Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> gives this court broad jurisdiction to make remedial
    orders, I have found no cases in which this court has directed that a new trial
    proceed without a jury. </span></em>In my view the prudent response to the
    appellant’s request is to refuse the order she seeks and to leave it to the
    trial judge to determine whether the jury should be discharged should a new
    trial proceed.</p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Threshold Decision</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>I have outlined above the skewed orientation in the
    evidence that went to the jury. This orientation also made its way into the
    trial judge’s threshold decision. In the threshold motion, the trial judge “incorporate[d]
    by reference the review of the evidence in [the] jury charge”: at para. 6. Although
    he did not otherwise refer to the opinion of Dr. Sanchez, it underpinned the
    trial judge’s basic approach. Because some of the best evidence that supported
    the statutory accident benefits settlement was excluded by the trial rulings,
    there was little to oppose the defence’s evidence.</span></em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> Dr. Sanchez’s opinion also provided the trial judge
    with a lens through which he looked askance at the other medical evidence Ms.
    Girao led. Because of the basic unfairness that permeated the trial, I would
    set aside the ruling on the threshold motion.</span></em></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>VI.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Disposition</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[175]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the
    appellant functioned as a legally-untrained, self-represented, non-English
    speaking litigant in testifying, examining and cross-examining through a Spanish
    interpreter. She was faced with a phalanx of defence counsel, two representing
    Ms. Cunningham, and two representing Allstate Insurance Company of Canada.  The
    trial was 20 days long, involved many witnesses, and considered complex medical
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[176]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Girao was entitled
    to but did not get the active assistance of the trial judge whose
    responsibility it was to ensure the fairness of the proceeding. As a
    self-represented litigant, she was also entitled to, but did not get, basic fairness
    from trial defence counsel as officers of the court.<a name="_Hlk36741395"> The
    trial judge was also entitled to seek and to be provided with the assistance of
    counsel as officers of the court, in the ways discussed above. This did not
    happen.</a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[177]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would
    allow the appellant’s appeal, set aside the judgment and orders, and order a
    new trial. I would award the costs of this appeal and of the trial to the
    appellant, including her disbursements. If the parties cannot agree on the
    quantum the appellant may file a written submission no more than five pages in
    length, in addition to receipts for disbursements, within 10 days of the date
    of this decision, and the respondent may respond within an additional 10 days.</p>
