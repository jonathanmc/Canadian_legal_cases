  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is Medallion Corporation, as
    authorized agent for the landlord, 280 Richmond Street West Limited (the
    “Landlord”). The respondent, RSM Canada Ltd. (the “Trustee”), is the trustee in
    bankruptcy of Curriculum Services Canada/Services des Programmes d’Études
    Canada (“Curriculum” or the “Tenant”). Curriculum was a tenant of the Landlord.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is the second appeal of the partial
    disallowance of the Landlord’s claim in the bankruptcy of the Tenant. The first
    appeal, from the decision of the Trustee, was to Chiappetta J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice (the “bankruptcy judge”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Broadly, this appeal is about the rights of a commercial
    landlord as a creditor in the bankruptcy of its tenant following the disclaimer
    of the lease by the trustee in bankruptcy. Specifically, the issue is whether a
    landlord has a claim arising from the disclaimer of its lease for any amount in
    relation to the unexpired term of the lease, other than its preferred claim for
    three months’ accelerated rent under s.&nbsp;136(1) of the <em>Bankruptcy and
    Insolvency Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “BIA”). In other words, can a
    landlord claim as an unsecured creditor for the disclaimer of its lease, calculated
    in accordance with its contractual rights under the lease?</span><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In Ontario, the law on this question was settled
    many years ago in <em>Re&nbsp;Mussens Ltd.</em>, [1933] O.W.N. 459 (H.C.).</span><a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> <span lang=EN-CA>As between the landlord and tenant, the disclaimer of a
    commercial lease by the tenant’s trustee in bankruptcy brings to an end the
    future or ongoing obligations of the tenant under the lease. The landlord has
    no right of compensation or claim as an unsecured creditor for damages in
    respect of the unexpired term of the lease in relation to the loss of the
    tenancy as a result of the disclaimer; the landlord is limited to its preferred
    claim for up to three months’ accelerated rent. The Landlord contends that this
    principle has been overtaken by more recent developments in the law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the Landlord claims the repayment
    of the value of certain tenant inducements ($203,442.37) according to a formula
    provided for in the lease. The Landlord asserts that it is entitled to claim this
    amount as an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy of its former tenant, upon
    and notwithstanding the Trustee’s disclaimer of the lease. The Landlord also claims
    the unpaid balance of its preferred claim for accelerated rent, pursuant to the
    lease, as an unsecured creditor under s.&nbsp;136(3) of the BIA, which amounts
    to $50,289.28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal, but only to permit the Landlord to rank as an unsecured creditor for
    the unpaid balance of its preferred claim. Subsection 136(3) of the BIA
    expressly authorizes a landlord to claim the unrecovered balance of its
    preferred claim as an unsecured creditor in the bankruptcy of its tenant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for the Landlord’s claim to rank as an
    unsecured creditor to recover unpaid tenant inducements, the obligations under
    the lease between the Tenant and Landlord came to an end once the Trustee
    disclaimed the lease. As I will explain, the long-accepted rule articulated in <em>Re
    Mussens </em>has not been attenuated by the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Highway
    Properties Ltd. v. Kelly, Douglas &amp; Co. Ltd.</em>, [1971] S.C.R. 562, nor
    has it been overruled by the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Crystalline Investments
    Ltd. v. Domgroup Ltd., </em>2004 SCC 3, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 60. The Landlord is not
    entitled to claim as an unsecured creditor in the bankrupt Tenant’s estate for
    damages relating to the unexpired term of the lease, except to recover the
    balance of its preferred claim for three months’ accelerated rent, which is specifically
    provided for by statute.</span></p>
  <h2>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord and Tenant were parties to a lease dated
    May 26, 2017 (the “Lease”). The Lease was for 8,322 square feet of space at 150
    John Street West, Toronto, for a term of ten years and six months, commencing
    on July&nbsp;1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2027.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 29, 2018, and without being in default
    of its obligations under the Lease, Curriculum made an assignment in
    bankruptcy. RSM Canada Inc. was appointed trustee. The Trustee occupied the
    leased premises and paid occupation rent of $25,698.31 to the Landlord.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 20, 2018, the Landlord filed a Proof of
    Claim in the bankruptcy. The Landlord claimed $100,558.59 as a preferred claim
    for three months’ accelerated rent, in accordance with the priority of claims
    prescribed by s. 136(1)(f) of the BIA. Because the realization of property on
    the leased premises yielded an amount that was less than the preferred claim
    ($24,571), the Landlord asserted its right to claim the balance of the
    unrecovered preferred claim ($75,987.59) as an unsecured creditor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord also advanced an unsecured claim in
    the amount of $4,028,111.23. This represented its claim for rent payable for
    the balance of the unexpired portion of the term of the Lease, together with
    amounts for tenant inducements consisting of leasehold improvements provided at
    the Landlord’s cost under the Lease and free rent for a six-month period. In
    asserting its rights, the Landlord relied on the Tenant’s obligation under the
    Lease to make certain payments on bankruptcy, including on termination or
    disclaimer of the Lease.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 16.1 of the Lease provides for events of
    default, including the bankruptcy of the Tenant. It also provides for the
    Landlord’s remedies, including: the payment of three months’ accelerated rent;
    the right to terminate the Lease (with the right to obtain damages for the
    Landlord’s deficiency for the balance of the term); and upon any termination,
    including disclaimer, payment of the value of the unpaid amount of any tenant
    inducements calculated over the unexpired term of the Lease. The relevant
    portions of s. 16.1 read as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>16.1. If any of the following shall occur:</p>

    assignment, arrangement or compromise with its creditors or Tenant sells all or
    substantially all of its personal property at the Premises other than in the
    ordinary course of business (and other than in connection with a Transfer requiring
    Landlord’s consent and approved in writing by Landlord), or steps are taken or
    action or proceedings commenced by any person for the dissolution, winding up
    or other termination of Tenant’s existence or liquidation of its assets

    to the value of any leasehold improvement allowance, tenant inducement payment,
    rent free periods, lease takeover, Leasehold Improvements or any other work for
    Tenant’s benefit completed at Landlord’s cost or any moving allowance, which
    value shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
    number of months from the date of Termination to the date which would have been
    the natural expiry of this Lease but for such Termination, and the denominator

  <h2>IV.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE REASONS OF THE BANKRUPTCY JUDGE</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The bankruptcy judge identified the issue as “whether
    it remains the law in Ontario that the disclaimer of a lease by a trustee in
    bankruptcy prevents a landlord from claiming unsecured damages”. She dismissed
    the Landlord’s appeal of the partial disallowance of its claim on the basis of a
    “long-established legal precedent”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The bankruptcy judge referred to and followed
    the analysis of the Registrar in Bankruptcy in <em>Re Linens ‘N Things Canada
    Corp.</em> (2009), 53 C.B.R. (5th) 232 (Ont. S.C.). In that case, the Registrar
    upheld a trustee’s disallowance of amounts claimed under a lease, including the
    costs of building a structure expressly for the tenant, the tenant allowance,
    and the leasing commission. The Registrar relied on <em>Re Mussens </em>as
    authority that, after a disclaimer, there is no right in Ontario for a landlord
    to claim damages in respect of the unexpired portion of the lease. The
    bankruptcy judge noted that the Registrar in <em>Re Linens ‘N Things </em>rejected
    the argument, based on <em>Highway Properties</em>, that the landlord could recover
    contractual damages as <em>Highway Properties</em> did not involve an
    insolvency. She endorsed para. 21 of <em>Re Linens ‘N Things </em>where the
    Registrar stated that “the CTA and its predecessors has been found … to have
    the effect of a consensual ending of the lease, and … this is a statutorily
    permitted breach for which there is no damage remedy, beyond the s. 38 CTA and
    s. 136 BIA preferred claim”.</span></p>

    effectively overruled <em>Re Mussens</em>.<em> </em>After a close examination
    of each of these cases, as well as <em>Cummer-Yonge Investments Ltd. v. Fagot
    et al. </em>(1965), 50 D.L.R. (2d) 25 (Ont. H.C.), aff’d without reasons (1965),
    50 D.L.R. (2d) 30n (Ont. C.A.) (a case that was overruled in<em> obiter </em>in <em>Crystalline Investments</em>),<em> </em>the bankruptcy judge concluded that <em>Crystalline Investments </em>had not addressed whether a landlord can claim
    unsecured damages in the bankruptcy proceedings of its tenant upon the disclaimer
    of a lease by the trustee, and that the principle in <em>Re Mussens </em>remained
    the law on this issue in Ontario, as correctly applied in <em>Re Linens ‘N

lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The bulk of these reasons will address the first
    question, which involves the Landlord’s challenge to the ongoing authority of <em>Re
    Mussens </em>and the Landlord’s interpretation of the relevant provisions of
    the BIA and CTA<em>. </em>With respect to the second issue, I will briefly
    explain that, on a plain reading of s. 38 of the CTA, together with s. 136(3)
    of the BIA, the Landlord is entitled to claim as an unsecured creditor for the
    balance of its preferred claim for three months’ accelerated rent.</span></p>
  <h2>VI.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h3>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the landlord entitled to assert a claim for unpaid tenant inducements
    under the lease as an unsecured creditor in Curriculum’s bankruptcy?</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord contends that it should be able to
    claim in Curriculum’s bankruptcy for unpaid tenant inducements under the Lease
    in the same way that other unsecured creditors can assert claims for
    contractual damages. It argues that the principle in <em>Re Mussens</em> was overruled
    by the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Crystalline Investments</em>. Further, the
    Landlord suggests that, while other provinces have specifically prohibited
    landlords from claiming damages for the unexpired portion of a lease, the CTA
    contains no such restriction and does not prohibit such a claim. In effect, the
    Landlord proposes an interpretation of ss.&nbsp;38 and 39 of the CTA that, upon
    disclaimer, would give priority to its claim for up to three months’
    accelerated rent, while permitting it to claim damages in respect of the
    unexpired term of the Lease in accordance with the terms of the Lease.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord relies on the principle stated in <em>Highway
    Properties</em>, that a lease both creates an interest in land and gives rise
    to contractual rights, and its recognition of a landlord’s right to accept a tenant’s
    termination of a lease and to sue for damages for its breach. The Landlord argues
    that there is nothing in the BIA or the CTA to prevent a landlord from filing
    an unsecured claim for damages in the estate of a bankrupt tenant, nor is there
    any principled reason why a landlord should be treated differently from other
    creditors in a bankruptcy. The Landlord points to the terms of the Lease that
    expressly contemplate and provide for the situation of a bankruptcy or
    disclaimer and set out the contractual damages to which the Landlord is
    entitled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the discussion that follows, I begin with a
    brief summary of<em> Re Mussens </em>and the way that this authority has been
    interpreted by the courts. I will specifically address a line of cases dealing
    with the obligations of guarantors, assignors, and others following the disclaimer
    of a commercial lease, including the leading case from Ontario, <em>Cummer-Yonge
    Investments.</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Turning to <em>Crystalline Investments</em>,<em> </em>I will explain that, while overturning the principle in <em>Cummer-Yonge Investments</em> that a trustee’s disclaimer can release a guarantor from its obligations under
    the lease, <em>Crystalline Investments</em> did not address, and left intact,
    the rule articulated in <em>Re Mussens</em> and later cases, that on disclaimer
    of a commercial lease by its trustee, an Ontario landlord has no claim against
    a bankrupt tenant arising out of the disclaimer for damages in respect of the
    unexpired term of the lease; the landlord has only what is specifically
    provided for – its preferred claim for three months’ accelerated rent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I will then turn to the Landlord’s argument
    based on <em>Highway Properties. </em>As I will explain, the argument that <em>Highway
    Properties </em>alters the principle stated in <em>Re Mussens</em>, and affords
    additional remedies to a landlord post-disclaimer, has been rejected in other
    cases, and for good reason. <em>Highway Properties </em>recognized that a lease
    is also a contract, and provided for a landlord’s “fourth option” after a
    tenant’s repudiation, that of accepting the repudiation, and suing for prospective
    damages. The case, however, did not address a situation of bankruptcy or insolvency.
    The remedies for a tenant’s repudiation do not apply once a trustee has
    disclaimed the lease. The Landlord’s argument fails to recognize the
    fundamental distinction between a disclaimer and a repudiation of a lease.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, on this issue, I will briefly consider
    the Landlord’s argument that the relevant statutory provisions should be
    interpreted harmoniously with those that apply to a reorganization under the <em>Companies’
    Creditors Arrangements Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (the “CCAA”). While the
    CCAA contains provisions that permit the disclaimer of any agreement to which
    the company is a party, including leases, and specifically provides for a
    provable claim by a party suffering a loss in relation to the disclaimer, there
    is no comparable provision that applies to leases disclaimed by a trustee on
    bankruptcy.</span></p>
  <h6 style='line-height:normal'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principle stated in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Re Mussens</span></em></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Re Mussens</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> involved
    a landlord’s claim for damages under the <em>Winding&#8209;Up Act</em>, R.S.C.
    1927, c. 213, for breach of its tenant’s covenant to pay future rent after the
    liquidator had disclaimed the lease. Rose C.J. rejected the landlord’s claim,
    concluding, at pp. 460-61, that if the liquidator exercised its right under the<em> Landlord and Tenant Act</em>, R.S.O. 1927, c. 190 to “surrender possession or
    disclaim” the lease, then there could be no further liability of the tenant to
    pay rent “and no suggestion that, by failing to pay rent, the tenant was
    committing a breach of covenant and was rendering himself liable for liquidated
    or unliquidated damages”. Rose C.J. stated, at pp. 460-61:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>I think that by his letter of April 21, 1932, confirmed in his
    letter of June 21, 1932, the liquidator exercised his right “to surrender
    possession or disclaim” the lease, and that when he had exercised that right
    the obligation of the tenant, the insolvent company, to pay rent was at an end.
    It did not require a statute to confer upon the liquidator power to surrender
    possession or disclaim the lease with the consent of the lessor; <u>the statute
    means I think that whether the lessor is or is not willing the liquidator may
    surrender possession or disclaim the lease, and that if he does so surrender
    possession or disclaim the lease the tenant in liquidation shall be in the same
    position as if the lease had been surrendered with the consent of the lessor.</u> Of course, if the lease were surrendered with the consent of the lessor, there
    could be no suggestion of any further liability on the part of the lessee to
    pay rent and no suggestion that, by failing to pay rent, the tenant was
    committing a breach of covenant and was rendering himself liable for liquidated
    or unliquidated damages. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this passage, Rose C.J. concluded that the
    statutory right to “surrender possession or disclaim” a lease has the same
    effect as a surrender with the consent of the lessor. As I will explain, this statement,
    equating a disclaimer with a consensual surrender of a lease, was applied in
    subsequent cases, such as <em>Cummer-Yonge Investments</em>, to release
    derivative obligations such as those of a guarantor, after a lease had been
    disclaimed by a tenant’s trustee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>More important to the present analysis, however,
    is the court’s interpretation in <em>Re Mussens </em>of the relevant statutory
    provisions, and whether they permit a landlord to make a claim for damages for
    the surrender or disclaimer of the lease in the tenant’s bankruptcy
    proceedings. Contrasting the provisions of the<em> Landlord and Tenant Act</em> with the comparable legislation in England that provided specifically for a
    right to compensation following a disclaimer, at p. 461, Rose C.J. concluded
    that, in Ontario, there was no “similar saving of the rights of the lessor” and
    therefore no equivalent right to compensation. In other words, the silence in
    the Ontario legislation on the question of compensation meant that, after a disclaimer,
    the landlord had no claim for damages against the tenant in relation to the
    ending of the lease, and was limited to what it was specifically afforded by
    statute. Rose C.J. stated, at p. 461:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In England, as is pointed out by the Master in his judgment,
    the statute with which sec. 38 of <em><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord and Tenant
    Act</span></em> more or less corresponds, contains the provision that any
    person injured by the operation of the section (i.e., by the disclaimer or
    surrender) shall be deemed a creditor of the bankrupt to the extent of such
    injury and may accordingly prove the same as a debt under the bankruptcy; but
    the Ontario statute contains no similar saving of the rights of the lessor, and <u>I think that the result is that in Ontario the liquidator has been given a
    statutory right to commit a breach of the insolvent's covenant, and that no
    right of compensation for the statutory breach having been given to the
    covenantee no damages can be recovered</u><em><span lang=EN-CA>.</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> </span>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Re Mussens</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> accordingly stands for the principle that, under Ontario law, the trustee of a
    bankrupt tenant is permitted by statute to bring an end to the lease, and all future
    obligations of the tenant thereunder, by surrendering possession of the leased
    premises or disclaiming the lease within three months of the bankruptcy. The
    principle articulated in <em>Re Mussens</em>, and the case itself, have been
    referred to in subsequent cases (some of which are referred to later in these
    reasons) and in articles and texts dealing with bankruptcy and insolvency and
    commercial leases. See e.g. L.W. Houlden, “Bankruptcy of the Landlord or Tenant”
    (1965), 7 C.B.R. (N.S.) 113, at p. 123; Christopher Bentley et al.<em>, Williams
    &amp; Rhodes’ Canadian Law of Landlord and Tenant,</em> 6th ed. (Toronto:
    Thomson Reuters Canada Limited, 2019), at c. 12:6:3 (WL); Steven Jeffery, “<em>Cummer-Yonge</em> - A Post-Mortem: <em>Crystalline Investments Ltd. v. Domgroup Ltd</em>.” (2006),
    21 B.F.L.R. 263, at p. 285; and David Bish, <em>Canadian Bankruptcy and
    Insolvency Law for Commercial Tenancies</em>, (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada Inc.,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord notes that four provinces have
    legislation that expressly prohibits the type of claim it advances here (Prince
    Edward Island, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia), while nine
    provinces and territories have no such prohibition. However, it does not
    follow, as the Landlord argues, that such a claim is permitted where it is not
    expressly prohibited or restricted. Indeed, the Landlord has not cited a single
    case that would interpret the legislation this way, nor any case that is
    contrary to the interpretation provided for in <em>Re Mussens</em>. As discussed, <em>Re Mussens</em> interpreted the absence of a landlord’s statutory right of
    compensation for termination of the lease after a disclaimer (other than the

    tenant. In particular, courts have relied on the statement in<em> Re&nbsp;Mussens </em>equating a disclaimer with a mutual surrender of a lease to conclude that
    the obligations of assignors and guarantors also come to an end with the
    disclaimer of a lease.</span></p>

    to a third-party guarantee securing “the due performance by the lessee of all
    of its covenants … including the covenant to pay rent”. The landlord accepted
    that the tenant’s further obligations under the lease had ended, but asserted
    that, upon disclaimer, the rights and obligations under the lease were revested
    in the bankrupt tenant, and so would permit a claim on a guarantee.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Gale C.J. rejected this argument, citing the
    passage from<em> Re Mussens </em>equating a disclaimer to a surrender. He
    concluded that on bankruptcy, all of the tenants’ rights and obligations under
    the lease irrevocably pass to the trustee and “when the trustee subsequently
    disclaimed that interest, all the rights and obligations which he inherited
    from the bankrupt were wholly at an end”: at p. 29. For this reason, the
    guarantee was inoperative. Thereafter there could be no covenants in the lease
    which the lessee was required to perform, so that the guarantee of the “due
    performance by the lessee of all its covenants in the lease&quot; was thereupon
    extinguished.</span></p>

    that cited and relied on the statement in <em>Re Mussens </em>equating the
    statutory surrender of possession or disclaimer by a trustee to a surrender

    (2d) 5 (Man. C.A.), at p. 14, Wilson J. cited <em>Re&nbsp;Mussens </em>as
    authority that, upon the disclaimer of a lease by the trustee, all liability of
    the trustee and of the estate of the bankrupt lessee up to that time was
    extinguished, and that the landlord could not rank against the estate of the
    bankrupt for breach of contract. Citing <em>Cummer-Yonge Investments</em>, Wilson

    Enterprises Ltd.</em> (1993), 100 D.L.R. (4th) 359 (B.C.C.A.). In that case, the
    assignor tenants made the argument accepted in <em>Cummer-Yonge Investments </em>–
    that a disclaimer had the same effect as a mutual surrender of a lease, with
    the result that the obligations of any third party, such as an assignor, would
    be eliminated. The relevant B.C. legislation was comparable to ss. 38 and 39 of

    C.J. in<em> Re Mussens</em>), that the U.K. statute specifically gave to any

    bankruptcy for such injury. He then referred to later English case law
    restricting the meaning of surrender in this statutory context, including <em>Hill
    v. East &amp; West India Dock Co.</em> (1884), 9 App. Cas. 448 (H.L.), where

    the disclaimer of a lease by a trustee to a surrender. He approved of the way the <a name="crsw_paragraph_num_25_1"></a>English courts had approached the U.K.
    legislation: the effect of a disclaimer should be limited to accomplishing the
    purpose of the bankruptcy scheme only, and, so far as possible, to not
    adversely affect the position of those outside the bankruptcy. As a result, he
    held, at p. 369, that the trustee’s disclaimer did not end the leases for <u>all</u> purposes and that the assignor tenants remained liable for the bankrupt
    assignee’s failure to pay rent.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Domgroup argued successfully at first instance that its position was
    comparable to that of the guarantor in <em>Cummer-Yonge Investments</em>: the
    effect of the repudiation of the leases in the bankruptcy proposal was that all

    its obligations as assignor. Domgroup was successful in having the action
    dismissed in its summary judgment motion: (2001), 39 R.P.R. (3d) 49 (Ont. S.C.).
    The landlords prevailed in their appeal to this court: (2002), 49 R.P.R. (3d)
    171 (Ont. C.A.). Carthy J.A., writing for this court, referred to and approved
    of the reasoning of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <em>Transco Mills. </em>He
    also purported to distinguish <em>Cummer-Yonge Investments</em>, on the basis
    of the difference between a guarantor of obligations under a lease and one who
    has primary obligations. In this case, the assignor had signed “as principal
    and not as surety”.</span></p>

    arrangement resulting from the assignment of a lease: “In both situations the
    repudiation must be construed as benefiting only the insolvent”: at para. 27. At
    para. 28, he observed that “[t]he plain purposes of the section are to free an
    insolvent from the obligations under a commercial lease that have become too
    onerous, to compensate the landlord for the early determination of the lease,
    and to allow the insolvent to resume viable operations as best it can”, and
    that “[n]othing in s. 65.2, or any part of the Act, protects third parties (i.e.
    guarantors, assignors or others) from the consequences of an insolvent’s repudiation
    of a commercial lease”. Major J. confirmed that such third parties would remain
    liable when the party on whose behalf they acted becomes insolvent. He
    explained that, on an assignment of a lease, while the landlord’s privity of
    estate with the original tenant comes to an end, the privity of contract
    continues and the original tenant remains liable upon its covenant: at para. 29.<a

    lease in excess of the preferred payment required to be paid to the landlord
    under s. 65.2. Major J. rejected this argument, noting that in such

    the obligations of the tenant under the lease. Indeed, he assumed that the

    an end, and he explained that the purpose of s. 65.2 of the BIA is “to free an
    insolvent from the obligations under a commercial lease that have become too
    onerous, to compensate the landlord for the early determination of the lease,
    and to allow the insolvent to resume viable operations as best it can”: at
    para. 28. <em>Crystalline Investments</em> is consistent with the principle
    stated in <em>Re Mussens</em> that a disclaimer operates to end the <u>bankrupt

    on <em>Re Mussens </em>and distinguished <em>Crystalline Investments </em>in

    on disclaimer, “the bankrupt no longer has any obligations owing to the
    landlord under the lease, and the landlord is not entitled to draw on a letter
    of credit provided as security under the lease for any amounts in excess of the
    Landlord’s three months’ accelerated rent preferred claim under s. 136(1)(f) of

    was not impacted by <em>Crystalline Investments </em>because the obligation to
    make payment under the letter of credit was “wholly dependent on the continued

    its loss calculated over the unexpired term of the lease. The lower courts had dismissed
    the landlord’s claim for prospective damages, concluding that the repudiation
    of the lease by the tenant and the taking of possession by the landlord
    amounted to a surrender by operation of law, so that the lease ceased to exist.

    tenant’s covenants under the lease came to an end. Laskin J. accepted the
    proposition that the landlord had a fourth <em><u><span style='font-style:normal'>contractual</span></u></em> option on repudiation of the lease, which was exercised in that case: to terminate
    the lease with notice to the tenant that damages will be claimed for the loss

    152 (Ont. Gen. Div.), the issue was whether, post-disclaimer, a landlord could
    claim as an unsecured creditor in its tenant’s bankruptcy for damages in lieu
    of payments that would have been due under the unexpired portion of a five-year
    commercial lease. These included rent before the premises were re-let, taxes, maintenance
    costs, and the shortfall on re&#8209;letting the premises. Maloney J. observed
    that it would be a “grave error” to adopt the analysis and decision in <em>Highway
    Properties </em>as “the present case involves a bankruptcy, which is quite
    different from an outright repudiation of a contract. A bankruptcy is a final
    and irreversible situation”: at p. 158. He rejected the argument that the reference
    to the landlord’s rights being determined by the “laws of the province in which
    the leased premises are situated” in s. 146 of the BIA, referred to the common
    law of the province, including the option to accept the termination and to sue
    for prospective damages, as recognized in <em>Highway Properties. </em>Rather,
    this phrase referred to ss. 38 and 39 of the <em>Landlord and Tenant Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, which together with the BIA would limit the landlord’s
    claim to three months’ rent. Maloney J. concluded that the BIA and the <em>Landlord
    and Tenant Act</em> provided a comprehensive scheme for the administration of
    the leasehold interests of bankrupt tenants and that <em>Highway Properties </em>had
    no application: at pp. 158-59.</span></p>

    structure, amounts provided under the lease as a tenant's allowance, and the
    commission paid on the lease itself by the landlord, following the disclaimer
    of the lease by the trustee. The landlord, relying on <em>Highway Properties</em>,
    had characterized these claims as damages for breach of contract rather than
    rent. The Registrar rejected this argument, noting that in <em>Highway
    Properties </em>the tenant had repudiated the lease, and there was no
    insolvency or any question of the applicability of s. 146 of the BIA or
    anything like ss. 38 and 39 of the CTA. As such, the terms of the lease, which
    reserved to the appellant “all of its rights at law and equity for breach of

    Principal Group Ltd. (Trustee of) </em>(1996), 9 W.W.R. 539 (Alta. Q.B.). In
    that case, the trustee of a bankrupt tenant disallowed the landlord’s claim for
    damages for the unexpired portion of the leases, taking the position that on
    disclaimer, the entire balance of the unsecured claim was extinguished. The
    landlord argued that <em>Re Mussens</em> and <em>Re Vrablik</em> were wrongly
    decided because they concluded that a disclaimer has the same effect as a
    surrender, when in fact a disclaimer is a form of repudiation by the trustee without
    the landlord’s consent. The landlord argued that on disclaimer, the landlord
    has the same rights that it would have on repudiation in a non-bankruptcy situation
    under <em>Highway Properties</em>. Cairns J. rejected this argument, stating
    that the overwhelming weight of authority was that the combined effect of the
    federal and provincial legislation is that “the claim of the landlord
    respecting the unexpired portion of the leases has been extinguished by the
    disclaimer of the leases”: at p.&nbsp;596.</span></p>

    Restructuring Officer (the “CRO”) had already repudiated the lease on behalf of
    the tenant before the restructuring efforts failed and the tenant declared

    the tenant the right to “vacate, abandon or quit any leased premises and/or
    terminate or repudiate any lease … without prior notice … in writing … on such
    terms as may be agreed upon between the Applicant and such landlord or, failing
    such agreement, to deal with the consequences thereof in the Plan”. The CRO
    exercised that right, sending a repudiation letter to the landlord. The
    landlord never acknowledged, accepted, signed or returned the repudiation
    letter before the restructuring failed and the bankruptcy occurred. The
    landlord submitted a Proof of Claim that included its “unrecoverable expenses”
    during the entire term of the lease. The trustee issued a disclaimer of the
    lease the following month. The landlord argued that the repudiation was
    complete when the trustee received the repudiation letter, and that the lease
    had already been forfeited when the trustee issued its disclaimer. This
    argument was rejected at first instance, and the appeal from the disallowance
    was dismissed.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the landlord’s further appeal to this court, Gillese
    J.A. noted that the effect of the trustee’s disclaimer of the lease was to
    bring the lease to an end and to terminate all rights and obligations for the
    payment of rent: “Thus, if the trustee disclaims the lease, the landlord has no
    claim for rent for the remainder of the lease”: at para. 14. She went on to
    discuss the effect of the repudiation letter. Citing <em>Highway Properties</em>,
    Gillese J.A. explained that repudiation does not in and of itself bring a lease
    to an end. Rather, “[i]t confers on the innocent party a right of election to,
    among other things, treat the lease as at an end, thereby relieving the parties
    of further performance, though not relieving the repudiating party from its
    liabilities for breach”: at para. 34. In the absence of any election, the
    landlord/tenant relationship remained intact, and the lease, which had not been
    brought to an end in the CCAA<em> </em>proceedings, was therefore susceptible
    to statutory disclaimer by the trustee following the commencement of
    bankruptcy: at paras. 38, 40.</span></p>

    options under <em>Highway Properties </em>would have been available to it,
    including an unsecured claim for its losses over the unexpired term of the

  <p class=CQuote>It may be argued that disclaimer ought to be viewed as a type
    of <span lang=EN-CA>repudiation</span>, or equivalent to a repudiation. In some
    respects, they achieve similar outcomes and share similar characteristics,
    including a fundamental refusal by a tenant to perform a lease. However, the
    better view is that there is an important distinction between the two concepts
    and neither the acts nor the consequences that flow from the acts are
    synonymous. Disclaimer is appealing because of its simplicity in insolvent
    circumstances and in sidestepping unnecessary legal complications that arise in
    cases of repudiation. In this respect, disclaimer is more akin to a unilateral
    and irrevocable act of the tenant (one that dispenses with complications such
    as the doctrines of waiver, notice, elections and the like), with established
    consequences for tenant and landlord alike. A disclaimer, unlike a repudiation,
    does not “put the ball in the landlord’s court”, so to speak; it avoids the
    dance between landlord and tenant that ensues where a repudiation occurs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the panoply of <em>Highway Properties</em> options should be available on
    disclaimer makes little sense in the insolvency scenario where it is clear that
    certain of those options are unworkable and where the statute provides a
    specific right to compensation. The landlord should not be able to elect a remedy
    that would negate or undermine the statutory right to disclaim: at pp. 234-35.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord asserts that Curriculum’s
    bankruptcy and the disclaimer were each events of default under s. 16.1 of the Lease,
    triggering the rights and remedies provided thereunder. The Landlord’s rights
    and remedies in this case, however, are determined by statute and not by the
    terms of the Lease. The remedies provided under the Lease for default – even
    those specifically applicable in bankruptcy or upon disclaimer – simply were
    not available once the Lease was disclaimed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On bankruptcy, the Lease vested in the Trustee
    and was subject to the various rights and remedies prescribed by the
    legislation. As in <em>Re TNG Acquisition </em>there was no termination of the
    Lease that preceded the bankruptcy, and the Landlord’s claim for damages for
    the loss of the Lease is precluded.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was suggested that the Landlord’s claim for
    tenant inducements might be considered an existing or accrued claim because the
    Landlord seeks to recover money it has already spent (in the nature of a loan
    to the Tenant) and not damages for the loss of the Lease. There is no merit to
    this argument. The Landlord’s claim is not for the value of the tenant inducements
    accrued up to the time of bankruptcy. The Landlord has already recovered such
    amounts in the rental payments it received. The claim is for the value of
    tenant inducements calculated for the remaining term of the Lease. The
    entitlement to recoup an amount for tenant inducements arises under the Lease
    and only “if [the] Lease is terminated due to the default of Tenant, or if it
    is disclaimed, repudiated or terminated in any insolvency proceedings”. It is a
    remedy for default, including bankruptcy or disclaimer. In other words, the
    Landlord had no right to recover such amounts prior to the bankruptcy, when the
    Lease was immediately vested in the Trustee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To reiterate, the Trustee’s disclaimer brought
    to an end the rights and remedies of the Landlord against Curriculum with
    respect to the unexpired term of the Lease, apart from the three months’
    accelerated rent specifically provided for under the CTA and BIA. The
    Landlord’s unsecured claim, however it is characterized, is precluded because
    the disclaimer brings to an end both the Tenant’s ability to insist on
    performance of the Lease by the Landlord and the Landlord’s ability to claim in
    the Tenant’s bankruptcy in respect of any of its remedies. The Lease ended by
    disclaimer without the Landlord having terminated it or invoked its remedies
    under the Lease upon the occurrence of events under s.&nbsp;16.1.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The statutory claim is provided in place or in
    lieu of any ongoing rights a landlord might have against the tenant under its
    lease. In Ontario, the landlord has a right to claim for three months’
    accelerated rent. While the right can only be exercised if the lease provides
    for it, the right is one prescribed by statute and does not assume the
    continued existence or enforceability of the lease.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Landlord’s final argument on this issue is
    that the disclaimer provisions should be interpreted to permit it to assert a
    claim for damages for the unpaid tenant inducements because claims for damages
    are permitted under the parallel BIA proposal provisions and the CCAA disclaimer
    provision. The Landlord relies on the Supreme Court decision in <em>Century
    Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2010 SCC 60, [2010] 3 S.C.R.
    379 for its “harmonization argument”. The Landlord quotes para. 24 of that
    decision, which states the following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>With parallel <em>CCAA</em> and <em>BIA</em> restructuring schemes now an accepted feature of the insolvency law landscape,

    Landlord in the present appeal. In that case, the issue was whether GST
    collected by a debtor but not yet remitted was subject to a statutory deemed
    trust under the <em>Excise Tax Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c.&nbsp;E-15 (the “ETA”)
    in favour of the Crown, and whether the deemed trust would prevail when a CCAA
    stay was lifted to permit the debtor to enter bankruptcy. The debtor had
    attempted reorganization under the CCAA, and the subject funds were held in the
    monitor’s trust account until it could be determined whether the reorganization
    would be successful. The ETA provided that the deemed trust operated despite
    any other enactment of Canada, except the BIA. Under the BIA, the Crown
    priority was lost. As a preliminary issue, the court confronted the apparent
    inconsistency between two federal statutes: the ETA which only expressly
    recognized the BIA loss of priority and the CCAA, which was enacted before the
    ETA and provided that “notwithstanding any provision in federal or provincial
    legislation that has the effect of deeming property to be held in trust for Her
    Majesty, property of a debtor company shall not be [so] regarded”: s. 18.3(1).</span></p>

    the statutory interpretation issue by concluding that the Crown’s deemed trust
    was lost under the CCAA in the same way that it was lost under the BIA. She
    refused to accept that the ETA trumped the provision of the CCAA purporting to
    nullify most deemed statutory trusts. At para. 47, she noted that “a strange
    asymmetry would arise if the interpretation giving the <em>ETA </em>priority
    over the <em>CCAA </em>urged by the Crown is adopted here: the Crown would
    retain priority over GST claims during <em>CCAA </em>proceedings but not in
    bankruptcy”. Although the effect was to “harmonize” the two regimes in their
    treatment of the Crown deemed trust, in fact, this was simply a question of
    statutory interpretation. Deschamps J. gave effect to the provisions of the
    CCAA and the BIA which treated Crown GST claims the same way.</span></p>

    “harmonization” to describe something else: the ability of the CCAA judge to
    partially lift the CCAA stay to allow the debtor’s entry into bankruptcy,
    without requiring the term sought by the Crown – the payment of the claimed
    deemed trust for GST. She recognized that the CCAA judge’s order fostered a
    “harmonious transition between reorganization and liquidation” and that the court
    had discretion under the CCAA to “construct a bridge to liquidation under the

    whether the insolvent person would be able to make a viable proposal without
    the disclaimer or resiliation. Section 65.2 provides that the landlord has no
    claim for accelerated rent even if the lease provides for it. The landlord has
    an election as to the calculation of its claim: it may claim its actual losses
    or an amount prescribed by a formula. No provision is made for priority of the
    landlord’s claim. The disclaimer provisions also contemplate what happens where
    the proposal fails and the tenant becomes bankrupt, and also the reverse –
    where a tenant is bankrupt and then makes a proposal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unlike the BIA proposal provisions that deal
    specifically with commercial leases, the CCAA disclaimer provision, s. 32, applies
    to the disclaimer of all agreements, including leases. Again, the disclaimer is
    subject to objection of the other party and court order. Subsection 32(7)
    provides that, where an agreement is disclaimed or resiliated, a party who
    suffers a loss in relation to the disclaimer is considered to have a provable
    claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fact that the BIA proposal provisions and
    the CCAA disclaimer provision specifically provide for a landlord’s claims for
    damages following “disclaimer” simply indicates that Parliament intentionally
    departed from the bankruptcy model for landlord claims in the context of a restructuring.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In sum, the fact that the three insolvency
    regimes all permit disclaimer but provide for different remedies represents a
    policy choice by Parliament. In such circumstances, there is no scope for
    applying the “harmonization” principle, or reading the different provisions as
    providing for the same remedy. Such an interpretation would render the
    legislator’s deliberate policy choice irrelevant.</span></p>

    ranking priorities and, under s. 136(1)(f), was limited to the realization from
    the property on the leased premises. As noted above, the Trustee realized only $24,571
    from the sale of the property on the premises leased by Curriculum. In
    consequence, the Trustee allowed the Landlord’s preferred claim for $24,571,
    but disallowed the balance.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The Landlord is entitled to rank as an unsecured creditor for the unpaid

    BIA. See also <em>Re Gingras Automobile Lté</em><em>e.</em>, [1962] S.C.R. 676,
    at p. 680, where Abbott J., writing for the court, held that the combined
    effect of the relevant provisions under the<em> Bankruptcy Act</em>, R.S.C.
    1952, c. 14 is that a landlord is only entitled to rank as an unsecured
    creditor for any balance to which it may be entitled under provincial law. Under
    s. 38 of the CTA, a landlord is entitled to a preferred claim for three months’
    accelerated rent.</span></p>
