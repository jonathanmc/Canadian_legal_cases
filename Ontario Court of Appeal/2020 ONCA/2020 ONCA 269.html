  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of various drug-related offences following the
    execution of search warrants. He argues that the trial judge erred in finding
    that the Information to Obtain (“ITO”) was sufficient to support the issue of
    the warrants and submits that the evidence ought to have been excluded pursuant
    to s. 24(2) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em>. He also appeals
    his sentence.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Police received information that a suspicious
    young male was frequenting a Walton Drive address in Aurora. They discovered
    the appellant lived there and that he was on bail for weapons and drug
    trafficking offences. Police began surveillance of the appellant. Over the
    following months, they observed him going to a storage locker rented in someone
    else’s name and engaging in what appeared to be a drug transaction. On one
    occasion, police took swabs of the exterior door handle of the appellant’s car.
    The swabs were subjected to ion scan testing. They tested positive for cocaine. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Information to Obtain the Search Warrants
    of February 8, 2017 </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on this surveillance, on February 8, 2017,
    DC McGregor swore an ITO to obtain search warrants. The ITO contained the
    following information: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In November 2016, the appellant was on bail for two
    sets of offences in Toronto, including weapons trafficking and possession for
    the purpose of trafficking. One set of offences was committed while on bail for
    the other. The conditions of release required the appellant to reside at the
    Walton residence and remain inside from midnight until 6:00 a.m. unless
    accompanied by his father or surety. On November 9, 2016, the appellant’s
    father said he had not seen his son in two days, but that he believed his son
    had been granted a bail variance allowing him four-day periods away from home. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A Toronto judge concluded that the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights had been violated in the course of a search relating to the Toronto
    charges, but that the evidence would be admitted nonetheless. There was an
    agreed statement of facts and it was anticipated that the appellant would be
    convicted of both sets of Toronto charges on his next court date. A copy of the
    Toronto judge’s <i>Charter</i> reasons was attached as an exhibit to the ITO.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police observed the appellant going into a
    storage unit in Mississauga on five occasions in November 2016, December 2016,
    and January 2017. The appellant drove a Lexus to the unit and attended other
    addresses afterward. On February 3, 2017, the police installed hidden cameras
    at the storage facility. The footage showed the appellant frequently attended
    the storage unit over the course of several days, often arriving and leaving empty-handed.
    No one else was filmed attending the storage unit. The appellant was seen
    paying for the unit, but it was rented in the name of another individual whom
    police confirmed had not, in fact, rented it. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 27, 2017, the appellant attended a
    Walmart in Toronto. An officer overheard a conversation between the appellant
    and another male in which they said “cheap”, “crack”, “stepped-on”, and
    “passcode”. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 28, 2017, when the appellant went
    inside a restaurant, officers took a swab from the exterior driver’s side door
    handle. The door handle was cleaned, and a second swab taken as a control
    sample. The appellant left the restaurant and conducted what police believed to
    be a drug transaction in an IKEA parking lot, with an unknown man getting in
    the Lexus briefly with a bag, which appeared emptier when he left the car.
    After, the appellant attended the storage unit. Later, the appellant entered a
    Toronto address, and officers obtained a third swab from the door handle. All
    three swabs tested positive for cocaine. In the ITO, the affiant said the
    control sample may have tested positive because the door handle was not
    adequately cleaned, or due to the texture/nature of cocaine or the door handle,
    or because there was so much cocaine saturation that residue remained. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>DC McGregor said he did not rely on any
    information gathered through a tracking device he placed on the appellant’s
    Lexus in December 2016. Although he was granted a warrant, upon review DC McGregor
    concluded the original affidavit included bias that outweighed the facts
    presented.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the bail conditions cited in the ITO
    had been varied and were no longer accurate in one regard: the appellant was
    allowed to be out between midnight and 6:00 a.m. for work purposes if he had
    written permission from his surety indicating his whereabouts and the timeframe
    of his absence from his residence. A copy of any such written permission was to
    be retained by his surety.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant brought an application to exclude
    the seized evidence. The trial judge concluded that after excision and
    amplification, the ITO supported the warrants’ issuance. She dismissed the
    appellant’s application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge correctly set out the test for
    assessment of the ITO, citing <em>R. v. Pires;</em> <em>R. v. Lising</em>, 2005
    SCC 66, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 343, at para.&nbsp;8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The reviewing
    judge does not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge. If,
    based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified on the
    review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could have
    granted the authorization then he or she should not interfere. In this process,
    the existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence
    are all relevant, but rather than being a pre-requisite to review, their sole
    impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision
    of the authorizing judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge summarized the application of
    the test as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It must also be
    kept in mind that what the ITO must establish is a reasonably grounded belief
    that the offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking had been committed
    and that the search of the storage facility unit, Lexus, and the applicant’s
    home would afford evidence of the offence. The informant must establish
    reasonable grounds to believe that these statutory preconditions have been [<em>sic</em>:
    met]. The informant is not required to establish the statutory preconditions
    beyond a reasonable doubt, or even to establish a <em>prima facie</em> case.
    Reasonable grounds exist at the point that “credibly based probability replaces
    suspicion”.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge addressed the appellant’s
    arguments in turn. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was in fact a bail variance, but its terms
    allowed the appellant to be out past curfew for work purposes with written
    permission from his surety. The trial judge found the ITO was not invalid
    simply because the affiant attached the wrong recognizance conditions. She was
    not persuaded the affiant acted in bad faith; rather, he may have been unable
    to find the latest recognizance because it misidentified the date of the
    charges. Moreover, the warrants would have issued even if the proper
    recognizance had been attached. The affiant needed to show reasonable grounds
    to suspect drug possession, not that the appellant had breached the surety or
    curfew conditions of his bail. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence of the appellant’s Toronto charges did
    not have to be excluded from the ITO simply because they were not yet “proven”.
    However, evidence from the investigations did need to be excluded in this case
    because the Toronto judge concluded that the evidence was obtained in violation
    of s. 8: the police entered a hotel room without giving the occupants the
    chance to comply with a request to leave. The trial judge questioned the
    appropriateness of the rule requiring automatic excision of unconstitutionally obtained
    evidence from an ITO. If unconstitutionally obtained evidence can be relied on
    to convict the accused when admitted under s.&nbsp;24(2), it seemed incongruous
    that it could not form a basis for the issuance of a search warrant. She
    concluded however that she was bound by <em>R. v. Grant</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223,</span></em> to excise the
    evidence obtained in the Toronto investigations which resulted from <em>Charter</em> violations. In the instant case, police attached the judgment setting out those
    breaches of s. 8 of the <em>Charter </em>to the ITO. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following excision of the factual details
    resulting from the earlier <em>Charter</em> violations, the trial judge gave
    limited weight to the outstanding charges:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…[W]hat remains in
    respect of the outstanding charges is the fact that the applicant was alleged
    to have committed multiple charges of possession for the purpose of trafficking
    and other related offences with offence dates of December 29, 2013 and February
    18, 2014, and that it was anticipated that “there will be a finding of guilty
    registered on Wawrykiewycz’s next court date of February 14, 2017”. Although
    the excision of the underlying facts significantly limits the weight that can
    be placed on the outstanding charges, in my view the fact of the outstanding
    charges and the expected outcome of those charges, has some value, albeit very
    limited, and can be considered as a part of the information as a whole in
    assessing whether the justice could have issued the warrants. In my view, even
    if no weight were placed on the outstanding charges, there remained sufficient
    reliable evidence that provided a basis upon which the issuing justice could
    have issued the warrants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also ruled that the ion scan
    swab results did not need to be excised. The trial judge concluded that while
    the swabs constituted a search, they were authorized under the ancillary powers

    Analogizing to <em>R. v. Chehil</em>, 2013 SCC 49, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 220, which

    should have included information about the reliability of such swabs –
    particularly given the positive result from the control sample – there was no
    evidence of bad faith. The affiant disclosed and listed possible reasons for
    the positive control sample. His failure to mention false positives as a
    possible explanation was not reason enough to excise the test results or give
    them no weight. Considered as part of the evidence as a whole, the ion scan
    test results did not require a more detailed explanation before the issuing

    was not serious. First, although the Toronto judge found a s. 8 breach, he
    found the seriousness was tempered because the Toronto police acted in good
    faith and believed they were acting pursuant to law. That evidence was admitted
    under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. Second, the evidence sought to be
    excluded was linked only indirectly to the <i>Charter </i>infringing conduct:

  <p class=StyleHeading1Justified><span
lang=EN-CA>Appellant’s Position</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge mischaracterized his argument as a
    “piecemeal dissection” which analyzed each piece of evidence in isolation. In
    reality, the appellant pointed to multiple issues which – <span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA style='text-decoration:none'>taken together
    and in context</span></span> – mean the warrants were not properly issued.
    Further, the judge misapprehended key aspects of the evidence, as follows: </p>
  <p class=Heading>Bail conditions</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ITO referred to bail conditions which had been superseded by a subsequent
    variation. The trial judge’s finding that this was an honest mistake was
    unsupported by the evidence. The appellant alleges that the trial judge offered
    speculative excuses that this resulted from a typographical error in the bail
    variation, or that it was harder for police to obtain this information than it
    was for counsel’s assistant. In fact, the police could have obtained it through
    exactly the same means that counsel’s assistant did. The evidence suggests the
    police did not make good faith efforts or were negligent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also supposedly erred when she found the bail condition error did
    not impact the warrant’s issuance. While the search warrants were issued to
    investigate gun and drug trafficking, the entire investigation only started
    because the police <span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA style='text-decoration:
none'>suspected</span></span> a bail violation. Had the issuing justice been
    provided with the correct bail conditions, they would have called into question
    the need to continue surveillance of the appellant, and therefore the validity
    of the warrants.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Toronto charges</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that even without the information about the Toronto charges
    and the tracking warrant, there was enough information in the ITO to issue the
    warrant. However, the Toronto charges permeated the ITO. By the affiant’s own
    admission, the tracking warrant ITO was based on bias rather than factual
    information. The trial judge failed to acknowledge and consider the prejudicial
    impact of including this information in the ITO.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Swab evidence &amp; ion scan testing</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The information related to the swab of the
    appellant’s Lexus was an unconstitutional warrantless search and should have
    been excluded from the ITO. The trial judge erroneously focused on the <span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>purpose</span></span> of the
    swabs and found that the <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:
none'>possibility</span></span> of obtaining DNA evidence was irrelevant to the
    appellant’s reasonable expectation of privacy. The trial judge should have
    applied the reasoning in <em>R. v. Wong</em>, 2017 BCSC 306, and concluded the warrantless
    swabbing was an unreasonable search and seizure. A vehicle swab involves a much
    greater privacy interest than a dog sniff because of the potential collection
    of biological information. The trial judge should not have applied the
    reasonable suspicion standard from sniffer dog cases like <em>R. v. A.M.</em>,
    2008 SCC 19, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 569. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Alternatively, the trial judge erred in finding
    the police had reasonable suspicion of drug offences at the time of the vehicle
    swab. She did not properly consider the totality of the circumstances,
    including the “very limited value” of the appellant’s outstanding charges, and
    the “significantly limited” value of the Walmart conversation. The surveillance
    officer barely overheard the conversation and missed the most significant words
    indicating a drug transaction. Finally, the judge explained away the affiant’s
    failure to inform the issuing justice of the possibility of a false positive
    from the swab. The affiant simply provided reasons why the control swab may
    have given an accurate positive result. The issuing justice may have been left
    with an inaccurate impression of the reliability of the swab tests.</span></p>

    correctly found that after amplification and excision, the ITO contained
    sufficient information to issue the warrants. The responses to the appellant’s
    arguments are as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Failure to attach the most recent
    recognizance does not invalidate the ITO</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge properly noted that a mistake
    does not always indicate bad faith. Listing potential reasons for the officers’
    mistake did not amount to improper speculation on the part of the trial judge,
    and her passing comments have no bearing on the correct analysis she provided. Attaching
    the updated recognizance would have had no impact on the warrants. In <span
class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>the earlier release document</span></span>,
    the appellant was permitted out past curfew in the presence of his father or
    surety; in the later one, he was permitted out past curfew for work purposes
    with written permission from his surety. When police spoke with the father, he
    reported that he had not seen his son for two days, and there was no evidence
    that the appellant’s surety gave permission to break curfew for work purposes,
    or that the appellant was working. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor does the ITO’s sufficiency depend on whether
    the police’s <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>initial</span></span> suspicion of a bail violation proved correct. First, the police also suspected
    that the appellant was trafficking in narcotics, and initiated their
    investigation with this in mind as well as curfew violations. Second, baldly
    characterizing police error as negligence does not establish a reversible error,
    especially given the trial judge’s rejection of the assertion that the police
    acted in bad faith. The police’s initial reasons for investigation (or even
    negligence during the investigation) do not bear on the ultimate question of
    whether the ITO contained sufficient information to issue the warrants. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The judge properly handled the Toronto
    charges</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s argument that including the fact
    of the Toronto charges was “overly prejudicial” is flawed in two ways. First,
    the job of a reviewing judge is to determine whether the ITO contained
    sufficient information upon which the issuing justice could have issued the
    warrants – <span class=Underline><span style='text-decoration:none'>not</span></span> to speculate about the improper influence that excised evidence may have had on
    the issuing justice. Second, the trial judge actually <span class=Underline><span
style='text-decoration:none'>did</span></span> consider the prejudicial impact,
    noting that DC McGregor did not emphasize the underlying facts of the Toronto
    charges, disclosed the s. 8 violation found by the Toronto judge, and provided
    the Toronto judge’s reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The judge correctly found the ion scan swab
    was not an unlawful search</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While <em>Wong </em>is factually similar, the
    trial judge was not bound by a Supreme Court of British Columbia decision. In
    finding the search was justified on the lower threshold of reasonable suspicion
    the trial judge noted the appellant’s reduced expectation of privacy, the
    minimal intrusiveness of the search, and the lack of harm to the appellant’s
    dignity or autonomy. The presence of DNA on a swab does not expose intimate
    biographical information because such DNA is meaningless without an ability to
    decode it: see <em>R. v. Tessling</em>, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, at
    para. 28. That decision, which concerned the use of Forward Looking Infra-Red (“FLIR”)
    technology, noted that reasonableness must “be determined by looking at the
    information generated by <em>existing </em>FLIR technology” rather than its
    theoretical capacity. It was open to the judge to conclude there was no bad
    faith or material non-disclosure in the affiant’s failure to mention the
    possibility of a false positive. </span></p>

    the police reference to an outdated bail document was immaterial to the issue
    of whether grounds to search for drugs existed. That police attention was

    Toronto charges, and the police made full disclosure of the <em>Charter</em> violations associated with those charges. Moreover, police made full disclosure
    of the flaws associated with the earlier tracking warrant and did not rely on
    any evidence resulting from that investigative technique. Police made full
    disclosure of the positive control sample from the swab of the door handles and
    gave three possible explanations for it. The issuing justice was able to assess
    this evidence and evaluate its significance. The justice of the peace also
    would have been able to assess the degree of detail given about the drug-related

    sniffer dog search, and that it may therefore be conducted without a warrant if
    there is reasonable suspicion that the target is involved in a drug-related
    offence. As I shall explain, in the circumstances of this case, the swabbing of

    application of the law to a given factual matrix to determine whether a legal
    standard is met, attract a correctness standard: see <em>R. v. Le</em>, 2019
    SCC 34, 434 D.L.R. (4th) 631, at para. 23. While the underlying facts are
    reviewed for palpable and overriding error, the parties do not attack the
    factual findings of the trial judge on this issue. Therefore, her ultimate

    that does not require prior judicial authorization is reviewed on a correctness

    he parked in public is a normative, value-laden inquiry. The essential question
    is what degree of state intrusion into personal, territorial, and informational
    privacy can be tolerated without prior judicial authorization. As observed in <em>R.
    v. Patrick</em>, 2009 SCC 17, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 579, at para. 14, “[p]rivacy
    analysis is laden with value judgments which are made from the independent
    perspective of the reasonable and informed person who is concerned about the
    long-term consequences of government action for the protection of privacy.” Elsewhere,
    the Supreme Court has observed, “At the same time, social and economic life
    creates competing demands. The community wants privacy but it also insists on
    protection. Safety, security and the suppression of crime are legitimate
    countervailing concerns.”: see <em>Tessling</em>, at para. 17. </span></p>

    noted at para. 45,<em> </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>“</span></em>that
    while territorial privacy is implicated in this case, the <em>physical</em> intrusion by the police was relatively peripheral, and viewed in context, it is

lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here the appellant had some expectation of
    privacy in the vehicle. Although the vehicle was owned by his father, he was
    using it and had the ability to regulate access to it, and there is no suggestion
    he abandoned his privacy interest. By parking the vehicle in a public lot, he
    would reasonably expect that others, including police, would make observations
    of the car. Police could legitimately observe physical damage to the car, or
    evidence on its exterior such as blood spatter, without prior judicial
    authorization. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not conclude that any physical contact
    by the police with the car is necessarily a violation of a reasonable
    expectation of privacy. An officer might, for example, place a hand on the hood
    of a car to determine whether it is warm, that is, to determine whether the
    vehicle has recently been driven. This evanescent contact is not far beyond the
    casual contact patrons of a parking lot might incidentally have with other
    vehicles. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, I would hold that taking samples of
    residue left by a suspect’s hands on the handles of a vehicle, and subjecting
    those samples to chemical analysis, is an intrusion for which a warrant should
    be required. This investigative technique can reveal “intimate details of the
    lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.”: see <em>R. v. Plant</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 281,</span></em> at p. 293. These
    swabs presumably revealed whether the appellant had handled cocaine. I also
    agree with the observations in <em>Wong,</em> at para. 27, that privacy
    concerns are heightened because the swabs may also provide DNA samples for
    analysis by police, even if that is not why they were initially collected, or
    what they were used for. <em>Patrick</em> concerned police searches of a
    suspect’s curb-side garbage. Though the police were searching for evidence of
    drug offences, the potential for collection of DNA was also relevant to the
    privacy analysis: see para. 30. The court also expressed scepticism of the
    notion that privacy concerns are diminished because the search was targeted at
    contraband: see <em>Patrick</em>, at para. 32; see also <em>A.M.</em>, at para.
    73. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is unlike the emanations of heat released
    into the public sphere in <em>Tessling</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em> By themselves, such heat emanations revealed little about the occupants of the home
    and concerns mainly centered on the technology’s theoretical capacity to invade
    privacy. In the present case, while the swabbing was only carried out for the
    limited purpose of testing for the presence of cocaine, the technological
    capacity exists to subject swabs to other privacy-compromising analyses. In
    contrast, in <em>Kang-Brown</em> the odors were released into the public sphere
    and detected by a sniffer dog; no physical contact with the backpack was
    required, no samples were taken, and a sniffer dog generally cannot disclose non-targeted
    private information. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>A.M.</em>, at paras.
    74, 83: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he fact that the “sniff” only communicates
    the presence of contraband and does not disclose the nature or existence of
    other personal belongings is not without significance. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he dog’s
    communication capacity is limited to a positive alert or a failure to react at
    all. Unlike a wiretap or a physical search, the police do not obtain a lot of
    information about a suspect that is not relevant to their specific drug
    inquiry. While the suspect has a privacy interest in the place where the drugs
    are concealed, the fact that the sniff will disclose nothing except the
    presence of illegal drugs in that private place is a factor weighing in favour
    of moving the balance point to the reasonable suspicion standard.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, though the vehicle was in public view, any
    residue left by the appellant’s hands was not observable to a passerby and was
    in this sense private. As the trial judge concluded, the appellant had an
    objective and subjective reasonable expectation of privacy in the car, and more
    particularly, in the residue left by his hands on the handles of the car he was
    using. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given the privacy interests in the material
    transmitted from the appellant’s hands to the door handles, and given the
    degree of intrusion, sampling, and analysis, this is not a search for which
    reasonable suspicion could substitute for prior judicial authorization, as was
    the case in <em>Kang-Brown</em>. This was a warrantless search which was
    presumptively unreasonable: see <em>R. v. Collins</em>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265; <em>Hunter
    et al. v. Southam Inc.</em>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145. The presumptive requirement
    for prior judicial authorization remains. The onus rests on the Crown to
    demonstrate that the warrantless search was reasonable. Here there was no
    evidence about the accuracy or functioning of the ion scan equipment. A review
    of the jurisprudence suggests that its use has largely been confined to border
    searches. This was not a case of bodily residue or DNA left on abandoned personal
    property, or on public property, or on someone else’s property. There is no
    suggestion that exigent circumstances existed to justify the warrantless search. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the door handles and the analysis of those swabs were excised from the
    information to obtain, there remained a sufficient basis upon which the search
    warrants could have been obtained.</span></p>

    of drug offences and breach of recognizance, and was expected to be convicted
    on his next court appearance. He had engaged in what appeared to be a drug transaction
    and was overheard participating in what sounded like drug-related conversation.
    He was using and paying for a storage locker rented in someone else’s name, which
    he frequently visited for no apparent purpose, and he gained entry to the
    storage facility using a passcode associated with a different storage locker. He

    the bail variation error as an “honest mistake” was unreasonable, submits the
    appellant, as the evidence showed that the correct bail information was easily
    obtainable. At best the police were negligent, and the incorrect bail
    information led to the bail compliance investigation, which ultimately led to
    the drug trafficking charges. The appellant also argues that the trial judge’s
    rejection of bad faith is unreasonable given the police failure to address the
    possibility of false positives before the issuing justice. Further, the
    appellant submits that the trial judge excused DC McGregor for including
    information from the tracking warrant in the ITO, despite his acknowledgement
    that the tracking warrant was biased. Finally, the appellant claims that the
    swab test was a serious breach even if it was not deliberately unconstitutional,
    as it was done through inattention to constitutional standards.</span></p>

    citing <em>R. v. Lacasse</em>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089. The

    significant commercial enterprise involving large quantities of serious drugs
    that could potentially destroy many lives. The trial judge found the
    appellant’s motivation to be economic profit and greed, rather than addiction.
    His actions were clearly planned, deliberate, and part of a long-term organized

    methamphetamine and cocaine, and 60 grams of methamphetamine. These drugs, in
    these quantities, have the potential to cause serious harm in the community.
    $100,000 in currency was seized from the accused’s bedroom as well as 107
    rounds of ammunition from the storage locker. There was no evidence of other
    employment and the trial judge concluded that the appellant was at least a
    mid-level drug dealer engaged in a significant commercial enterprise in order
    to enrich himself, rather than feed an addiction. He was on bail for other
    serious drug offences at the time he committed the offences before the court,
    and in doing so he flagrantly breached the conditions attached to his release. This
    was not treated as an aggravating factor on the drug convictions, as the
    appellant was also being sentenced for the breach of recognizance, but it made
    the breach of recognizance particularly serious.</span></p>
