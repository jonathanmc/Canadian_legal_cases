  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After a lengthy jury trial, the appellants were
    convicted of murdering Darnell Grant. The appellants do not dispute their
    presence in the van from which emerged the shooters who killed Mr. Grant. The main
    issue at trial was whether they were the shooters. The appellants appeal their
    convictions. Mr. Smelie also seeks leave to appeal his sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants raise several grounds of appeal.
    They submit that the trial judge erred in qualifying Detective Douglas Backus
    as an expert witness and admitting his opinion that the appellants had
    characteristics of gang members for the purpose of establishing a motive for
    the shooting. Further, they argue the jury instructions were inadequate and incorrect,
    their applications for further disclosure were erroneously dismissed, the verdicts
    were inconsistent, and they allege a reasonable apprehension of bias on the
    part of the trial judge. They maintain that these errors resulted in an unfair
    trial and a miscarriage of justice. They ask that the convictions be set aside,
    and a new trial ordered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Respecting sentence, Mr. Smelie submits that the
    trial judge erred in fixing the length of his parole ineligibility by failing
    to acknowledge his youth and failing to make findings of fact that were
    consistent with the evidence and the verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to these submissions. As
    I will explain, the trial judge made no reversible error. This was a lengthy,
    difficult trial, complicated by numerous pre-trial and mid-trial applications. The
    trial judge showed patience and skill in keeping the trial on course. His rulings
    were clearly and fairly written. That he had to keep a firm hand on the rudder during
    this trial is exactly what was required of him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore dismiss the appeals.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To properly frame the grounds of appeal, I set
    out a brief factual background. Later in these reasons, I detail additional
    facts relevant to my analysis of each ground of appeal.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 22, 2008, at around 9:15 p.m., a stolen
    white van carrying the appellants drove into the Driftwood Court community
    housing area, an area of Toronto regarded as being within the territory of a
    gang known as the Driftwood Crips. Twice the van slowly circled the area and
    then stopped. Several men exited the van and immediately opened fire on a
    number of persons in the area including Mr. Grant and his friend Sonia Butler, discharging
    approximately 22 gunshots in as many seconds. They shot Mr. Grant in the back,
    killing him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gager testified that he just happened to be
    along for the ride. He said he bumped into an acquaintance at a pizza
    restaurant who invited him to a party. That is where Mr. Gager said he thought
    he was going when he entered the van. In the van, he saw Mr. Smelie in the
    passenger seat and “Tevane”,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> a man he knew from his neighbourhood.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gager testified that while he did not see
    Mr. Smelie leave the van, he saw him and others re-enter after the shooting. After
    the shooters re-entered the van, it sped off. They were almost immediately spotted
    and pursued by police. The van was abandoned, and its occupants fled on foot
    and scattered. Mr. Gager and Mr. Smelie were followed and ultimately apprehended.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Gager was arrested 45 minutes after the
    shooting while hiding behind a bush and attempting to dispose of a .45 class of
    firearm. He testified Tevane gave him the firearm for that purpose and told him
    to run. This firearm matched seven spent casings found near the shooting. One particle
    of gunshot residue was found on his t-shirt, which, as the Crown’s ballistics expert
    acknowledged, was inconclusive because it could have come from Mr. Gager’s
    proximity to the other shooters in the van.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On arrest, Mr. Smelie had six spent casings in
    his pocket. These casings matched and had to be ejected manually from a .357
    class of firearm located not far from where Mr. Smelie was arrested.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Four spent projectiles were recovered from the
    scene that were consistent with being fired from either a .357 class of firearm,
    or a .38 or 9 mm class weapon. A fifth spent projective matched the .45 calibre
    weapon found with Mr. Gager. The fatal projectile, recovered from Mr. Grant at
    autopsy, was consistent with being from a .357, .38 or 9 mm class firearm. Gunshot
    residue was found on Mr. Smelie’s hands. The Crown’s ballistic expert agreed
    that had he known that Mr. Smelie had handled the spent shell casings found in
    his pocket, he would expect to find gunshot residue on his hands.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While in jail awaiting trial for Mr. Grant’s
    murder, Mr. Gager wrote two letters to Anthony St. Louis, who was in another
    jail. Mr. St. Louis was connected to the Doomztown Crips, a distinct gang from
    the Driftwood Crips. Mr. Gager covered his letters in symbols and language characteristic
    of the Doomztown Crips and stated in one letter, “fuck driftwood”. Mr. Gager testified
    that he had only pretended to be part of the Doomztown Crips to obtain
    protection while in custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In one of his letters, Mr. Gager also wrote that
    Mr. Smelie “wants me to plead he must be smoking dope and I don’t kno[w] if
    [Mr. Smelie] might crack on me we just gone [<em>sic</em>] have to wait and see
    but I’ll fuck him up if he does.” He confirmed at trial that he meant that he would
    beat up or hurt Mr. Smelie if he said anything against him.</span></p>

    Smelie while they were in custody awaiting trial were seized. They contained
    handwritten gang symbols and language.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge heard lengthy pre-trial motions
    from November 2011 until the end of January 2012. The pre-trial motions
    focussed on issues including the admissibility of expert opinion evidence on
    street gangs and related disclosure issues, as well as addressing the
    appellants’ request to sit at counsel’s table, the admissibility of gunshot
    residue evidence, and the admissibility of Mr. Gager’s letters.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A jury was selected, and the trial commenced
    January 31, 2012. Trial counsel for both appellants brought a mistrial
    application on the second day of trial, February 1, 2012, alleging a reasonable
    apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge based on his demeanour and
    facial expressions. The trial judge immediately dismissed the application for
    brief oral reasons to which I shall return in more detail below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s case depended principally on the
    theory that Mr. Grant was killed in a gang-style shooting, perpetrated by gang
    members and motivated by gang rivalry. Specifically, the Crown submitted that
    the appellants were members of the Doomztown Crips, and that the shooting was
    part of a pattern of violence between rival gangs, the Doomztown Crips and
    Driftwood Crips. To support its theory, the Crown relied heavily on the expert
    evidence of Det. Backus concerning street gangs and gang membership and Mr.
    Gager’s letters. Det. Backus opined that the appellants possessed
    characteristics of members of the Doomztown Crips.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury convicted Mr. Gager of first degree
    murder and Mr. Smelie of second degree murder. Mr. Gager received a sentence of
    life imprisonment without parole eligibility for 25 years. The trial judge
    sentenced Mr. Smelie to life imprisonment without parole eligibility for 18
    years.</span></p>

    members about drugs and guns and attending a known gang meeting place known as
    “the Mansion”. The trial judge limited Det. Backus’ opinion to stating whether

    in Toronto street gangs generally and specifically regarding the Doomztown and

    was at one time a gang member, there was no evidence admissible against him concerning
    any animosity between the Doomztown and Driftwood Crips gangs. Without this evidence,
    Mr. Smelie maintains, Det. Backus’ evidence that Mr. Smelie had connections to
    a street gang served as nothing more than hugely prejudicial propensity
    evidence. Without the evidence of animosity between the two relevant gangs, Mr.
    Smelie submits that the gang opinion evidence had no logical relevance and

    approach recommended by Doherty J.A. in <em>Abbey</em>, at para. 76, a case
    dealing specifically with the admissibility of expert opinion on gang culture. At
    the first stage, the court must ensure that the basic preconditions for the
    admissibility of expert evidence are satisfied; if so, at the second or
    “gatekeeper” stage, the court must decide whether the evidence is “sufficiently

    reliability of this kind of expert testimony “depends heavily on the knowledge
    and experience of the expert, rather than the methodology or theory behind it”
    or factors like peer review and publication: <em>Abbey</em>, at para. 112,

    he qualified him as an expert, the trial judge refused to allow him to express
    his opinion that (1) the appellants were members of the Doomztown Crips; and
    that (2) the Doomztown Crips were in a gang war with the Driftwood Crips. He
    did not allow Det. Backus to rely upon confidential informant or occurrence

    trial judge permitted Det. Backus to tell the jury the aspects of the letters
    that, with the benefit of his expertise, he considered were characteristic of
    the author being a member of the gang. He was also permitted to impart to the jury,
    as context for the letters, his knowledge of gang hierarchy, as well as the
    typical interrelation between gang members themselves, and between gang members
    and non-gang members, including how, in his experience, such persons are likely
    or not likely to address one another. He was permitted to tell the jury of
    Anthony St. Louis’s connection to Doomztown such as it emerged from the intercepts
    to which he personally listened and of the telephone contact between Mr. Gager
    and Nicholas St. Louis, Anthony St. Louis’s brother, who was a known member of
    the Kipling Crips. He could mention any telephone intercepts he had personally

    the expert evidence he permitted Det. Backus to give was logically relevant

    his opinion on this point was lacking in foundation.</span></p>

    be qualified as an expert. He referenced the guiding principles that the
    exclusion of proffered expert testimony on the basis of bias is implicit in the <em>Mohan</em> factors and a matter of the trial judge’s residual discretion as
    gatekeeper after engaging in a costs/benefits analysis: citing <em>R. v. L.K.</em>,
    2011 ONSC 2562, 86 C.R. (6th) 98, at para. 9. The Supreme Court of Canada has
    since recognized that being properly qualified as an expert witness includes
    being willing and able to fulfil one’s duty to the court, which includes a duty
    of impartiality: <em>White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co.</em>,

    that while Det. Backus may have shown stubbornness in his testimony and some of
    his proffered opinions were so lacking in foundation that they were inadmissible,
    these shortcomings did not go to the core of his evidence nor establish a lack
    of partiality that required the exclusion of all his evidence. He was
    independent of any investigation into the offences and gave his evidence in a
    fair-minded fashion, including providing additional material sought by the
    defence at the preliminary inquiry, sometimes without being asked to do so. Any
    issues were attenuated by the limits placed on Det. Backus’ evidence and the
    rigours of cross-examination. These conclusions were open to the trial judge to

    R. v. G. (M.A.)</em> (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal
    refused, [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 524, he recognized that the evidence of bad
    character was relevant to motive and that provided the nature and scope of the

lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge’s instruction was adequate.
    He was dealing with a number of expert opinions grounded in both inadmissible
    hearsay collected by the experts in the scope of their expertise and inadmissible
    hearsay evidence from a party. The instructions as a whole alerted the jury to
    the fact that they may discount the weight attributable to an expert opinion to
    the extent it relies on inadmissible evidence. It followed the guidance <em>per</em> Wilson J., at para. 77 of <em>Lavallee</em>, that “[w]here the factual basis of
    an expert's opinion is a melange of admissible and inadmissible evidence the
    duty of the trial judge is to caution the jury that the weight attributable to
    the expert testimony is directly related to the amount and quality of
    admissible evidence on which it relies.” The trial judge’s instruction served
    this purpose.</span></p>

    imparted this instruction to the jury. In addition to the general instruction
    about experts, the trial judge strongly warned the jury about using bad
    character evidence in three midtrial instructions and in his final charge. As I
    will discuss in more detail later in these reasons, these instructions forbade
    the jury from relying on the portions of Mr.&nbsp;Gager’s letters that were not
    adopted by Mr. Gager in his testimony in their consideration of the case
    against Mr. Smelie.</span></p>

    judge that his flight from the van following the murder had no probative value.
    Mr. Gager testified that he was told to run by Tevane, who placed a firearm
    into his hands, and that he ran out of fear. As a result, his flight was as
    consistent with his dread of Tevane’s repercussions, and his fear of
    apprehension for breach of his bail conditions and the unlawful possession of a
    loaded handgun, as it was with guilt because of his participation in the
    murder. The trial judge therefore erred in failing to instruct the jury that
    his flight had no probative value.</span></p>

    instruction will be called for only in limited circumstances: <em>R. v. White</em>,
    [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, at para. 27. This reflects the exclusive fact-finding role
    of the jury to decide, on the basis of the evidence as a whole, whether the after-the-fact
    conduct of the accused is related to the crime before them rather than to some
    other culpable act, and how much weight, if any, such evidence should be given
    in the final determination of guilt or innocence. The trial judge must be
    careful not to interfere with or usurp that role.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    permitted to consider evidence of after-the-fact conduct is a fact-driven
    exercise dependent on the circumstances of each case. The trial judge must
    consider the question of what the Crown seeks to prove by means of the after-the-fact
    conduct evidence. Although no rigid formula emerges from the jurisprudence, such
    an instruction generally may be warranted where the accused has admitted to participating
    in a criminal act but has denied a specific level of culpability for that act: <em>White</em>,
    at para.&nbsp;28. The contrary is also generally true: a “no probative value”
    instruction is usually not required where the accused has denied any
    involvement in the facts underlying the charge at issue and has sought to
    explain his actions by reference to some unrelated culpable act: <em>White</em>,
    at para. 29.</span></p>

    guilt may be drawn from circumstantial evidence such as flight from the scene
    of a crime. It is important, however, that evidence of flight is not misused. A
    trial judge must take care to caution a jury against the danger of erroneously
    leaping from such evidence to a conclusion of guilty: see <em>R. v. Arcangioli</em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 129, </span><span

    the jury that they could only use Mr. Gager’s flight as circumstantial evidence
    that he was a willing participant in the shooting, if they first considered and
    rejected any other rational explanation for it. This included his fear of Tevane
    and his anxiety of apprehension for the serious criminal offence of possession
    of the .45 calibre pistol. He told the jury that they had to be very careful
    how they would use this evidence because such conduct was often equivocal at
    best and that they should reserve their judgment about the meaning of Mr.
    Gager’s flight until after considering all the evidence. The trial judge further
    instructed the jury that they could not use Mr.&nbsp;Gager’s flight as
    probative of the issue of whether Mr. Gager possessed the requisite intent for
    murder.</span></p>

    before the trial judge about the deleterious effect of the cumulative prejudice
    caused by counsel’s remarks. There was bad character evidence concerning Mr.
    Gager’s criminal record, his jailhouse letters, and gang membership. The
    remarks of Mr. Smelie’s counsel exacerbated the prejudice to Mr. Gager: he
    spoke of Mr. Gager’s violence and Mr.&nbsp;Smelie’s fear of him. As a result, Mr.
    Gager submits that the remarks were so prejudicial and rendered the trial so
    unfair that no corrective instruction could have been adequate. The trial judge

    necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice is a matter within the discretion

    agree with the trial judge’s observation that the late timing of the objection

    that the cumulative prejudice would be attenuated by appropriate jury

    were not evidence unless adopted as correct by the witness and the jury was
    specifically instructed to disregard that line of questioning. The jury was

    open to the trial judge to conclude that it was “possible that the jury would
    have understood [Mr. Smelie’s counsel’s] remark as referable to some
    retribution from gang members generally, as opposed to revenge by Mr. Gager

    that Mr. Gager obtained a benefit that he would not otherwise had obtained in
    that the instruction effectively neutralized the negative connotation of the

    dismissing the appellants’ two applications for further disclosure of various
    materials that they argued underpinned Det. Backus’ expertise and opinion.
    These materials included the Toronto Police Service’s confidential informant
    (“CI”) database, and intercepts and the informations to obtain (“ITOs”) from
    projects on which Det. Backus had been the lead investigator, namely, Projects
    XXX, Kryptic and Fusion. As a result, they said they were denied vital tools to

lang=EN-CA>The first defence application, commenced at the end of November 2011,
    sought disclosure of three things: (1) the CI database information on which the
    appellants submitted Det. Backus relied to formulate his opinion, (2)
    debriefing notes detailing information gathered from arrestees in the projects
    in which Det.&nbsp;Backus was involved, and (3) two slideshow presentations
    that he uses to educate other officers about gangs. The trial judge dismissed the
    application respecting the CI database on the basis that the material had
    marginal relevance, disclosure was unnecessary, and the interest in protecting
    CI privilege prevailed. The Crown was ordered to produce vetted copies of the
    debriefing materials and the slideshow presentations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    initially joined. The appellants sought hard-drive disclosure, in other words,
    the fruits of the entire investigation, including transcripts and wave files of
    each intercepted communication relied on by Det. Backus in Project Kryptic, as
    well as transcripts and wave files of the intercepted communications relied on
    by Det. Backus from Project XXX and Project Fusion. The appellants ultimately focused
    their submissions on the Project Kryptic intercepts and ITO material relevant

    in the possession of the prosecuting Crown, and not the fruits of the investigation
    in this case. He concluded that the Crown’s disclosure obligation was satisfied
    by the Crown’s voluntary disclosure of the 15-page excerpt of the ITO in
    Project Kryptic that summarized information and intercepted communications.
    Moreover, the trial judge observed that his decision not to permit Det. Backus
    to opine on the issues of Mr. Smelie’s membership in the Doomztown Crips, as
    well as the gang rivalry said to exist between the Doomztown and Driftwood Crips,

    determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that it could have impacted

lang=EN-CA>I do not accept that the trial judge did not allow for meaningful
    disclosure nor that the refused disclosure would have been relevant or useful

lang=EN-CA>Det. Backus relied on CI database information and hundreds of
    thousands of intercepts to formulate his general expertise and opinion on all
    aspects of gang membership, organization, operations and coded language. The particular
    basis of his proposed expert opinion had been disclosed to the appellants long
    in advance of trial. The appellants were provided with all Project XXX
    disclosure materials and intercepts as part of their disclosure package. In
    response to their disclosure applications, the Crown provided vetted copies of
    debriefs and a vetted copy of the PowerPoint presentations that Det. Backus presented
    in seminars to police officers, as well as the 15-page Crown summary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is no reason to challenge the trial judge’s conclusion that
    the disclosure of the CI database could not possibly affect the outcome of the
    trial. He correctly concluded that the CI database played an extremely minor
    role in the formation of Det. Backus’ general expertise. As the trial judge
    found, Det. Backus’&nbsp;expertise came from years of experience working the
    wiretap rooms of several major gang investigations and listening to intercepts,
    in addition to his experience as lead investigator reviewing wiretap
    affidavits, surveillance and seeing the culmination of that work in arrests and
    seizures. The appellants’ contention that the CI database could have provided
    some useful information is entirely speculative.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellants argue that the trial judge erred by denying

    basis to interfere with the trial judge’s finding that the privilege did in fact
    attach to the information in the database and that it had not been waived. In
    any event, he denied disclosure because he found that it could not possibly

lang=EN-CA>As referenced by the trial judge in his reasons, where the records

    not in possession of the prosecuting Crown, they are third party records as a
    matter of first impression: <em>McNeil</em>, at paras. 13, 25; see also <em>R.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge correctly concluded that the records
    were third party material. Although Det. Backus was the lead officer for Project
    Kryptic, the materials sought were “records created in the course of a
    different criminal investigation” and as such were third party records.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In any event, with respect to the portion of the Project Kryptic materials
    that were ultimately pursued on the second application, they related only to
    the issue of gang rivalry. The trial judge’s decision not to allow Det. Backus
    to opine on that issue effectively foreclosed any reasonable possibility that the
    disclosure would have any impact on the verdicts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Respecting Project XXX, the appellants had access to some transcript
    and call summaries and a much larger number of audio recordings. The intercepts
    could be searched by certain keywords. Det. Backus was willing to provide
    specific references to intercepts upon which he relied and to do whatever
    searches were required. Accordingly, I do not accept the appellants’ argument
    that the Crown failed in its obligation to provide reasonably accessible disclosure
    with respect to those intercepts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dealt with evolving late-breaking additional

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellants submit that the first degree murder verdict for Mr.
    Gager and the second degree murder verdict for Mr. Smelie cannot be reconciled.
    They suggest that the jury reached some sort of unjustifiable compromise, did
    not follow the trial judge’s instructions, or were confused by the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Specifically, the appellants say there was no difference in the
    evidence between them that would have justified the difference in verdicts: (1)
    both were in the stolen van at the time of the murder; (2) there were loaded
    firearms in the van; (3) the occupants of the van monitored the area in the minutes
    prior to the shooting; and, (4) while there was more recent evidence of Mr.
    Gager’s gang involvement because of his letters, there was also evidence on which
    the jury could infer that Mr. Smelie was still a gang member.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the appellants submit, if the jury accepted that Mr. Gager
    knew the murder was planned and deliberate, the jury must have accepted that he
    was a gang member. It is not possible to be in a stolen van with loaded
    firearms and knowingly and intentionally participate in the killing without
    knowing that the killing was planned and deliberate. On the evidence, Mr.
    Smelie must have had some prior awareness because he acted without hesitation.
    The jury’s verdict necessarily meant that Mr. Smelie was found to be a gang
    member and they necessarily implied a gang related motive. It was therefore impossible
    in these circumstances to convict Mr. Gager of first degree murder and Mr.
    Smelie of second degree murder.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>For Mr. Gager, the jury must have rejected his evidence that his
    presence in the van was accidental and his possession of the firearm forced,
    and that he later feigned gang membership while in custody awaiting trial in
    order to secure protection against rival gang members who threatened him. There
    can be no question that based on his letters, his presence in the van, his
    association and communication with other known gang members, and his possession
    of a firearm that matched spent gun casings at the scene of the murder, it was
    open to the jury to find that he was a gang member at the time of the shooting.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge correctly set out the governing legal principles for
    the jury to apply. The appellants did not object to this charge either at trial
    or on appeal. This instruction could have led the jury to have reasonable doubt
    about Mr. Smelie’s knowledge of planning and deliberation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The direct evidence of Mr. Smelie’s participation comes from Mr.
    Gager: (1) when he entered the van, Mr. Smelie was already in the front
    passenger seat; (2) the shooting happened as soon as the van stopped; and (3) Mr.
    Gager saw Mr.&nbsp;Smelie re-enter the van after the shooting. There is no
    evidence from Mr.&nbsp;Gager of any discussions in the van prior to the
    shooting. In my view, it was open to the jury to form a reasonable doubt that Mr.
    Smelie had concocted or been aware of a carefully thought-out scheme with time
    to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the intended action. That Mr.
    Smelie may have become aware of an attack moments before the killing does not necessarily
    meet the definition of “planned and deliberate”, nor does it mean that he had
    the requisite knowledge that the murder was “planned and deliberate” by the
    other participants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It was open to the jury to conclude that Mr. Smelie may have decided
    spontaneously to jump out and join the others. There was a wider basis for
    reasonable doubt as to planning and deliberation for Mr. Smelie than for Mr.
    Gager. There was stronger evidence of Mr. Gager’s gang involvement in the form
    of his letters and his admitted knowledge of the others in the van. The jury
    could reasonably have found on this record that the others decided that they
    would stop and shoot, and that Mr. Smelie decided to get out and participate
    and therefore was guilty of second degree murder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellants have not met their burden to demonstrate that on any
    reasonable view of the evidence the verdicts are inconsistent.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk36132912"><span lang=EN-CA>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants are not alleging actual bias but
    a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge. They say the
    trial judge was an active participant in the trial who unremittingly leveled
    unwarranted and angry criticism and corrections throughout the pre-trial
    motions and the trial. The appellants allege that the trial judge’s impugned
    conduct included non-verbal conduct related to tone and demeanour, which is not
    reflected in the record, that conveyed a derisive attitude by the trial judge
    towards the appellants and their counsel.</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellants submit that the trial judge rebuked both Crown and
    defence counsel, but that defence counsel was the disproportionate target of
    the trial judge’s ire. While, according to the appellants, most of the trial
    judge’s interventions occurred in the absence of the jury, the trial judge’s
    treatment of defence counsel served to belittle and intimidate them which had a
    chilling effect on their ability to represent the appellants’ interests at
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellants say that the cumulative effect of the trial judge’s
    entire conduct, including his summary treatment and dismissal of the
    appellant’s application for a mistrial on the second day of trial, gave rise to
    a reasonable apprehension of bias and an unfair trial. According to the
    appellants, a new trial is therefore required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In support of their application, the appellants seek to file as
    fresh evidence affidavits from trial counsel for the appellants. The appellants
    also seek to file materials from previous, unrelated trials at which
    allegations of unreasonable apprehension of bias were made against the trial
    judge. The Crown opposes the appellants’ application and filed evidence of the
    trial counsel for the Crown and the investigating officer who attended trial.
    Cross-examination transcripts of the affiants are also proffered.</span></p>
  <h6><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fresh Evidence</span></h6>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I turn first to the appellants’ fresh evidence application. In my
    view, the affidavits proffered by the appellants, as well as the
    cross-examination transcripts on these affidavits, are admissible in relation
    to the appellants’ reasonable apprehension of bias ground of appeal. They go to
    the issue of the fairness of the trial process and are compliant with the normal
    rules of evidence: <em>R. v. Shafia</em>, 2016 ONCA 812, 341 C.C.C. (3d) 354,
    at para. 157, leave to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 17. As a result, the
    Crown’s responding affidavits and the cross-examination transcripts on these
    affidavits should also be admitted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would not admit the materials from the other proceedings over
    which the trial judge presided. The appellants argue that this material is
    relevant because it goes to the reliability of their affiants by showing that
    similar allegations have been made against this trial judge in other
    proceedings. The appellants invite us, essentially, to use the purportedly
    similar allegations to support a finding that the trial judge engaged in
    similar conduct in this case. In other words, the evidence is effectively tendered
    to show a general disposition of this trial judge toward certain behaviour.
    While there will be cases in which evidence of a broader context may warrant
    admission, this is not such a case. Every trial is different. As the fresh
    evidence in this case is relevant only to the extent we engage in propensity
    reasoning, I would decline to admit it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The affidavits and the cross-examinations speak to the allegations
    of verbal and non-verbal misconduct by the trial judge. It is not necessary to
    itemize the allegations in these reasons, but they principally include
    allegations that the trial judge interrupted, displayed annoyance with and
    leveled critiques at trial counsel.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Because of the strong presumption of judicial fairness, impartiality
    and integrity that is not easily displaced, there is a high burden on the party
    alleging bias to prove on the basis of substantial grounds that there is a real
    likelihood or probability of the appearance of bias: <em>Yukon Francophone
    School Board, Education Area #23 v. Yukon (Attorney General)</em>, 2015 SCC 25,
    [2015] 2 S.C.R. 282, at para. 25; <em>Miglin v. Miglin</em> (2001), 198 D.L.R.

    [2003] 1 S.C.R. 303. As I explain, I am of the view that the appellants have

    comments or interventions must not be seen in isolation. Rather, the impugned
    conduct must be considered in the context of the circumstances and in the light
    of the whole proceeding. The inquiry is therefore inherently contextual and

lang=EN-CA>As Mr. Gager’s counsel on this appeal fairly acknowledged, the
    appellants would not likely have raised the issue of reasonable apprehension of
    bias solely on the basis of the trial judge’s alleged verbal interventions, as
    most of them were justified as being within his case management prerogative as
    trial judge. This is consistent with the comments of Lamer J. in <em>Brouillard
    Also Known As Chatel v. The Queen</em>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 39, at p. 44:</span></p>

    sometimes essential for him to do so for justice in fact to be done. Thus a

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I start with the last point – the trial judge’s handling of the
    mistrial application. The appellants did not file affidavit evidence at trial in
    support of the mistrial application but made submissions without prior notice that
    the trial judge should declare a mistrial. The appellants alleged that the
    trial judge was engaging in conduct demeaning to the defence such as rolling
    his eyes, sighing audibly, taking off his glasses in frustration, and not
    taking notes during cross-examinations conducted by the defence. Moreover, they
    asserted that the trial judge treated the defence unfairly by criticizing
    counsel, intervening during cross-examinations, and yelling at them, albeit the

lang=EN-CA>The trial judge declined to hear from junior counsel for Mr. Smelie
    and did not hear submissions from junior counsel for Mr. Gager. The Crown
    declined to make submissions after being denied the opportunity to seek
    instructions. The trial judge immediately dismissed the application with oral
    reasons. He denied engaging in any of the impugned conduct. He maintained he
    treated the defence and Crown equally. As for his demeanour, the trial judge
    stated that nature gave him a “stern visage” and that the jury would understand
    that the trial judge was “a cranky looking fellow”. He saw no trial unfairness.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I see no error in the trial judge’s handling of the mistrial
    application nor anything that would rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias
    or trial unfairness. Looked at in context, on the second day of trial, the
    trial judge was required during an ongoing jury trial to deal with an
    unexpected oral application without supporting materials and, until prompted by
    the trial judge, without a request for any relief. He patiently listened to
    counsel’s submissions. He was not required to hear from all counsel for the
    appellants when they confirmed their submissions would be the same nor allow
    the Crown time to seek instructions. He gave the appellants and the Crown an
    opportunity to be heard. His reasons dealt with all the issues that were raised
    by counsel. His response was appropriate in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the fresh evidence fails to demonstrate anything that
    would rise to the high level required to substantiate a reasonable apprehension
    of bias on the part of the trial judge. It speaks to defence counsel’s
    subjective and very general impressions of what occurred at a trial more than seven
    years before they swore their affidavits. Given the absence of any audio or
    video recording, it is not possible to assess directly the trial judge’s tone
    or his non-verbal demeanour of which the appellants complain. Moreover, this evidence
    as to the trial judge’s conduct is largely contradicted by Crown trial counsel.
    Even where this evidence is somewhat consistent, there is nothing in it that would
    even approach the kind of behaviour that would give rise to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias. Rather, the trial judge’s interventions principally served
    to render the trial more efficient and ensure that proper procedure, court
    decorum and the rules of evidence were being followed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Similarly, there is nothing in the voluminous transcripts of the
    trial proceedings that demonstrate anything but a trial judge who was anxious to
    protect the appellants’ fair trial rights, not to keep the jury waiting, and to
    keep the four-month proceeding on track. The appellants’ list of interventions
    appears immaterial when viewed over the course and in the context of four
    months of proceedings. This context includes, as well, instances where the
    trial judge sought to assist the appellants, such as, for example, when the
    trial judge offered on his own initiative to give a midtrial instruction to
    insulate Mr. Smelie from bad character evidence. Moreover, the hundreds of transcript
    pages devoted to counsel’s submissions not only indicate a respectful working relationship
    between the trial judge and counsel but serve as clear evidence of the trial
    judge’s patience and skill in dealing with the numerous and difficult issues
    that sometimes arose without any or very little notice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As Mr. Gager’s counsel stated in submissions during the mistrial
    application, a trial is not a tea party: see also <em>Groia v. Law Society of
    Upper Canada</em>, 2018 SCC 27, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 772, at para. 3. This is particularly
    the case in criminal proceedings where the stakes are so enormously high for
    the accused. Defence counsel must feel at liberty to forcefully protect their
    clients’ interests within the bounds of their professional obligations and the
    rule of law. A trial judge must intervene with caution so as not to create
    trial unfairness. At the same time, he or she has a right and an obligation to
    intervene to control the process, even to intervene to rebuke and correct
    counsel: <em>Marchand (Litigation guardian of) v. Public General Hospital
    Society of Chatham, </em>2000 CanLII 16946 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 154, leave to
    appeal refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 66; <em>R. v. Ibrahim</em>, 2019 ONCA 631, 147
    O.R. (3d) 272, at para. 97.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is no question that trial judges must endeavour to carry out
    their obligation to manage a trial in a courteous manner: <em>Mills</em>, at
    para. 234. However, we do not expect trial judges or counsel to be perfect.
    That is why context is so important. The test is whether the objective observer
    would conclude in the circumstances that the trial judge would likely not
    decide fairly or otherwise undermine trial fairness. The fact that the trial
    judge and counsel occasionally and admittedly showed some signs of impatience
    and frustration in the course of a very difficult four-month proceeding was
    entirely understandable in this case. I am satisfied in the circumstances that
    the trial judge’s interventions, viewed in context, come nowhere close to being
    discourteous, let alone establishing a reasonable apprehension of bias.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The record clearly demonstrates that there was no chilling effect on
    the ability of trial counsel to fully and ably represent the appellants.
    Indeed, appellants’ trial counsel had no difficulty in bringing forth
    applications, conducting examinations and cross-examinations, making objections,
    vigorously debating with the trial judge, and forcefully presenting closing
    argument to the jury. That the trial judge reminded counsel to stay on track
    and raised evidentiary and other legal and procedural issues was exactly what
    he was required to do as the trial judge. He had authority and discretion to manage
    the proceedings. He did so justly.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Mr. Smelie submits that the trial judge should have imposed a
    15-year period of parole ineligibility which would have been more consistent
    with that imposed for similar offences by similar offenders in similar
    circumstances. He says that the trial judge erred: (1) by failing to
    acknowledge or give any weight to the highly mitigating factor of Mr. Smelie’s
    youth – he was 20 at the time of the murder; (2) by finding that Mr. Smelie did
    not earn an honest wage but instead lived off gang activity, when there was no
    evidence to support that finding; and (3) by making findings that were
    inconsistent with the jury’s verdict of second degree murder – effectively
    sentencing Mr. Smelie for first degree murder.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I start with the well-settled principle that a trial judge’s
    decision on parole ineligibility is entitled to deference absent an error in
    law or principle, or unless it is demonstrably unfit: <em>R. v. Shropshire</em>,
    [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at paras. 43-53; <em>R. v. Kormendy</em>, 2019 ONCA 676,

    3 S.C.R. 1089, at paras. 11-12. I see no reversible error in the present case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge carefully considered the relevant criteria under s.
    745.4 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: the character of the offender; the nature
    of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission; and the
    recommendation of the jury: R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. He also recognized that “[i]n
    assessing these considerations and in deciding whether to increase the period
    of parole ineligibility all of the objectives of sentencing are relevant”: <em>R.
    v. McKnight</em> (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 9.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The parole ineligibility of 18 years imposed here was well within
    the range of similar offences for similar offenders in similar circumstances,
    as demonstrated by the trial judge’s review of the relevant case law. It also represented
    the approximate midpoint between the Crown’s position of 22 years and the
    defence range of 12 to 14 years of parole ineligibility. While the trial judge
    decried the heinous nature of the crime and placed it at the high end of moral
    culpability, he did not impose a sentence towards the highest possible end of
    the range. Moreover, it was below the majority jury recommendation on parole
    ineligibility: one juror recommended 15 years; eight jurors recommended 20
    years; and two jurors recommended 25 years.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was aware of Mr. Smelie’s youthfulness at the time
    of the offence, as he averted to his age in his reasons. He recognized that “rehabilitation
    cannot be ruled out”, though he found that “Mr. Smelie’s prospects in that
    behalf are [not] promising”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The latter conclusion, as well as the trial judge’s observations
    that “Mr.&nbsp;Smelie’s character is deeply flawed” and that he has been
    engaged in “a steady pattern of criminality interrupted only by periods of
    incarceration” were firmly rooted in the evidence. This evidence included Mr.
    Smelie’s criminal record of serious robbery and other offences, his gang
    activity, his participation in Mr.&nbsp;Grant’s senseless murder, and his
    institutional misconduct while incarcerated for the present offence.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that apart from one employment letter, “there
    is no other evidence before me that Mr. Smelie was employed in the years since
    he left school”. Mr. Smelie’s counsel did, in fact, make submissions that
    between 2004 and 2006, Mr. Smelie had worked for another company. The trial
    judge did not avert to this period of employment in his reasons; however, even
    if he had, it would not, in my view, have affected the appropriate period of
    parole eligibility. While there was some evidence before him that Mr. Smelie had
    been employed to some degree, the trial judge also found that he was involved
    in illicit drug dealing and gang activity. In the circumstances it was open to
    the trial judge to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that “Mr. Smelie lived,
    if not entirely, certainly principally on the avails of illegal gang activity.” </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Finally, I do not see anything improper about the findings of fact the
    trial judge made in characterizing the circumstances of the offence. As reflected
    in his reasons, the trial judge was well aware that in convicting Mr. Smelie of
    second degree murder, the jurors “were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that he both planned and deliberated upon the murder”, and the trial judge
    recognized that he was bound by that finding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge went on to grapple with when Mr. Smelie must have
    become aware of what was going to happen or when he decided to participate in
    it and concluded that he was unable to decide these questions on the evidence. He
    determined that “Mr. Smelie may not have given sufficient thought to the killing
    to be said to have both planned and deliberated upon it, as the jury was
    obviously satisfied Mr. Gager had done” but, whatever was Mr. Smelie’s mindset
    in the period preceding the shooting, the trial judge was satisfied beyond any
    reasonable doubt that “at the time Mr. Smelie took part in the shooting, he was
    fully aware of the motive underlying it, fully intent on killing the persons at
    whom he shot in pursuit of that motive, and knew full well that the other
    shooters were of a like mind”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Despite Mr. Smelie’s submissions to the contrary on this appeal,
    this is not the same as finding that Mr. Smelie planned and deliberated or that
    he knew that the other shooters had planned and deliberated, findings which
    would have resulted in his liability for first degree murder and therefore are
    precluded by the verdict. I see no error in the trial judge’s reasoning or
    conclusion, nor any inconsistency with the jury’s verdict of second degree
    murder for Mr. Smelie.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>In any event, the sentence was fit. As the trial judge correctly
    noted, the long litany of seriously aggravating circumstances surrounding the
    murder of Mr. Grant rendered predominant the sentencing principles of
    denunciation and deterrence. These circumstances included: (1) Mr. Smelie’s and
    the other shooters’ intent to kill as many people as possible who happened to
    be in Driftwood Court at the time of the murder; (2) the murder took place in a
    public area where it was only because of the shooters’ ineptitude that
    additional killings did not occur; (3) Mr. Smelie’s use of a restricted handgun
    in breach of the prior prohibition bans; (4) his previous criminal record
    including offences where an imitation firearm was used; (5) his flight from the
    scene and police; (6) his dangerous discarding of his firearm; and (7) the
    gang-related motive and circumstances in which Mr. Grant’s murder occurred. As
    the trial judge correctly noted, it is “hard to think of a crime that would
    show a more depraved indifference to the sanctity of human life.”</span></p>
