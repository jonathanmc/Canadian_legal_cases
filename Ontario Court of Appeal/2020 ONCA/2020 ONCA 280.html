lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applicant, J.J., applies for bail pending
    appeal. This is his second application; the initial order granting him bail
    pending appeal was revoked.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On April 18, 2019, the applicant was convicted
    of one count of sexual assault. On October 7, 2019, he was sentenced to three
    years in custody, in addition to four months’ credit for pre-sentence custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applicant applied for bail pending appeal.
    The Crown consented to his release. Bail pending appeal was granted by order of
    Fairburn J.A. dated October 18, 2019. The applicant entered into a recognizance
    in the amount of $7,500, with two sureties: his mother pledged $6,000; his
    sister $1,500. The terms of release required the applicant to live with his
    mother under house arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Notwithstanding that requirement, on November
    28, 2019, the applicant was arrested and charged with several new offences,
    including firearms offences, drug offences, and breaches of a probation order
    and of the recognizance signed on October 18, 2019 (the “November Charges”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown thereupon sought and obtained a
    revocation of the applicant’s bail pending appeal, by order of Miller J.A.
    dated December 16, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On December 19, 2019, the applicant’s bail
    hearing on the November Charges proceeded in the Ontario Court of Justice in
    Hamilton. Bail was set but not met. The Justice of the Peace determined that
    the applicant could only be released with a new surety who could establish his
    or her financial viability, to be approved in bail court. The terms set by the
    Justice of the Peace included 24/7 supervision and ankle monitoring.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On April 15, 2020, the applicant proposed two
    new sureties: D.T.D., who has been the applicant’s friend since elementary
    school; and his father, D.C.D. As sureties, D.C.D. pledged $14,000; his son
    pledged $1,000. Both proposed sureties were cross-examined by the provincial
    and federal Crowns and approved by a Justice of the Peace. A release order was
    granted.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applicant remains in the Hamilton-Wentworth

  <p class=Heading>POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown opposes the application on the basis
    that the applicant has not demonstrated that his detention is not necessary in
    the public interest: </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46, s. 679(3)(c). In particular, the Crown relies on the public
    safety component of the public interest criterion: </span><em>R. v. Oland</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para. 23. The Crown submits
    that the applicant’s failure to comply with the terms of his October 2019
    release signifies that a risk exists that he will commit further offences if
    released on bail pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The applicant submits that the strictness of his
    bail plan attenuates any such risk. The new sureties were found satisfactory by
    the Justice of the Peace who granted interim release on the November Charges.
    As well, the applicant’s bail plan requires that he: reside with his sureties;
    be in the visual presence of one surety at all times; remain in their residence
    at all times except for medical emergencies or when he is in the direct visual
    presence of a surety; wear an electronic ankle bracelet provided by Recovery
    Science Corporation (“RSC”); and enter into a monitoring agreement with that
    firm, which includes a requirement that the applicant provide photo
    verification of a surety’s presence each time he leaves the residence. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am not persuaded that the applicant has
    established that his detention is not necessary in the public interest.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The public safety component</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-US>The public safety component of s. 679(3)(c) of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code</em><span lang=EN-US> essentially tracks the requirements of s. 515(10)(b)
    governing an accused’s release pending trial: </span><em>Oland</em><span
lang=EN-US>, at para. 24. B</span>ail is denied only for those who pose a
    &quot;substantial likelihood&quot; of committing an offence or interfering with
    the administration of justice, where this &quot;substantial likelihood&quot;
    endangers &quot;the protection or safety of the public&quot; and when it is
    &quot;necessary&quot; for public safety: <em>R. v. Morales</em>, [1992] 3
    S.C.R. 711 at p. 737. As was noted in <em>Morales</em>, at p. 738:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he bail system also does not function properly if
    individuals commit crimes while on bail. One objective of the entire system of
    criminal justice is to stop criminal behaviour. The bail system releases
    individuals who have been accused but not convicted of criminal conduct, but in
    order to achieve the objective of stopping criminal behaviour, such release
    must be on condition that the accused will not engage in criminal activity
    pending trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Several reasons lead me to conclude that even
    under the applicant’s new bail plan there exists a substantial likelihood that
    he will commit a criminal offence that would endanger the safety of the public.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first involves the November Charges. The
    October 2019 order of Fairburn J.A. required the applicant to reside with his
    sureties – his mother and sister – and remain in their residence at all time
    except for medical emergencies or “unless you are in the presence of either of
    your sureties.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police synopsis of the November Charges
    states that on the evening of November 28, 2019 members of the Hamilton Police
    Service were monitoring a known drug house when a car parked in front of the
    house. A person left the house, entered the car, and the car went on its way.
    The police pulled the car over at 10:49 p.m. Five persons were in the car. The
    applicant was in the front passenger seat. A glass pipe with suspected cocaine
    residue was observed in plain view in the vehicle. A clear baggy of white
    powder fell to the ground from the back seat when the occupants left the car. A
    search of the vehicle disclosed a backpack on the back seat that contained a
    loaded handgun. Baggies containing what was believed to be fentanyl and heroin
    were also found.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The police synopsis states that the applicant
    was bound by two firearms prohibitions and two probation orders. He was charged
    with two counts of possession contrary to order, two counts of breach of

    was also charged with drug offences.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As applicant’s counsel points out, the applicant
    is presumed innocent of committing the new charges until proven guilty. However,
    as the December 16, 2019 endorsement of Miller J.A. records, at that time
    applicant’s counsel conceded that the test for revocation of the release order
    and cancellation of the recognizance had been met by reason of the November Charges. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The terms of the October 2019 release order of
    this court required the applicant to be in presence of a surety if he left his residence
    for a non-medical emergency. The evidence strongly indicates that the applicant
    was not on the evening of November 28, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, evidently the financial consequences to
    his mother and sister of breaching his recognizance were not sufficient to
    dissuade the applicant from leaving their presence. Notwithstanding the
    assurances given by the applicant in his most recent affidavit to abide by the
    directions of his sureties, his track record does not give me confidence that
    he will do so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I come to this view not only based on the events
    underlying the November Charges, but also on the basis of the applicant’s
    criminal record. In his affidavit, he acknowledges that he has a criminal
    record in addition to the sexual assault conviction that is the subject of his
    appeal. As a youth, the applicant was convicted of assault (2011), theft under
    $5,000, failure to comply with an undertaking, and possession of stolen
    property (under $5,000) (2013). As an adult, he was convicted of simple drug
    possession (2016), and he pleaded guilty to breaking and entering and was
    sentenced to four months in jail (2019). For purposes of assessing the public
    safety factor, the existence of a conviction for failure to comply with an
    undertaking is troubling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the police synopsis records that a loaded
    handgun was found in the car on the evening of November 28, 2019. Whether the
    Crown can establish that the applicant had the knowledge and control required
    to prove possession of the handgun is a matter for a later trial. But, for
    purposes of this application, it is a relevant factor that the applicant, who
    was to be in the presence of a surety, apparently was in a car with others
    where a loaded handgun was present.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, the younger of the proposed sureties, D.T.D.,
    was convicted five years ago of mischief under $5,000 and failure to comply
    with an undertaking. I accept the Crown’s submission that while those
    convictions do not tip the scale against the suitability of D.T.D. as a surety,
    the conviction for failure to comply with an undertaking should be of concern
    to the court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fifth, I have read the materials filed by the
    applicant from RSC. The monitoring service it offers uses a GPS ankle bracelet
    attached to the applicant and provides real-time information about the
    applicant’s location, as well as periodic compliance reports.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are limits to the practical effectiveness
    of the RSC service. In a document titled, “Overview of Criminal Programs”, the
    company states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>In our view, monitoring ought not to be relied upon if the
    required standard is to prevent violations or to ensure an immediate police
    response. Rather, monitoring is best thought of as a risk management tool - it
    cannot prevent an accused from fleeing nor can it guarantee police intervention
    in a breach or offence in progress.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>RSC makes a similar point in a document titled,
    “Radio-Frequency (RF) &amp; GPS Monitoring for Criminal Cases –</span><span
lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>Program Summary”, which states:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>16. While the system can and does deliver violation alerts very
    quickly, typically in 1-10 minutes, we do not encourage reliance on rapid
    police response time as a factor in making a decision to release rather than
    detain an accused. This is for two reasons: firstly, because there are many
    factors that create the potential for delay in the chain of communications that
    lead from a violation event to the ultimate police response and, secondly,
    because even when there are no such delays and the police response is
    immediate, that may still not be sufficient to prevent an accused from fleeing
    or committing an offence.</p>
  <p class=CQuote>17. These considerations regarding response time lead us to
    encourage decision makers to view monitoring not as a prevention tool but as a
    risk management tool that, in some cases, can have a significant impact on a
    plan’s ability to meet the applicable legal requirements…</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In </span><em>R. v. Fleming</em><span
lang=EN-US>, [2015] O.J. No. 4380 (S.C.J.), Trotter J. (as he then was),
    pointed out at para. 18 that GPS monitoring only reveals where a person is, not
    what he is doing. As observed by Hourigan J. (as he then was) in </span><em>R.
    v. Palijan</em><span lang=EN-US>, [2012] O.J. No. 6549 (S.C.J.), at para. 25, a
    company such as RCS focuses on gathering evidence of compliance, not preventing
    non-compliance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The weight to be given to an applicant’s
    willingness to enter into a GPS monitoring program with a company such as RCS
    will depend on the specific circumstances of a case: </span><em>R. v. Sotomayor</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2014 ONSC 500, at para. 41, fn. 1. In the present case, I am not
    persuaded that the proposed GPS monitoring program significantly reduces the
    likelihood of the applicant </span>committing an offence that will endanger the
    safety of the public. While a GPS monitor can record the presence of the
    applicant at a specific location, such as the one where the events of November
    28, 2019 are alleged to have occurred, it cannot provide a quick response that
    would prevent such events. As well, the applicant does not have an unblemished
    record of complying with court orders. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Taking the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied that the
    applicant has established that his release plan would reduce the risk of him
    re-offending. On the contrary, I conclude that the evidence demonstrates that a
    substantial risk exists that the applicant would commit a criminal offence that
    endangers public safety if released pending his appeal. I conclude that the
    public safety considerations are sufficient to warrant the continued detention
    of the applicant in the public interest.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The public confidence component </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the Crown does not rely on the public confidence
    component of s. 697(3)(c), the applicant did file evidence about the merits of
    the appeal. He also filed some evidence regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. As
    stated in <em>Oland</em> at para. 27, the public safety and public confidence
    components are not to be treated as silos for a public interest analysis. I
    therefore will consider the evidence concerning the strength of the applicant’s
    appeal, as well as that concerning COVID-19: at para. 40.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant’s conviction for sexual assault concerned events
    that took place when he was 20 years old and the complainant 15 years old. Both
    had been drinking at a party. There is no dispute that sexual intercourse took
    place between them. The only issue is whether the intercourse was consensual.
    The complainant testified that it was not, and that she had screamed for the
    applicant to stop. The applicant testified that the complainant wanted to have
    intercourse.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant contends that there were inconsistencies and
    contradictions in the evidence of both the complainant and himself. His
    contends that the trial judge committed several errors: he discounted material
    inconsistencies and a deliberate falsehood in the complainant’s evidence; he
    improperly used post-offence conduct of the applicant, including a text the
    applicant sent to a friend about the incident; and he relied on impermissible
    stereotypical reasoning about the circumstances under which a 15-year old
    female would be interested in having sex in rejecting the applicant’s version
    of events as implausible.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The record available to assess the strength of the applicant’s
    grounds of appeal is, at this point, limited to the trial judge’s reasons.
    Transcripts of the evidence of the complainant and the applicant are not yet
    available. As a practical matter, the absence of those transcripts makes it
    difficult to assess the impact of the inconsistencies and contradictions raised
    by the applicant within the context of the entirety of the witness’ evidence,
    especially in the circumstances of a “he said/she said” case like the present
    one.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The applicant attempted to re-open his trial prior to sentencing,
    relying on evidence not led at the trial from a young woman who knew both the
    complainant and the applicant. The applicant submitted that the evidence would
    undercut that of the complainant. However, the applicant’s notice of appeal and
    argument on this application does not suggest that a motion for leave to adduce
    fresh evidence will be brought or that the trial judge erred in refusing to
    re-open the trial to admit such evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown does not dispute that the applicant’s appeal is not
    frivolous. However, I am not persuaded that the merits of the applicant’s
    appeal are such that they tip the scale against continued detention in light of
    the substantial risk to public safety that I have identified.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally, the applicant submits that his
    continued incarceration during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic is broadly
    relevant to the public interest analysis. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The fact of the current COVID-19 pandemic is a
    factor that can be taken into account in considering the public interest
    criterion: </span><em>R. v. Omitiran</em><span lang=EN-US>, 2020 ONCA 261, at
    para. 26. The weight played by that factor depends upon the particular
    circumstances of each case. For example, it might play a role where an
    applicant’s known or documented health conditions, including his age, place him
    within a vulnerable group that is more likely to suffer complications and
    require hospitalization if he contracts the virus: </span><em>R. v. Kazman</em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2020 ONCA 251, at para. 17.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, the applicant is detained
    in the Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre. He is 23 years old. His affidavit
    does not disclose any medical condition that puts him in a group with increased
    vulnerability to the effects of COVID-19. While his counsel’s supporting
    affidavit states that in late March one employee at the Hamilton-Wentworth Detention
    Centre tested positive for the virus, the applicant’s record does not contain
    evidence of a significant COVID-19 outbreak at the facility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Consequently, I do not see the fact of the COVID-19
