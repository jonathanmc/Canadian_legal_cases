    in writing on consent of the parties pursuant to the March 17, 2020 COVID-19:
    Notice to the Profession and the Public.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    trial, the appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual assault, two counts
    of assault and one count of criminal harassment. He was sentenced to a total of
    seven years’ imprisonment, less 240 days’ credit for pre-sentence custody. He
    appeals against the convictions for sexual assault and assault and seeks leave
    to appeal the sentences imposed for those offences. The main issue raised on
    the conviction appeal is whether the trial judge erred by applying different
    standards of scrutiny to the Crown and defence evidence. Although not framed as
    a ground of appeal, the appellant also submits that the trial judge repeatedly
    interrupted defence counsel at trial's cross-examination of the complainant,
    causing defence counsel to retreat from lines of questioning. Concerning
    sentence, apart from asserting that the sentence imposed was harsh and
    excessive in all the circumstances, the appellant makes no submissions.</span></p>

    of the relationship between the appellant and the complainant, S.S. According
    to the complainant, the two met about nine years prior to the 2018 trial when
    her aunt brought the appellant to the complainant's house because he was
    looking for a prostitute. The appellant was 14 years older than the
    complainant. The complainant was a crack addict. She said the appellant
    supplied her with drugs and money in exchange for sex. Over the years, their
    relationship became something of a friendship, albeit a toxic one.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The complainant alleged
    that the appellant forced her to have anal intercourse on two occasions, once
    at a crack house around Halloween 2015, and once at a motel in late February or
    early March 2016. According to the complainant, after the first incident, she
    tried to attack the appellant. He struck her in the face and tried to flip her
    over a fence. The complainant also alleged that, sometime before the second
    incident, the appellant pushed her onto her knees and demanded that she perform
    oral sex on him after giving her some crack. When she refused to do so, the
    appellant urinated on her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    testified that she avoided the appellant after the motel incident. In April
    2016, the complainant and her boyfriend had moved into the complainant's
    mother's house and the complainant was attending school. The appellant called
    the complainant's mother's house several times while parked outside the house
    and later followed the complainant and her boyfriend while they were riding on
    a bus. When the appellant attempted to follow the complainant into a
    convenience store, the store clerk locked the door and called the police. On being
    interviewed by the police, the complainant disclosed her allegations about the
    sexual assaults and assaults. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    complainant wrote letters recanting her allegations on two occasions prior to
    trial. The first occasion was in November 2016. According to the complainant,
    despite a no contact order, she and the appellant were in constant contact
    following his arrest and prior to the preliminary inquiry in July 2017. The
    appellant offered the complainant $40,000 as a down payment on a house in
    exchange for writing a recantation letter. The complainant wrote the letter
    while on drugs in accordance with the appellant's instructions. She testified
    that she and the appellant looked at houses together but he did not give her
    the money. He asked her not to attend the preliminary inquiry but she was off
    drugs at that point and went in any event. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    second recantation letter in April 2018. She said the appellant gave her a
    couple of hundred dollars and his credit card to use. He also paid some rent on
    a storage space she was renting. The complainant was living in shelters at the
    time and had relapsed into drug use. She explained that the appellant took her
    to a resource centre and stood over her as she typed the letter and then drove
    her to drop it off. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>On June 25, 2018, the
    complainant attended a meeting with the Crown and the officer-in-charge. She
    said she had been doing drugs with the appellant the night before, that he paid
    her money, and that she went to the meeting to have the charges dropped. She
    admitted lying to the police during this interview. However, she said she realized
    it was wrong within one or two days and called back and asked for another
    meeting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    at trial and denied the complainant's allegations of sexual assault and
    assault. He also maintained that his actions in April 2016 did not amount to
    criminal harassment. </span></p>

    Canada in January 2008. He testified he was introduced to the complainant in
    late 2009 through a woman he met at a grocery store. For several months, he
    paid her to teach him English. After about 10 months, their relationship became
    sexual. The appellant claimed to have fallen in love with the complainant
    around 2013. He denied giving her money or drugs in exchange for sex. He also
    denied having committed the offences. Although he acknowledged being aware that
    the complainant was writing the recantation letters, he denied giving her money
    to write them.</span></p>

    inconsistencies between the complainant's trial evidence and her preliminary
    inquiry evidence and statements to the police. However, she concluded the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have also considered the evidence of the
    accused, who has emphatically denied ever having committed any of the offences.
    I found him to be an evasive and unresponsive witness. Frequently, rather than
    answering questions, he chose to make disparaging comments about the
    complainant. When confronted about what he had said previously to the police,
    he often resorted to claims about communication difficulties flowing from his
    lack of understanding of the English language. While I need not, and cannot
    accurately comment on his English proficiency, it appeared to me that he used
    this as an excuse for any prior statement from which he wanted to distance
    himself. Repeatedly, while the complainant testified, I observed the accused to
    openly scoff at her evidence in a demeaning manner, showing indifference to her
    and undermining the credibility of his claims of loving her. I find he was not
    only smug, arrogant and condescending about the complainant, but also that his
    evidence often made little sense, was internally inconsistent and was not
    credible.</span></p>

    appellant says he made comments that could be described as disparaging on only
    four occasions during a lengthy cross-examination and that none of these
    comments were unresponsive to the question asked or formed the whole of his
    answer. In contrast, the complainant made many more comments that were
    disparaging of him or his counsel. Yet the trial judge did not find the

    says it was an error in law for the trial judge to rely, in part, on his
    demeanour outside the witness box to negatively assess his credibility. The
    trial judge drew a negative inference from the appellant's conduct in
    &quot;scoffing&quot; at the complainant while she testified. The appellant

    complainant, the appellant asserts the trial judge applied an overly generous
    level of scrutiny to her evidence in concluding that her recantations were not
    truthful while finding her evidence concerning the allegations was true. In the
    face of her evidence that she was prepared to recant for a pay-off, it was
    surely an equally reasonable inference that she fabricated the allegations to
    extort a pay-off. </span></p>

    submits that when assessing the recantations, the trial judge erred in finding
    the complainant's credibility was enhanced by her candour and the fact
    &quot;that she did not downplay her complicity in what she now acknowledges was
    a plot of deception&quot;. As this court recently observed in <i>R. v. Kiss</i>,

    evidence of a toxic, manipulative and exploitive relationship with the
    appellant. Given that evidence, it was open to the trial judge to consider her

    cross-examination when he was confronted with various inconsistencies between
    his evidence at trial and his statement to the police and potential
    implausibilities in his evidence. Considered in the context in which they were

    taking drugs and that if she really loved him they would get married. The
    appellant testified that he had never offered to become boyfriend and
    girlfriend with the complainant and that she had rejected the concept of
    marriage. After being confronted with a portion of his videotaped statement to
    the police in which he had said he asked her to become boyfriend and
    girlfriend, the appellant first explained his request had been prior to her
    involvement in an accident. When asked what had changed, the appellant
    responded he was a refugee in this country and had no documents. When asked why
    he went from wanting to be in a relationship with the complainant to not
    wanting to be in a relationship with her he said he did not understand the
    question. When the question was repeated, the appellant responded, &quot;in

    C.C.C. (3d) 421, at paras. 50-69, there are several reasons why such a practice
    should be avoided. Among other things, an accused person likely has no
    expectation of being judged while seated in the courtroom and no opportunity to
    explain whatever observations are made by the trial judge. In addition, the
    trial judge has no baseline for comparing the accused's reaction to whatever

    persuaded that the trial judge's reference to the appellant's demeanour outside
    the witness box gave rise to a miscarriage of justice in this case. The trial
    judge gave lengthy reasons analyzing the evidence presented and made detailed
    findings of credibility based on the evidence. Although the reference was made
    as part of the trial judge's opening summary of her conclusions, no further
    reference was made to this factor as part of the trial judge's subsequent

    several paragraphs of her reasons to discussing the complainant's two letters
    of recantation and what the complainant described as her lies to the
    officer-in-charge on June 25, 2018. Ultimately, she accepted the complainant's
    explanations of drug use and the appellant's manipulation and offer of payment
    of $40,000 as the down payment for a house to conclude that the recantations
    and statements to the officer-in-charge were lies and the complainant's
    in-court testimony was the truth. The trial judge explained her reasoning, in
    part, as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The recantation letters and lies to [the

    complainant is a person who lies to advance her interests as is alleged…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>She has provided what I find to be a
    plausible, credible explanation for why she lied and recanted her allegations
    in the manner that she did. I accept her explanation. It makes sense and is
    logical in the context of her relationship with [the appellant] and where she
    was at in her life when she was using crack and had very low self-esteem. It
    fits with the rest of her evidence and the evidence as a whole. She exhibited
    candour and what I find to be genuine embarrassment when she explained how she
    felt manipulated to recant for the promise of a sum of money that would have
    changed her life. I find that she did not downplay her complicity in what she
    now acknowledges was a plot of deception. She acknowledged her personal
    weakness and her role fully, a fact that I find further enhances her
    credibility.</span></p>

    judge carefully and thoroughly considered the evidence and arguments relating

    trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence for reasons that she explained.
    Concerning her reliance on the complainant’s candour and the fact that the
    complainant did not downplay her complicity in the events, this is not a case
    like <i>Kiss</i>, on which the appellant relies. In <i>Kiss</i>, the
    complainant gave evidence that either made no sense or was “curious” in the
    context of her narrative of the events and that tended to support, at least to
    some extent, the appellant’s version of events. The trial judge credited the
    complainant for her candour without considering the difficulties it presented
    to the complainant’s narrative. It was in this context that Paciocco J.A. said: </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>&quot;admitting a difficult

    October 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. The first message included the statement

    message was that the complainant had slit the tires on a car in the appellant’s
    driveway, that she almost felt she should let the appellant get away with what

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have considered the suggestion made by the
    defence that the complainant’s credibility [is] undermined by the fact that she
    is said to have behaved in a manner inconsistent with having been sexually
    assault[ed] in the years after the alleged offences, particularly as
    demonstrated by what appear to be loving Facebook messages.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The law is very clear that the credibility of
    a sexual assault complainant is not to be assessed by comparing how that
    complainant behaved with stereotypical assumptions about how such a complainant
    usually behaves or should behave. There is no rule to be applied as to how
    sexual assault victims should or will behave. More specifically, with respect
    to this case, it is legally impermissible to infer from the fact that the
    complainant maintained contact with the accused after the alleged offences,
    even though that contact included kind and loving sentiments, that she is less
    credible in her allegations: <i>R. v. A.R.J.D.</i>, [2017] ABCA 237 at paras.

    that <i>A.R.J.D.</i>, as affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada, stands for
    the more limited proposition that it is an impermissible stereotype to “expect
    that a victim of sexual abuse would demonstrate behaviours consistent with that
    abuse or at least some change in behaviour such as avoiding the perpetrator”.
    In other words, a failure to avoid the perpetrator cannot be the subject of a
    presumptive adverse inference. However, relying on <i>R. v. D.M.</i>, 2019 ONSC
    4001, the appellant argues that evidence of continued communication between a
    complainant and an accused following an alleged sexual assault is not
    automatically irrelevant. He asserts that the complainant’s post-offence
    messages to the appellant in this case provided an evidentiary basis for a
    negative assessment of her credibility.</span></p>

    the complainant’s explanations for the communications, which were accepted by
    the trial judge, the complainant’s contact and communications with the
    appellant following the alleged events could not adversely affect her
    credibility.</span></p>

    mitigating factors present (which in the latter case included the appellant’s
