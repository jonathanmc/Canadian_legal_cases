    interference (</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 46, s. 151(a)), sexual assault (s. 271), and
    sexual exploitation (s. 153(1)(a)). The first two charges alleged sexual
    touching during the earlier years. The sexual exploitation charge involved sexual
    intercourse in the later years, after the complainant was 12 or 14 years old.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was found not guilty of sexual
    exploitation. Although the trial judge found the complainant to be a credible witness,
    she concluded that the evidence relating to this time period was “not
    sufficiently reliable”. However, the trial judge found the appellant guilty on
    the other two charges, relying heavily on the complainant’s prior consistent
    statements to her sister and her mother, as well an incident where, upon
    hearing of the complainant’s allegations, her biological father threatened the
    appellant.</span></p>

    order a new trial. The distinction that the trial judge made between the two
    time periods, while somewhat delicate, was one that was available on the
    evidence. However, the trial judge’s differential findings rested on the misuse
    of the complainant’s prior consistent statements and the threatening incident. Although
    they were admissible to rebut an allegation of recent fabrication, the trial
    judge strayed further and found that the statements provided “the reliability
    necessary to support [the complainant’s] testimony” and that the threat “lends
    support to what was happening in the family at the time”. The improper use of this
    evidence formed an important part of the trial judge’s overall analysis and
    must result in a new trial.</span></p>

    she took Ritalin. Her mother described her as “slow’. The trial judge described
    the complainant as having “limited cognitive ability” and “still very much a
    child”. The complainant is now married and has children of her own.</span></p>

    she was often drowsy from taking Ritalin and would rest in her bed before dinner.
    Late one afternoon, the appellant came into her bedroom and touched her vagina
    while he masturbated. The complainant’s mother was out of the house at the time,
    as were the other children. The appellant told the complainant he would hurt
    her and deny what he did if she ever told anyone. The complainant testified
    that this touching occurred two or three times a week, if not more, “every time
    my mom would go out.” </span></p>

    to 12 ½ (which would have been in late-1993/early-1994), the appellant started
    to penetrate her with his penis. The first time this happened the other
    children were outside playing, while her mother was at bingo. The appellant
    came to her room and said, “It’s time.” He penetrated her while wearing a
    condom. After ejaculating, he left the bedroom, renewing his threat to hurt her

    when she was home. During this period of time, the complainant periodically ran
    away from home. She stayed in group homes and treatment centres, as well as
    with friends. She accumulated a criminal record. The complainant became
    pregnant by her boyfriend and moved back home. She testified that, after she
    gave birth to this child, the appellant attempted sexual intercourse with a

    disclosed the abuse following a doctor’s visit. Because the complainant had a
    learning disability and behavioural problems, S.M. took her to the doctor. S.M.
    explained that the doctor said, “there’s something going on in her life that
    she’s not telling us. And when I question, she came and told me that her dad
    was touching her.” On the other hand, S.M. described an incident when she heard
    the appellant say something to the complainant, who responded by saying, “‘I’m
    telling mom what you’re doing.’ And she came to me and told me that dad was
    coming in her room at night and touching her.”</span></p>

    something about being touched on the leg. When S.M. confronted the appellant,

    alleged touching. The CAS records note her wishes to not be at home if the
    accused was there. <u>Her disclosure to her mother and sister is consistent
    with their testimony and their description of her demeanour of fear, tension,

    period, the appellant was alleged to have repeatedly touched the complainant’s
    vagina; in the second time period, the allegations included sexual intercourse.

lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the trial, the defence made an allegation
    of recent fabrication, said to arise from the breakdown of the appellant’s
    marriage to S.M. As noted above, S.M. was highly critical of the appellant in
    her testimony. However, the marriage did not come to an end until 2016, much
    later than the complainant’s initial disclosures. The Crown relied upon the
    complainant’s prior statements to her mother and sister to neutralize the recent
    fabrication allegation. The threatening incident was also capable of playing
    the same role given that the incident was instigated by the father’s knowledge
    of the complaint made by his daughter against the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge acknowledged the Crown’s
    position at para. 74: “The Crown submitted that the assertion that this was a recent
    fabrication is rebutted by the fact that the complainant disclosed sexual abuse
    by the accused in 1995 and earlier.” The trial judge referenced this body of
    evidence again in that part of the judgment reproduced in para. 28, above. However,
    she made no further mention of recent fabrication; her language reflects a more
    extensive use of this evidence. For convenience, I reproduce the critical
    aspects of this passage again:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Her disclosure to her mother and sister is
    consistent with their testimony and their description of her demeanour of fear,
    tension, and tears. Her mother also describes the reaction of the complainant's
    biological father in threatening the accused in a similar manner to the
    complainant's description.&nbsp;<u>That threat lends support to what was
    happening in the family at the time</u>. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[The complainant’s] testimony of the sexual
    touching from ages 7 to 14 was clear and convincing and not contradicted in any
    material way. <u>I find that the early disclosure to her mother, and
    particularly her sister, provides the reliability necessary to support her
    testimony</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a preliminary matter, I note that reference
    to the complainant’s evidence of disclosure being “consistent with their
    testimony and their description of her demeanour of fear, tension, and tears”
    is not entirely accurate. As discussed above, there were differing accounts of
    how the allegations came to light, especially in the evidence of S.M.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> Moreover, the trial judge’s
    reference to the complainant’s evidence as “clear and convincing and not
    contradicted in any material way” overstates the cogency of her evidence.
    Earlier in her reasons, the trial judge identified a number of inconsistencies
    in her evidence, both internal and external, related to this time period.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept the appellant’s submission that the
    trial judge’s reference to the threat made by complainant’s father was
    problematic. The respondent submits that the trial judge’s finding – “[The
    biological father’s] threat [to the appellant] lends support to what was
    happening in the family at the time” – was a reference to the complainant
    having disclosed the abuse, and nothing more. Had this been the case, this
    would have been a legitimate use of this evidence: see </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Stirling</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2008 SCC 10, [2008] 1
    S.C.R. 272, at paras. 5-7. But the trial judge went further. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was important that the evidence of this
    incident be carefully contained. The evidence was unclear on the issue of who told
    the complainant’s father about the allegations, but the information surely
    originated with the complainant. In view of his reaction, it is clear that her
    father believed the allegations. The trial judge failed to restrict the use of
    this evidence to the sole basis upon which it was admissible – to neutralize
    the recent fabrication allegation. Finding that the “threat lends support to
    what was happening in the family at the time” indicates a more substantive use,
    not one restricted to the mere fact that it was reported at a particular point
    in time. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This type of reasoning is even more apparent in
    the trial judge’s use of the complainant’s statements to her mother and sister,
    which she said “provides the reliability necessary to support her testimony”.
    This statement extends beyond recent fabrication. The trial judge improperly
    used this evidence to enhance the complainant’s general trustworthiness: </span><em><span

    S.C.C.A. No. 139, Hourigan J.A. explained, at para. 41: “[prior consistent
    statements] cannot be used for the prohibited inference that consistency enhances
    credibility, or the incorrect conclusion that the simple making of a prior
    consistent statement corroborates in-court testimony”; see also </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. D.C</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA>.</span></i><span

    prior statements and the threatening incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent argues that this evidence was admissible
    under the narrative as circumstantial evidence exception, “not to corroborate
    the evidence of the witness, but to provide the surrounding circumstances and
    context to evaluate the credibility and reliability of the witness’s in-court
    testimony”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Khan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at

    O.J. No. 2245, at paras. 20-22. This was not the basis of admissibility
    advanced by the Crown at trial; nor is there any indication in the trial
    judge’s reasons that she used the evidence for this limited purpose. The trial
    judge gave no explanation of how this evidence “provides the reliability
    necessary to support her testimony” or how “it lends support to what was
    happening in the family at the time”.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the allegation of recent fabrication
    was a challenge to the complainant’s credibility or sincerity (i.e., that she
    made-up the allegations). It had nothing to do with the complainant’s
    reliability. As the trial judge said in the passage reproduced at para. 26,
    above: “The issue becomes less one of credibility than one of reliability.”
    Neither the threatening incident nor the complainant’s statements to her mother
    and sister were capable of providing the “support” that the trial judge
    attributed to this evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In summary, looking at the trial judge’s reasons
    as a whole, this evidence was used improperly to enhance the complainant’s general
    trustworthiness as a witness through her repetition of the allegations on prior
    occasions: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Stirling</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,

lang=EN-CA>, the Supreme Court disagreed with the majority holding in the court
    of appeal that the trial judge’s misuse of the prior consistent statements
    occasioned no prejudice. Writing for the Court, Charron J. said, at para. 40: “The
    trial judge relied heavily on the corroborative value of the complainant's
    prior statements in convicting Mr. Dinardo.&nbsp;He was clearly of the view
    that the complainant's consistency in recounting the allegations made her story
    more credible.” </span></p>

    reasoning in this case in her use of the threatening incident and the
    complainant’s statements to her mother and sister. Her references to this
    evidence appeared in a critical part of her judgment where she explained why
    the complainant’s evidence was sufficiently reliable in relation to the earlier
    allegations, even though it had not been on the later allegations. It was
    determinative of the appellant’s guilt.</span></p>
