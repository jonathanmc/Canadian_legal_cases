  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Part I: Introduction</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Certainty in the resolution of financial issues
    flowing from the dissolution of family relationships has been a policy
    imperative underlying much of the recent reform of family law in Canada. Child
    support, spousal support, and the division of family property have all been clarified
    through legislative and regulatory reform. While certainty should be tempered
    by limited judicial discretion to ensure fairness, certainty facilitates two
    essential policy objectives of family law: the encouragement of settlement and
    the avoidance of costly litigation to resolve financial issues.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Government of Ontario enacted legislation that
    came into effect in 2012 amending the <em>Pension Benefits Act</em>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.8 (the “<em>PBA</em>”) and the <em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. F.3 (the “<em>FLA</em>”), to simplify the valuation of pensions for purposes
    of calculating net family property. This legislation brought much-needed
    certainty to the valuation of what, in many cases, is the most significant
    asset held by litigants on their valuation date. A formula was established for
    pension valuations and the responsibility for calculating that value was
    imposed on pension administrators. Thus, courts largely got out of the business
    of pension valuation. For litigants this provided both certainty and fairness.
    It also allowed them to avoid the costly process of retaining actuarial experts
    and litigating competing pension valuations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Ontario rules for valuating provincially
    regulated pensions for equalization purposes are relatively clear and easily
    applied. However, the valuation of federally regulated pensions is not as
    certain. Parliament has not reformed the law regarding pension valuations to
    bring it in line with the Ontario legislation. Until it does, Ontario courts must
    apply, to the extent reasonably possible, the provincial approach to valuing federal
    pensions for family law equalization.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the present case, the most significant issue
    at trial was the valuation of the parties’ federally regulated pensions for
    equalization purposes. Three </span><span lang=EN-CA>aspects of the trial
    judge’s reasons on this issue are challenged on appeal: (i) the determination
    of the parties’ normal retirement dates; (ii) the decision not to include in
    the respondent’s net family property the contingent interest she held in the
    appellant’s pension; and (iii) the inclusion of a contingent survivor benefit
    in valuating the parties’ pensions. While the trial judge reached the right conclusions
    on the survivor benefit and contingent survivor benefit issues, she erred in
    her approach to all three issues by failing to </span><span style='color:black'>heed
    the requirement of s. 10.1(2) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>FLA</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'> </span><span style='color:black'>that, in
    valuating pensions that are not provincially regulated, the Ontario method of
    valuation should be applied, with only necessary modifications.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the correct approach to pension
    valuation issues such as those on appeal is for parties to obtain valuations
    from their pension administrator where possible. Where this is not possible or
    issues remain as to the proper application of the Ontario regime to a federal
    pension plan, the parties should refer such issues to a trial judge for
    determination, usually with the aid of a jointly appointed expert. However in
    this case, given what has transpired, I would suggest, as will be explained
    below, a different process to resolve these issues. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to the pension valuation issues, the
    appellant also appeals certain date of marriage deductions and notional
    disposition costs used by the trial judge in calculating net family property. Further,
    he seeks an order permitting him to pay part of his equalization payment by
    means of the transfer of a lump sum from his pension. I would dismiss these
    grounds of appeal, as they are meritless. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Part II: Background Facts</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and respondent were married in
    October 1995 and separated in September 2016. Both spouses worked for entities
    governed by the federal <em>Public Service Superannuation Act</em>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. P-36 (the “<em>PSSA</em>”). The appellant became a pension member on
    December 4, 1984, and retired on December 17, 2016. The respondent started working
    for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2008 and continues to be employed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent commenced an application in the
    Superior Court in May 2017 seeking orders for spousal support, child support
    and custody, along with the equalization of net family property. In August
    2017, the appellant filed his answer. In September 2018, the respondent amended
    her application to include a claim for divorce. The appellant was alerted to
    the respondent’s intention to divorce at least as early as November 2017. The
    parties were able to resolve all issues except equalization, which proceeded to
    trial. The calculation of net family property was based on a series of findings
    made by the trial judge that are challenged on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The most significant component of the net family
    property calculation was the values of the parties’ pensions. According to s.
    10.1(1) of the <em>FLA</em>, the imputed value for family law purposes of a
    spouse’s interest in a pension plan is determined in accordance with s. 67.2 of
    the <em>PBA</em>.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If, as here, the pension plan is a plan to which
    the <em>PBA</em> does not apply, s.&nbsp;10.1(2) of the <em>FLA</em><i> </i>nevertheless
    requires the <em>PBA</em> approach be used, “with necessary modifications”. One
    element of the valuation calculation under the <em>PBA</em> is the normal
    retirement date under the plan. Provincially regulated plans are required to
    provide a normal retirement date, which permits a straightforward valuation
    calculation. The <em>PSSA</em> does not list a normal retirement date. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both parties tendered reports by experts
    valuating their respective pension plans. The respondent’s expert used 65 as
    her normal retirement date because, although retirement with an unreduced
    pension is possible at 60, a “fair amount” of civil servants work past 60. The
    appellant’s expert calculated the value using ages 60 and 65. He used 60
    because this is when all members who joined prior to 2013 are entitled to
    unreduced benefits. The appellant’s expert opined that 65 was also reasonable for
    several reasons, including because it was not unusual for members to retire
    after 60 and the majority of pension plans in Canada define the normal
    retirement age as 65.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded that the normal
    retirement date for the appellant was age 60 and for the respondent age 65.
    These conclusions were based on the pre-separation evidence of the parties’
    intended retirement dates. In approaching the issue this way, the trial judge
    relied on the method for determining the likely retirement date from <em>Di
    Francesco v. Di Francesco</em>, 2011 ONSC 3844, at para. 31. The trial judge
    found that the respondent continues to work and intends to do so until age 65.
    The appellant, meanwhile, planned to retire when he was entitled to an
    unreduced pension. There was evidence that he remained in his job slightly
    longer than that in order to settle a grievance with his employer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When she calculated net family property, the
    trial judge excluded the respondent’s survivor benefits under the appellant’s
    pension, because the respondent would lose her entitlement to those benefits at
    the time of divorce. The value of the appellant’s survivor benefit was not
    provided and was not included in his net family property. Contingent survivor
    benefits were included in the net family property calculation, over the
    appellant’s objection. The trial judge also made several findings on the
    appellant’s date of marriage deductions and the parties’ notional disposition
    costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, the trial judge calculated net
    family property of $1,834,578 for the appellant and $707,458 for the
    respondent. Accordingly, she ordered that the appellant must pay the respondent
    $563,560 to equalize their net family properties. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Part III: Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are five main issues on this appeal: (i)
    the appellant’s motion to tender fresh evidence; (ii) objections to the pension
    valuations; (iii) objections to the </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:

    costs used by the trial judge in calculating net family property; and (v) a

    modifications” in s. 10.1(2) of the <em>FLA</em> indicates a legislative intent
    that the substance of s. 67.2 of the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>be applied, while
    recognizing that some details may require modification. As the Supreme Court of
    Canada has recently observed, the words “with necessary modifications” are a
    contemporary reformulation of the Latin phrase <em>mutatis mutandis</em>: see <em>R.
    v. Penunsi</em>, 2019 SCC 39, 378 C.C.C. (3d) 37, at para. 49. They mean that
    the rules to be applied are read with necessary changes in points of detail,
    while the matter remains the same: <em>Penunsi</em>, at para. 50.</span></p>

    the <em>FLA</em>, Raikes J. held that any departure from the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>methodology
    must be justified as necessary by the party seeking that departure: <em>Kelly
    v. Kelly</em>, 2017 ONSC 7609, at paras. 161-162. I agree with and adopt that
    statement. This approach is consistent with the language of necessary
    modification. If one of the parties can show that, because the plan is not
    regulated under the <em>PBA</em>, a modification to the approach is necessary,
    departure will be warranted. Otherwise, the default position is that the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>approach is to be used.</span></p>

    legislative intent in reforming pension valuation on marital breakdown. The
    purpose of the new legislation was to create a uniform approach that would
    create certainty and avoid costly litigation over pension valuations: see Ontario,

    clear intention in s. 10.1(2) of the <em>FLA</em> that a non-Ontario pension be
    valuated wherever possible in the same manner as an Ontario regulated pension.
    This means that the valuation formula in the <em>PBA</em> regulation <em>Family
    Law Matters</em> O. Reg. 287/11 should be applied to a non-Ontario pension with
    modifications only where necessary. In addition, a purposive interpretation of
    s. 10.1(2) of the <em>FLA</em><i> </i>requires that, to the extent that other
    Ontario statutory provisions or regulatory requirements impact the valuation of
    a pension for family law purposes, they too should be applied to the valuation
    of a non-Ontario pension. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In other words, a pension administrator should,
    to the extent possible, valuate a non-Ontario pension as if it were an Ontario
    pension. This is consistent with the purpose of the valuation exercise, which
    is to obtain a fair, predictable, and consistent division of net family
    property. Thus, it is important that provincial and federal pensions be
    valuated in the same manner, to the extent reasonably possible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The problem with the trial judge’s analysis of
    the parties’ pensions is that she did not default to the requirement that a
    federally regulated pension should be valuated in the same manner as a provincially
    regulated pension unless a departure from the methodology was necessary in the
    circumstances. Instead, she applied the pre-legislative-reform approach of
    tailoring the pension valuation to the parties’ specific circumstances. I turn
    now to consider the specific objections to the trial judge’s valuation of the
    parties’ pensions. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial judge err in determining the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted, the term “normal retirement date” is
    one of the variables included in the pension valuation methodology prescribed
    under the <em>PBA</em>. In this case, in order to calculate the value of the
    parties’ pensions in accordance with this methodology, the parties’ actuaries
    had to fix a value for this variable. Fixing a value for the normal retirement
    date for the plan at issue requires a modification. This is because “normal
    retirement date” is a defined term in the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>meaning “the date
    or age specified in the pension plan as the normal retirement date of members”:
    see s. 1(1). Plans regulated by the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>must specify a normal
    retirement date: s. 10(1)4. However, the plan at issue is not regulated by the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>and therefore is not required to, and does not, specify a normal retirement
    date. The definition is therefore not helpful and must be modified when
    applying the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>rules to valuate these pensions for family law
    purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The question is what modification is necessary.
    As discussed above, the legislature signaled a desire, in prescribing the <em>PBA</em><i> </i>methodology with necessary modifications, that the substance of this
    methodology be followed, even though the details of a federally regulated plan
    may not map perfectly onto provincially regulated plans. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the absence of a fixed value referenced in
    the definition, the meaning of the term normal retirement date can nonetheless
    be determined by reference to how it is used in the provincial scheme. An
    analysis of its use in the <em>PBA</em> and other regulated pension plans shows
    that the normal retirement date is not a case-specific value reflecting when a
    given member is likely to retire. Rather, it is a generalized value
    representing the date at which the pension plan entitles any given member to
    unreduced pension benefits.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After reaching the normal retirement date,
    working members become entitled on terminating employment to the benefits to
    which they are entitled under their plan: <em>PBA</em>, s. 35(3). The <em>PBA</em><i> </i>requires that this date be no later than one year after the member turns
    65: s. 35(1). However, members do not necessarily all retire at the normal
    retirement date. The <em>PBA</em><i> </i>foresees that members may work past
    the normal retirement date and potentially earn additional pension benefits,
    but these additional amounts can be capped by the terms of the plan: <em>PBA</em>,
    s. 35(3).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This analysis is confirmed by the terms of
    various major pension plans. Across pension plans, members’ normal retirement
    date is the date at which any member is entitled to retire with unreduced
    pension benefits: see OMERS Primary Pension Plan, s. 16; University of Toronto
    Pension Plan, s. 6.01; Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan, ss. 6.1, 6.2; OPSEU

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is consistent with guidance from the
    Financial Services Commission of Ontario (‘FSCO”), the agency responsible for
    the regulation of Ontario pensions. In their policy, <em>Retirement Dates</em>,
    R700-101<i>, </i>they define the normal retirement date this way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As a minimum standard under the PBA the normal
    retirement date is the date or age specified in the pension plan as the normal
    retirement date of members. The PBA requires every plan to specify a normal
    retirement date. Section 10(1) of the PBA specifies the documents that create
    and support a pension plan shall set out the normal retirement date under the
    plan. Section 35(1) requires this date be no later than one year after the
    member reaches age 65. <u>A member has the right to retire and begin receiving
    an unreduced pension at the normal</u> <u>retirement date, if the member so
    chooses.</u> The PBA does not require a pension plan member to cease employment
    and begin receiving a pension at the normal retirement date or age. A former
    member or other person who is entitled to a deferred pension is also eligible
    to begin receiving an unreduced pension at the normal retirement date.

    administrator, who is not regulated by the provincial legislation, refuses to

    that a single jointly-appointed<span class=apple-converted-space><span

    orders. The joint expert can set out for the court the relevant decisions that
    need to be made in order to apply Ontario law to a federal pension, as well as potentially
    necessary modifications. It would then be for the court to determine whether

    the divorce was granted. The correct approach was to treat this issue the same
    way it would be treated if this were an Ontario pension by first asking: What

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Ontario Pension Benefits Act and

    the former spouse if the separation occurs after retirement. This is logical for
    Ontario regulated pension plans since a spouse who is separated from the member
    prior to retirement will not be entitled to a survivor pension on the member's
    retirement. However, this does not necessarily reflect the survivor pension
    entitlements in the case of pension plans from other jurisdictions, such as the
    PSSA, where a separated married spouse is entitled to the survivor pension if
    the marriage commenced prior to retirement and the member and spouse are not
    divorced at death.</span></p>

    of the survivor benefit, and exclusion of the contingent survivor benefit, would
    be modifications of the usual approach but they might be necessary:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. What necessary modifications did you have

    that this might be necessary because, unlike with an Ontario pension, the respondent
    remained technically entitled to the survivor benefit post-separation until the
    parties divorced. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not see modification of the usual approach
    to include this benefit as necessary on the facts of this case. The expectation
    is that the Ontario regime will be applied where reasonably possible, unless
    there are compelling reasons not to. In these circumstances, where entitlement
    to the survivor benefit terminates upon divorce, and the respondent sought a
    divorce early on in proceedings, and the appellant consented to the granting of
    a divorce, there is no compelling reason to depart from the requirements of the
    standard rules to include the full value of an asset never to be realized in
    the hands of the respondent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the forgoing, I would dismiss this
    ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial judge err in including a
    contingent survivor benefit in the appellant’s net family property?</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in including a contingent survivor benefit in valuating his pension. A
    contingent survivor benefit is payable to a pension member’s future potential
    spouse. Some value for a contingent survivor benefit is included in the value
    of a pension based on the probability of the member having an eligible spouse
    at death and based on the age of the spouse. The appellant took the position
    that this figure should not be included in the value of his pension, whereas
    the respondent’s expert included the figure in her pension valuation. The trial
    judge included these figures in calculating the value of both parties’
    pensions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Again, the trial judge reached the correct
    result on this issue but erred in her analytical approach. As with the other
    pension issues, the correct approach was to determine what the law would
    require if this were an Ontario pension and then determine whether any
    modifications of that approach are necessary in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s expert stated that the <em>Standards
    of Practice of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries</em> require actuaries to
    include contingent survivor benefits in the commuted value of a member’s
    pension benefits on termination. He further stated that the FSCO has instructed
    pension plan administrators “to include the value of contingent survivor
    benefits in the family law value in the same way the pension plan includes this
    value when determining the commuted value for terminated pension plan members.”
    He described the inclusion of this benefit in the appellant’s net family
    property as “in accordance with the regulations and the generally accepted
    methodology for calculating Ontario family law values.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s expert opined that,
    notwithstanding the foregoing, including the survivor pension payable to a
    possible future spouse was unfair because the member may not have an eligible
    spouse, and even if the member does have an eligible spouse, the survivor
    pension would be an asset of the future spouse, not an asset of the member.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to even the appellant’s expert, if this
    were an Ontario pension the pension administrator would have been obliged to
    follow the FSCO direction and include these figures. In the testimony quoted
    above, the appellant’s expert acknowledged that exclusion of the contingent
    survivor benefit would represent a modification of the standard methodology.
    Again, I see no compelling reason why the usual valuation approach should be
    modified for the parties’ federal pensions. The ability to confer a survivor
    benefit on a future partner is of value to a pension member even if the member
    does not receive these funds personally. In any event, no changes are necessary
    for the court to apply the usual provincial approach to these federal pensions.
    The appellant’s retirement was a post-separation event, and such events
    generally will not affect the valuation of assets on valuation day according to
    the standard methodology. I would, therefore, dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue here is the treatment of interest in
    the appellant’s net family property statement. In his date of marriage
    property, he included prorated figures for interest earned on his Scotiabank Guaranteed
    Investment Certificate, Canada Savings Bonds, and Bank of Nova Scotia RRSP. The
    trial judge found that it was permissible for the appellant to include the
    interest earned on his pre-marriage assets. However, in order to include this
    interest as property owned on the date of marriage, she found that the
    appellant was obliged to include interest for the property he owned on the date
    of separation. The trial judge found that he did not undertake this exercise
    for these date of separation assets and stated that the appellant “cannot
    benefit by including interest in his calculations when it is advantageous to
    him and not including it when it is not.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in fact in finding that he did not include interest in his date of separation
    assets. I am not persuaded by this argument. The appellant’s net family
    property statements suggest that he did not include interest in his date of
    separation assets. For example, in his December 10, 2018 statement, his
    Scotiabank Guaranteed Investment Certificate is assigned a value of $85,000 as
    of the valuation date and the same figure is used for the current value. This
    strongly suggests that interest was not included, as there is no increase in
    the value between the two dates. The onus is on the appellant to show that the
    trial judge’s factual findings should be overturned. This would require
    evidence of the inclusion of interest in his date of separation values, and the
    methodology used to reach such figures, sufficient to displace the trial
    judge’s findings against him on this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having found as a fact that the appellant did
    not include interest in these date of separation asset values, I see no legal
    error in the trial judge’s decision to disregard the date of marriage interest
    values for the sake of consistency. I would, therefore, dismiss this ground of
    appeal. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am not persuaded that there is a basis to
    interfere with the trial judge’s calculation of notional disposition costs. The
    appellant failed to meet his onus of adducing sufficient evidence to establish
    these costs. For example, the appellant led no evidence regarding the
    appropriate tax rate to apply to his date of marriage severance pay, and the
    only information the court had with regard to the appellant’s marginal tax rate
    as at the date of separation was the agreement of the parties that the tax rate
    on the retroactive pay he received should be 45%. Moreover, the 25.8% rate used
    was the same one used by the appellant’s actuary assuming a retirement age of
    60. In addition, the 18% rate was the same rate the appellant used in his Net
    Family Property Statement dated December 10, 2018, and he did not challenge
    this rate at trial. Deference is owed to the trial judge’s assessment of the
    evidence relating to costs of disposition: see <em>Berta v. Berta</em>, 2015
    ONCA 918, 128 O.R. (3d) 730, at para. 82.</span></p>

    should have permitted him to satisfy part of his equalization payment by
    transfer of a lump sum out of his pension plan. He submits that the requirement
    to make such a large equalization payment means that he will have to arrange
    financing to satisfy the equalization payment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this submission. The
    appellant stated explicitly in his amended answer, in the context of his
    argument that the respondent should have his survivor pension added to her net
    family property, that he would not apply for division of his pension under the <em>Pension
    Benefits Division Act</em>, S.C. 1992, c. 46, Sch. II, as this would terminate
    her entitlement to the survivor benefit. Thus, he made a strategic decision not
    to seek an order for a lump sum transfer. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the evidence at trial established
