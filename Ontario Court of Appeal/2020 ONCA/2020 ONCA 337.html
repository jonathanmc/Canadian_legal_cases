lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The proposed class action arises out of the
    dramatic collapse of a proprietary derivatives-based exchange-traded fund (“the
    Fund”) created and managed by the respondent, Horizons ETFS Management (Canada)
    Inc. (“Horizons”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Fund was meant to provide inverse exposure
    to stock market volatility. The Fund was described in the prospectus as “highly
    speculative” and “involv[ing] a high degree of risk”. Units in the Fund were
    offered to retail investors, as well as registered brokers and dealers who
    bought and sold them over stock exchanges.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After two years of growth, the value of the Fund
    dropped suddenly and dramatically: on February 5, 2018, the Fund lost almost
    90% of its value overnight. Investors lost nearly $40 million and the Fund
    never recovered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In April 2018, Horizons announced that it was
    closing the Fund because it “no longer offer[ed] an acceptable risk/reward
    trade-off for investors”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Graham Wright brought a claim pursuant to the <em>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c. 6, as the representative plaintiff
    for all persons who owned units of the Fund at the close of the Toronto Stock
    Exchange on February 5, 2018 (“the Class”). He alleged that Horizons was
    negligent and was liable for making misrepresentations in its prospectus under s.
    130 of the <em>Securities Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The certification judge held that the statement
    of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action, because it was plain
    and obvious that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Horizons owed the Class no duty of care and that
    there was therefore no cause of action in negligence; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Wright and the Class did not have a cause of
    action pursuant to s. 130 of the <em>Securities Act</em>, as the Fund was
    offered over stock exchanges and not directly to investors. They could and
    should have proceeded under s. 138.3 of the <em>Securities Act,</em> not under
    s. 130.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Wright submits the certification judge erred
    in both holdings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, Mr. Wright submits that the statement of
    claim discloses a cause of action in negligence. In particular, he claims
    Horizons was negligent in designing, developing, offering, and promoting a
    financial product that was not adequately tested before launching, excessively
    risky, complex and doomed to fail. He also alleges that Horizons failed to
    explain the nature and extent of the risks of investing in the Fund, monitor
    the Fund’s investment strategy, or diligently perform its duties as manager of
    the Fund. When the Fund inevitably failed, Horizons failed to take action to
    prevent investors from sustaining massive losses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Mr. Wright maintains Horizons made
    misrepresentations in its prospectus within the meaning of s. 130 of the <em>Securities
    Act</em>. Mr. Wright claims that the prospectus failed to disclose the real
    risks attached to the Fund, including the disparity in the way gains and losses
    are experienced, and that it was inevitable that the Fund would lose all or
    substantially all of its value in a single day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Horizons argues that the certification judge
    correctly concluded that Horizons, as the creator of the Fund, had no duty to
    protect investors from a high-risk investment product or from possible losses.
    The prospectus clearly indicates that these were “high risk” investments and
    that large sums could be lost in short order. Even if there were such a duty,
    there are sound policy reasons for not allowing such claims where the parties
    are best left to allocate risks through alternative means.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Horizons claims Mr. Wright has no right
    of action for misrepresentation under s. 130 of the <em>Securities Act</em>.
    Horizons argues that a remedy under s. 130 is not available for
    misrepresentations associated with purchases on the <em>secondary</em> market
    (the stock exchange) and is only available for purchases on the <em>primar</em>y
    market. Instead the claim should have been brought pursuant to s. 138.3 of the <em>Securities
    Act</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The only issue on these appeals is whether the
    certification judge erred in concluding that the pleading discloses no cause of
    action as required by s. 5(1)(a) of the <em>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</em> and the action should therefore be dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal, set aside the order of the certification judge dismissing the motion
    for certification and the action, allow the claim to be amended such that a
    claim can proceed under s. 130 of the <em>Securities Act,</em> and remit the
    matter to the certification judge to determine whether the remaining criteria
    for certification are met.</span></p>

    Dow Jones Indices LLC and licensed to Horizons in order to provide exposure to

    Futures Index declined by a certain percentage on a given day, the Fund’s net
    asset value automatically went up by that percentage. Conversely, when the VIX

    that percentage.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Fund was to pursue daily investment results
    that attempted to correspond to the inverse of the daily performance of the VIX
    Futures Index. It did so by shorting (selling) “longer term” VIX futures
    contracts and covering the short position by purchasing “nearer term” VIX
    futures contracts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If volatility remained low, the Fund’s strategy
    generated income by selling longer term VIX futures contracts at a premium in
    relation to nearer term contracts, since market conditions became easier to
    predict as the contract date drew closer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, where market volatility increased, the
    price to repurchase a VIX futures contract could increase quickly (to a
    theoretically unlimited level). The cost of rebalancing at the end of each
    trading day could erase any gains accrued over months or years, in a single
    day.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Investor anxiety caused the VIX Index to spike
    significantly in percentage terms, since it had been sitting at historically
    low levels. The Fund suffered a corresponding loss of 81.42% of its value from
    February 5 to February 6, 2018. Investors who held units in the Fund during

    bought Fund units that afternoon significantly overpaid for units that were
    going to be marked down in value after the close of the market once the Fund

    from the net asset value struck by Horizons at 4:00 p.m. Sophisticated market

lang=EN-CA>There is arguably, therefore, a relationship of proximity between
    Horizons and the Class. Horizons undertook to create and sell a Fund that was
    suitable for some investors and, on the pleading as drafted, it was not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Read generously, the pleading provides that investors were not given
    sufficient information about the nature and extent of the risks and possible
    rewards to enable them to make an informed decision as to whether to invest,
    nor were they told that there was a design flaw and that the investment was
    doomed to fail. Without this information, the undertaking to provide a risky
    but viable investment was not met, and the risk of injury flowing from

lang=EN-CA>Where there is no recognized duty, the first step is to determine
    whether there is a proximate relationship between the parties resulting from
    the defendant’s undertaking that invites the plaintiff’s reasonable reliance.
    If so, the defendant becomes obligated to take reasonable care: <em>Livent</em>,<em> </em>at para. 30. The proximity analysis includes an examination of “‘expectations,
    representations, reliance, and the property or other interests involved’ as
    well as any statutory obligations”: <em>Livent</em>, at para. 29 (citations
    omitted).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In this case, the certification judge correctly determined that
    there is a legally proximate relationship between the Class of ETF investors
    and Horizons as ETF fund developer and manager, and that the critical issue is
    the scope of the undertaking assumed by the fund developer and manager.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>However, the certification judge held that “Horizons’ [only]
    undertaking was to place on the exchange a financial product that operated in
    accordance with the accompanying disclosure documents.” In response to Mr.
    Wright’s claim that Horizons breached a duty of care not to develop and market
    an ETF that was too risky for the retail investment market, the certification
    judge held that Horizons “did not undertake responsibility for any gains or
    losses purchasers might realize in purchasing the units.” He concluded that
    “Horizons cannot be liable for a risk of injury against which it did not
    undertake to protect.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I disagree. In my view, Horizons’ undertaking was broader than the undertaking
    that the certification judge described.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    honestly, in good faith and in the best interests of the investment fund and
    exercise the degree of care and diligence that a prudent person would exercise
    in the circumstances as provided for in s. 116 of the <em>Securities Act.</em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Assuming the allegations in the pleading are proven, Horizons
    created a Fund that was not suitable for <em>any</em> investors because the
    design flaw rendered it doomed to fail. Moreover, Horizons failed to disclose
    key features of the Fund’s design and trading strategy so that investors would
    know the real risks before investing. The Fund managers arguably failed to meet
    their undertaking to investors and the risk of injury was reasonably
    foreseeable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The failure to provide full disclosure of the risks and/or the fact
    that the product was doomed to fail and the Fund manager’s failure to develop a
    viable strategy for the Fund might constitute a breach of a <em>prima facie</em> duty of care and/or a breach of the fund managers’ statutory duties as set out
    in s. 116 of the <em>Securities Act</em>: <em>Growthworks WV Management Ltd. v.
    Growthworks Canadian Fund Ltd</em></span><span lang=EN-CA>., 2018 ONSC 3108, at

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is not plain and obvious that policy considerations should negate
    the alleged <em>prima facie</em> duty of care. The risk of loss cannot be
    addressed by contract because this was not a vendor-purchaser relationship.
    Nor, on the claim as pleaded, can it be addressed by insurance, or due
    diligence by Class members. Moreover, it does not seem apparent that imposing a
    duty would create liability toward an indeterminate number of persons. Allowing
    the claim might cause fund managers like Horizons to exercise caution and
    control in designing investment products and ensure that all material facts are
    provided to investors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I also note that on a certification motion, as on a motion to
    strike, the certification judge is not to assess whether the claim can
    withstand summary judgment or a trial on the basis of the material adduced on
    the motion, but only whether the pleadings contain some radical defect such
    that there is no reasonable prospect of success: <em>Hunt</em>, at p. 980. The
    courts must “err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to
    proceed to trial”:<em> Imperial Tobacco</em>, at para. 21. A full evidentiary
    record that includes information about how the Fund was structured, the risks
    associated with investing in the Fund, the responsibilities of the Fund manager
    and other evidence may assist in determining the merits of the claim. As
    pleaded, it is not clear that the claim cannot succeed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I would not agree that the negligence claim
    should be struck as having no reasonable prospect of success. The certification

    (which provides a statutory cause of action for misrepresentations in a

    are primary market sales. However, he noted that all other Fund units are
    connected to the secondary market and that Creation Units are comingled with
    those other units. As a result, an ETF purchaser cannot know whether his or her
    purchase involves a primary sale of a Creation Unit or a resale in the
    secondary market. He therefore held that “[p]ractically speaking”, trading in
    ETFs is a secondary market phenomenon because units are made available for sale
    over an exchange, the purchase price is paid to the unitholder not the issuer,

    security not previously issued, not a trade by or on behalf of an issuer in
    previously issued securities of that issuer that have been redeemed or
    purchased or donated to that issuer, not a trade in previously issued
    securities of that issuer from the holdings of any control person, and not a

lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

lang=EN-CA>Retail investors can only buy or sell ETF units through registered
    brokers and dealers, who buy or sell them over the stock exchanges on which the
    units are listed. These units come from other holders or from the inventory of
    ETF units held by a designated broker or dealer. A designated broker or dealer
    will issue a unit from its inventory of units, if any, or they will make a
    subscription order to the ETF manager, who will create a brand-new unit, a
    “Creation Unit”.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>An investor who purchases an ETF unit over an exchange does not know
    when purchasing a unit whether he or she is receiving a Creation Unit or an ETF
    unit that has been in circulation previously on a stock exchange (in the
    secondary market). It is not clear from the certification judge’s findings
    whether Horizons or anyone else is able to determine whether a particular unit
    is a Creation Unit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As described by the certification judge, ETFs are regulated on the
    understanding that the sale of a Creation Unit is a distribution within the
    meaning of s. 1(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Securities Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Canadian regulators take the position that the
    first sale of a Creation Unit of an ETF constitutes a distribution of the unit
    under the securities statutes and National Instrument 41-101 and, therefore,
    the Designated Broker and the Dealers are subject to the prospectus delivery
    requirements set out in that legislation.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>However, because Creation Units are generally
    comingled with other ETF units purchased by the Designated Broker and the
    Dealers in the secondary market it is not practicable for the Designated Broker
    or the Dealers to determine whether a particular re-sale of ETF units involved
    Creation Units, ETF units purchased in the secondary market, or both.
    Therefore, the securities regulator grants the Designated Broker and the
    Dealers an exemption from the obligation to deliver a prospectus with each
    re-sale of a Creation Unit. Instead, the Designated Broker and Dealers are
    required to provide a summary document to an investor purchasing units in a particular
    ETF for the first time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This position was reflected in the 2014 amendments to the <em>Securities
    Act.</em> Sections 71(1) to (1.3) recognize that the sale of Creation Units
    constitutes a “distribution” that would otherwise require dealers to deliver a
    prospectus to purchasers under s. 53(1) but exempt them from having to do so.
    Dealers are instead permitted to provide investors with a summary document
    called an ETF facts document: <em>Securities Act, </em>ss. 71(1.1)-(1.3);

lang=EN-CA>The allegation in the statement of claim is that the Units were
    distributed by a prospectus that contained misrepresentations. Moreover, since
    the Fund was continuously distributed, each Class member qualifies as a
    “purchaser who purchases a security offered by the prospectus during the period
    of distribution or during distribution to the public” within the meaning of s.
    130 of the <em>Securities Act</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The parties and the certification judge agreed that there is a
    statutory cause of action for misrepresentation in an ETF prospectus. The only
    question is whether the Class may proceed by way of a claim pursuant to s. 130
    or whether the Class must proceed by way of s. 138.3.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I disagree with the certification
    judge’s conclusion that all units held by the Class should be treated as
    secondary market purchases such that only s. 138.3 applies. I agree with the
    appellant that the certification judge erred in his analysis of the
    requirements of s. 130 but would require that the representative plaintiff
    amend the statement of claim to plead the necessary material facts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, Creation Units are considered by the <em>Securities Act</em> to be primary market units and owners of those units should be entitled to
    invoke their rights thereunder. Disclosure documents for Creation Units are
    incorporated by reference into the prospectus and investors who purchased those
    Units qualify as purchasers of a security offered by the prospectus during the
    period of distribution or during distribution to the public within the meaning
    of s. 130 of the <em>Securities Act</em>. Moreover, a resale of a Creation Unit
    by a designated broker or dealer to an investor qualifies as a “distribution”
    under the <em>Securities Act</em>, because “distribution” includes a purchase
    and sale of a security that has not been previously issued “in the course of or
    incidental to a distribution”: <em>Securities Act</em>, s. 1(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, denying holders of Creation Units the right to proceed
    pursuant to s. 130 would deny them the advantages of proceeding by way of s.
    130 and would require the Class to seek leave of the court to proceed with a
    claim under s. 138.3 when holders of Creation Units are eligible to proceed
    under s. 130 where no leave is required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Third, the fact that Creation Units are comingled with other ETF
    Units purchased by the designated broker and dealers in the secondary market
    should not disentitle holders of Creation Units from invoking their rights
    under s. 130 of the <em>Securities Act</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Class was not responsible for the way funds are distributed and
    had no control over what kind of unit they were receiving. At this stage in the
    proceeding, Class members do not know, through no fault of their own, whether a
    purchase involved a primary or secondary market sale. This should not be a
    reason for denying them the right to seek the relief to which they are
    entitled. It is not clear from the certification judge’s findings whether
    Horizons or anyone else can distinguish between sales of Creation Units and
    other units. This issue will be canvassed in the course of the litigation
    including the determination of the best means of addressing this issue, taking
    into account that some members hold Creation Units and others do not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Fourth, permitting Mr. Wright to plead a cause of action under s.
    130 does not unduly expand the scope of who may recover under that section. At
    this stage, it is unclear which or how many Class members purchased Creation
    Units. However, the statutory cause of action under s. 130 ultimately will not
    apply to Class members who purchased Fund units that had previously circulated
    on the secondary market. Investors who purchased securities on the secondary
    market must seek leave to bring a claim pursuant to Part XXIII.1, section 138.3
    of the <em>Securities Act</em> if the prospectus contains a misrepresentation.
    Section 138.3(1) (under Part XXIII.1) extends a remedy to any purchaser
    alleging a misrepresentation in a document, with different burdens of proof
    depending on whether the document is a “core document”, which includes a
    prospectus, or any other document: <em>Securities Act</em>, ss. 138.1,
    138.4(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It would upset the “delicate balance” struck by the legislature to
    allow all Class members to bypass the requirements of Part XXIII.1 and proceed
    under s.&nbsp;130 when only some are entitled to a remedy under that provision: <em>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Green</em>, 2015 SCC 60, [2015] 3
    S.C.R. 801, at para. 69, <em>per </em>Côté J. The “limits built into the
    scheme” of Part XXIII.1 are deliberate and are carefully calibrated to balance
    the interests of various market participants: <em>Green, </em>at para. 69.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While this conclusion creates a somewhat artificial distinction
    between Class members as none of them knew whether they were purchasing a
    Creation Unit or a unit which had previously circulated on the secondary
    market, this interpretation is consistent with the manner that ETFs are
    distributed and regulated, as well as the wording of s. 130 itself.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>However, I accept that Mr. Wright has not pled the material facts
    necessary to establish that he has a cause of action under s. 130 as he did not
    plead that he purchased one or more Creation Units. Under s. 5(1)(a), the
    representative plaintiff must have a reasonable cause of action against the
    defendant: <em>Darmar</em>, at paras. 37-38, citing <em>Taylor v. Canada
    (Attorney General)</em>, 2012 ONCA 479, 111 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 21.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As a result, I conclude that the statement of claim discloses no
    reasonable cause of action under s. 130 but grant leave to amend the statement
    of claim to allow Mr. Wright to assert that he is a holder of a Creation Unit
    and is entitled to a remedy under s. 130. Based on the certification judge’s
    findings, it is clear some Class members were holders of Creation Units and Mr.
    Wright may be a holder of a Creation Unit: <em>Lawrence v. Atlas Cold Storage
    Holdings Inc.</em> (2006), 34 C.P.C. (6th) 41 (Ont. S.C.). The certification
    judge’s order was made “without prejudice to [Mr. Wright] commencing a proposed
    class action relying on Part XXIII.1 of the Ontario <em>Securities Act,</em><em><span

    leave to assert that statutory cause of action.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>5. DISPOSITION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I allow the appeal in part on the basis that the statement of claim
    discloses a reasonable cause of action in negligence. I further hold that there
    is no reasonable cause of action under s. 130 as pleaded but would allow the
    appellant leave to amend the statement of claim to assert that he is a holder
    of a Creation Unit and is entitled to a remedy under s. 130. The certification
    judge’s order is set aside save for the order providing that it is “without

    determine whether the remaining criteria for certification are met.</span></p>
