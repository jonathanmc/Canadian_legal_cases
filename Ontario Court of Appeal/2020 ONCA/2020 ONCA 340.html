  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Gregory Tuffnail was seriously injured in a
    single-vehicle crash on September 13, 2009, following a rural wedding
    reception. The other passenger, Kristopher Petrie, was killed. Tuffnail and the
    driver, Steven Meekes, had been served alcohol at the reception. The groom,
    Thomas Bolton, had hosted the reception. Steve Coulthard was the bartender. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Tuffnail and his family  to whom I refer
    individually and collectively as Tuffnail  commenced an action against
    Meekes, Bolton and State Farm, Tuffnails automobile insurer. Tuffnail claimed
    that the collision and resulting injuries were caused by Meekes and Boltons negligence
    and/or, in the case of Bolton, breach of the provisions of the <em>Liquor
    Licence Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19. In the case of State Farm, Tuffnail
    sought a declaration that they were entitled to coverage under the OPCF 44R (Ontario
    Policy Change Form 44R  Family Protection Coverage endorsement), the optional
    underinsured motorist coverage Tuffnail had purchased from State Farm. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>State Farm defended Tuffnails claim for a
    declaration that Tuffnail was entitled to coverage under the OPCF 44R and
    brought a third party claim against Coulthard for contribution and indemnity in
    respect of amounts it was required to pay under the OPCF 44R. Bolton also
    brought a third party claim against Coulthard. Both State Farm and Bolton
    alleged that Coulthards negligence and/or breach of the <em>Liquor Licence Act</em> caused or contributed to the accident. Tuffnail did not sue Coulthard. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 10, 2017, following a six-week trial, the
    jury awarded damages and apportioned liability among Meekes, Bolton,<a

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Meekes (the driver)  65%</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Bolton (the host)  20.03%</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Taking Tuffnails contributory negligence into
    account, the net amount payable to Tuffnail is $3,435,034.71. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The following insurance coverage was available
    to the tortfeasors:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Meekes  $200,000</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Bolton  $2,000,000</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Petries family were plaintiffs in a companion
    action. The Petrie plaintiffs agreed to be bound by the findings of liability
    and apportionment of damages in the Tuffnail action. According to counsel, Meekes
    and Boltons policy limits were subject to <em>pro rata</em> sharing with the
    Petrie plaintiffs, with Tuffnail entitled to 94.89 percent of the proceeds.
    Accordingly, Tuffnail is entitled to $189,780 from Meekes and $1,897,800 from
    Bolton. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This does not cover Tuffnails loss. The net
    amount Tuffnail is entitled to under the judgment exceeds the aggregate of
    Meekes, Boltons and Coulthards insurance coverage. Key issues on the appeal impact
    how much State Farm is required to pay to Tuffnail under the OPCF 44R and how,
    given the shortfall, the amount recovered should be divided between State
    Farm and Tuffnail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>State Farm, Tuffnail and Coulthard sought
    numerous post-verdict rulings, many of which were inter-related. They were
    heard between June 2017 and April 2019, and the judgment is dated July 23,
    2019. Each of State Farm, Tuffnail and Coulthard appeals the judgment, arguing
    that the trial judge made various errors in her post-verdict rulings. They
    raise the following five issues:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>State Farm argues that the trial judge erred in her interpretation of
    s. 7 of the OPCF 44R, leading to an erroneous calculation of the amount State
    Farm is required to pay Tuffnail;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> Tuffnail argues that the trial judge erred in ordering that State
    Farm share any amounts it recovers by way of subrogation with Tuffnail until
    Tuffnail receive[s] full indemnification pursuant to the terms of the OPCF 44R
    endorsement and, by way of conditional cross-appeal, State Farm argues that
    the trial judge erred in requiring it to share at all;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Tuffnail argues that the trial judge erred in limiting Coulthards liability
    to Bolton to a proportion of the total judgment equal to the 11.12% of fault
    found by the jury;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>State Farm argues that the trial judge improperly exercised her
    discretion to award prejudgment interest at a rate higher than the bank rate;
    and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Coulthard argues that the trial judge erred in denying him leave to
    amend his pleadings, after the jury returned their verdict, to plead
    limitations defences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A sixth issue  the costs awarded to Tuffnail 
    was resolved by the parties before the appeal was heard. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I address the five alleged errors, in turn.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>1. Did the trial

lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In para. 6 of her judgment, the trial judge
    ordered State Farm to pay Tuffnail the sum of $800,000, which the parties agree
    is the limit of coverage under the OPCF 44R.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

    applies when, for an additional premium, an Ontario insured purchases optional
    underinsured motorist coverage. Meekes was an inadequately insured motorist
    within the meaning of the OPCF 44R: he had motor vehicle liability coverage for
    only $200,000, an amount less than the $1,000,000 limit of Tuffnails family
    protection coverage under the OPCF 44R.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Pursuant to s. 7 of the OPCF 44R, the amount
    payable by an insurer (State Farm) to an eligible claimant (Tuffnail) is excess
    to an amount received by the eligible claimant from any source, and is excess
    to amounts that were available to the eligible claimant from nine enumerated
    sources. This case is concerned with amounts available from the source
    enumerated in s. 7(b): the insurers of a person jointly liable with the inadequately
    insured motorist. Section 7(b) provides as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>7.        The amount payable under this change
    form to an eligible claimant is excess to an amount received by the eligible

    plaintiffs to seek recovery from all reasonably possible tortfeasors. The trial
    judge characterized the courts comments in <em>Loftus</em> as <em>obiter</em> and noted that the court did not consider the change in language between the

    claimant fromthe insurers of <span class=Underline>a person jointly liable
    with the inadequately insured motorist</span>. Tuffnail argues that Coulthard
    is a third party only and, therefore, cannot be jointly liable to Tuffnail.
    Further, in her ruling of January 23, 2019  made about 16 months after her
    ruling interpreting s. 7 of the OPCF 44R  the trial judge found that Coulthard
    is <span class=Underline>severally</span> liable to Bolton: <em>Tuffnail v.

    jointly liable to Tuffnail, his insurance coverage would be available to
    Tuffnail, within the meaning of s. 7(b). But Tuffnail adds that a person cannot
    be jointly liable unless and until so found, and the trial judge did not find
    Coulthard jointly liable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Tuffnails argument on appeal that Coulthard is
    not jointly liable to Tuffnail sits uneasily with Tuffnails position before
    the trial judge as reflected in the January 23, 2019 reasons. In that ruling
    Tuffnail took the position that Coulthard was jointly and severally liable to
    Tuffnail for the full amount of the damages awarded by the jury and that the
    Bolton Estate was entitled to recover from Coulthard a proportionate share of
    the plaintiffs damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, Coulthard is jointly liable
    to Tuffnail within the meaning of s. 7(b), his insurance is available to
    Tuffnail within the meaning of s. 7(b), and accordingly, State Farm is entitled
    to deduct the limits of Coulthards insurance coverage in calculating the
    amount it is required to pay to Tuffnail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In short, the trial judges determination that
    Coulthards policy was not available to Tuffnail resulted from the fact that
    Tuffnail had not commenced a claim against Coulthard in their own name and
    named Coulthard as a defendant. She was not asked to and did not consider
    whether Coulthard was jointly liable through the lens of the State Farm
    subrogated action against Coulthard. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, while State Farm framed its
    claim against Coulthard as a claim for contribution and indemnity in respect of
    any amounts it is called upon to pay Tuffnail, it actually makes a subrogated
    claim against Coulthard on behalf of Tuffnail. The legal consequence of State
    Farms claim is that Coulthards liability to Tuffnail was effectively put in
    issue. In finding that State Farm had a right of subrogation against Coulthard
    under s. 20 of the OPCF 44R, the trial judge necessarily found that Coulthard
    is jointly liable with Meekes. </span></p>

    providing for <em>pro rata</em> sharing only until Tuffnail receives full
    indemnification pursuant to the terms of the OPCF 44R endorsement, rather than
    until they receive full indemnification under the judgment. They submit that
    this is a clear, and possibly unintentional, error. On Tuffnails argument, the
    loss or damage suffered in s. 278(2) means the amount of damages awarded to
    him, as reflected in the judgment, that will not be recovered from the
    defendants in the action or from State Farm under the OPCF 44R, plus State
    Farms payment to Tuffnail. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>State Farm argues that there was no error. As I
    understand its argument, it says that, in this context, the loss or damage
    suffered in s. 278(2) means the limit of coverage under the OPCF 44R, which it
    describes as Tuffnails underinsured loss. Accordingly, once Tuffnail receives the
    $800,000 limit of coverage under OPCF 44R, he has received the maximum indemnity
    that he is contractually entitled to and State Farm is not required to share
    anything recovered in the subrogated action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If this court accepts Tuffnails argument that
    there is an error in the judgment, State Farm argues, by way of conditional

    two reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, State Farm argues that s. 278(2) of the <em>Insurance
    Act</em> does not apply to it because its right of subrogation arose under s.
    20 of the OPCF 44R. Section 20 of the OPCF 44R contains no <em>pro rata</em> sharing requirement and s. 278(2) cannot be imported into s. 20. Accordingly,
    it is entitled to recover in priority to Tuffnail. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, in the alternative, it also argues that
    s. 278(2) only applies to property damages. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>State Farm does not argue that s. 278(2) does
    not apply to excess insurance or where the insurer frames its subrogated claim
    against the tortfeasor as a third party claim, in the insurers name, for
    contribution and indemnity in respect of any amounts it is called to pay its
    insured. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response to State Farms cross-appeal, Tuffnail
    argues that s. 278(2) applies in this instance. </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>a) There was an
    error in the judgment</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>State
    Farms argument respecting the alleged error in the judgment seems to have been
    premised on the requirement in the judgment that it pay Tuffnail $800,000 under
    the OPCF 44R. Given that State Farm has been successful on the first issue, <span
lang=EN-CA>its liability under the OPCF 44R is reduced from $800,000 to
    $347,454.71 and Tuffnail will not receive the limit of coverage under the OPCF
    44R.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, even without taking into account State
    Farms success on the first issue, I agree with Tuffnail that the trial judgment
    as written contains what is possibly an unintentional error. To require <em>pro
    rata</em> sharing of those amounts that State Farm receives by way of
    subrogation only until Tuffnail receives full indemnification pursuant to the
    terms of the OPCF 44R endorsement makes no sense. Had the trial judge intended
    to give effect to State Farms position that indemnification for the purpose of
    s. 278(2) is achieved on Tuffnails recovery of the OPCF 44R policy limit, there
    would have been no need to provide both for State Farms payment of $800,000
    under the OPCF 44R and <em>pro rata</em> sharing with Tuffnail out of State
    Farms subrogation recoveries.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At least notionally, an insurer pays under an
    insurance contract <span class=Underline>before</span> it can seek to recover,
    by way of subrogation, the amounts that it has paid its insured. Subsection
    278(2) is about sharing the recovery. The wording at issue in paragraph 7 of
    the judgment gives no effect to the purpose of s. 278(2). It results in the <em>pro
    rata</em> sharing ending before it would even begin.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also note that State Farms argument would
    require this court to read the words the loss or damage suffered in s. 278(2)
    as really meaning the maximum possible loss or damage recoverable under the
    OPCF 44R. Among other things, the maximum possible loss is inconsistent with
    the clear wording of the section which requires that the loss have been
    suffered. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The point I decide is a narrow one: did the
    trial judge err in providing for <em>pro rata</em> sharing only until Tuffnail
    receives full indemnification pursuant to the terms of the OPCF 44R
    endorsement? While the parties attempted to give us assistance on the
    interpretation of s. 278(2) at the hearing of the appeal, the correct
    interpretation of s. 278(2) was not explored below and I am not satisfied that the
    court has a sufficient record to more broadly address the correct
    interpretation of s. 278(2). My conclusion that the trial judgment contains a
    possibly unintentional error (and my conclusion below that s. 278(2) applies)
    are based on the arguments made by the parties. I make no comment on Tuffnails
    precise interpretation of and calculations under s. 278(2). </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span
lang=EN-CA>b) Subsection 278(2) applies</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to State Farms arguments on its
    cross-appeal, I disagree that s. 278(2) cannot apply to its right of subrogation
    under the OPCF 44R. While, as State Farm asserts, its right of subrogation
    arose under the OPCF 44R, State Farm also acquired a right of subrogation under
    the stricter provisions of s. 278(1) of the <em>Insurance Act</em>. Section
    278(1) provides that an insurer who makes any payment or assumes liability
    therefor under a contract is subrogated By virtue of the judgment, if not
    before, State Farm assumed liability for payment under the OPCF 44R, thereby
    meeting the stricter pre-condition for subrogation in s. 278(1). Moreover,
    State Farm will have made payment under the OPCF 44R by the time the issue of
    sharing of recovery arises.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I have said, the OPCF 44R is silent on what
    happens where the net recovery is insufficient to provide complete recovery. Subsection
    278(2) fills that gap. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, I reject State Farms argument that s.
    278 only applies to claims for property damages. There is nothing in the
    section that suggests that this is the case. Moreover, under the legislative
    scheme, subrogation rights in respect of property damage are narrowly limited.
    Property damage is addressed through a direct compensation scheme in the <em>Insurance
    Act</em>; the insureds own insurer is liable to the extent that the insured is
    not responsible for the accident: Denis Boivin, <em>Insurance Law</em>, 2nd ed.
    (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2015), at pp. 510-11. An insurers right of
    subrogation in respect of damage to an automobile is specifically dealt with in
    s. 263(5)(b). Except as permitted in the narrowly enumerated instances by ss. 6
    to 8 of the regulation <em>Automobile Insurance</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 664,
    insurers have no subrogation right. There would have been no need to
    specifically include a general subrogation right in s. 278 if subrogation were
    restricted to the narrow property damage circumstances already designated by
    the <em>Automobile Insurance</em><i> </i>regulation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I would allow Tuffnails appeal and
    dismiss State Farms conditional cross-appeal of para. 7 of the judgment and
    alter para. 7 of the judgment to provide that:</span></p>

    further $75,000 towards costs and disbursements, as representing Meekes and
    his insurers full contribution. The agreement provided that the defendants

    of Meekes admission of liability and agreement to limit his liability in the
    settlement agreement, Meekes effectively became a non-party; <em>Endean</em> directs that a non-partys fault should not be considered in apportioning
    liability; and the trial judge accordingly erred in considering the jurys
    finding as to the degree to which Meekes was at fault in calculating Boltons
    entitlement to contribution from Coulthard. Tuffnail does not otherwise
    challenge the trial judges reasoning. Tuffnail submits that proportional
    division of Meekes 65 percent results in Bolton being 64.3 percent at fault
    and Coulthard being 35.7 percent at fault. Accordingly, Tuffnail submits,
    Coulthard should contribute 35.7 percent of the damages, or $1,125, 339.14 to
    Bolton. </span></p>

    that fault be reapportioned, without regard to Meekes. <em>Endean</em> is very
    different from this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In <em>Endean</em>, the plaintiffs suffered
    injury from devices implanted in their temporomandibular joints. They sued the
    hospital where the surgery was performed and the oral surgeons who performed
    the surgery and provided follow up care. Before trial, the plaintiffs settled
    with the oral surgeons and Pierringer Orders were made in each action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Pierringer Orders dismissed the actions
    against the oral surgeons and the crossclaims between the hospital and the oral
    surgeons and restricted the plaintiffs claims such that [the plaintiffs] will
    only claim those damages, if any, arising from the actions or omissions of the
    Defendant Hospital. The Pierringer Orders also required the statement of claim
    in each action to be amended to limit the claim against the hospital to its
    several liability or proportionate share of joint liability to the plaintiffs
    and to include an acknowledgment that the court at trial had the authority to
    adjudicate upon the apportionment of fault among all defendants who had been
    named in each action, i.e. the hospital and the oral surgeons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial was bifurcated and the trial judge
    first dealt with the issue of liability. Relying on this courts decision in <em>Taylor</em>,
    he apportioned 5 percent of the fault to the hospital; 20 percent of the fault
    to the oral surgeons; 50 percent of the fault to the manufacturer of the
    device; and 25 percent of the fault to the distributor of the device. Neither the
    manufacturer nor the distributor was ever party to the actions and both were
    bankrupt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the one action that he did not dismiss on the
    basis that it was statute barred, the trial judge granted judgment against the
    hospital for 5 percent of the damages that were to be assessed at the second
    phase of the trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, Zarnett J.A., writing for the court,
    concluded that the trial judge erred in doing so. While the Pierringer Order
    required the plaintiffs to reduce their claim against the hospital by the
    amount that would be apportioned to the oral surgeons at trial, the Pierringer
    Order did not authorize the reduction of recovery due to fault of any other
    person. For this reason, the fault of the manufacturer and the distributor
    should have been irrelevant to the hospitals liability to the plaintiffs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, while <em>Taylor</em> held that fault
    could be apportioned at trial to proposed third parties even though they were
    non-parties, the facts of <em>Taylor</em> were unique. In <em>Taylor</em><i>, </i>the
    plaintiff made clear by an amendment to the claim that the liability of the
    defendant was limited only to the defendants relative degree of fault. In
    other words, the plaintiff in <em>Taylor</em><i> </i>was not pursuing the
    defendant for 100 percent of its damages. Zarnett J.A.<i> </i>held that <em>Taylor</em><i> </i>does not entitle the court in any case to apportion fault to non-parties and
    then reduce the plaintiffs recovery by that apportioned share of fault: at
    para. 69.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To remedy the error of the trial judge, Zarnett
    J.A. reapportioned the fault of the non-party manufacturer and distributor to
    the hospital and the oral surgeons, in the same proportions as the hospitals
    and oral surgeons own degrees of fault: 20 percent and 80 percent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge in the instant appeal made no
    error in apportioning fault to Meekes. The position of Meekes is very different
    from that of the manufacturer and distributor in <em>Endean</em>. Meekes was a
    party to the action. He was not released from the action by the settlement
    agreement; in fact the settlement agreement specifically provided that the
    defendants were entitled to maintain their crossclaims for the purpose of
    trial. Moreover, there is no suggestion in the transcript that any party
    objected to the jury question which asked the jury to apportion fault to
    Meekes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I would dismiss Tuffnails appeal

    bank rate of 1.3 percent otherwise applicable in this case under ss. 127(1) and
    128(1) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, I agree with State Farm that
    the trial judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in two ways. First, in
    her reasons dated February 26, 2019, the trial judge misapplied the factor of
    changes in market interest rates specified under s. 130(2). Second, the trial
    judge considered an inappropriate factor, namely that [t]he case was
    undoubtedly conducted by [Tuffnail] with the understanding or expectation
    (although no vested entitlement) of a certain rate of prejudgment interest: <em>Tuffnail
    v. Meekes</em>, 2019 ONSC 1334 (February 26, 2019 reasons), at para. 16. As a
    result, deference to her exercise of discretion is displaced. Taking the
    factors under s. 130(2) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em> into account, I
    would not award prejudgment interest at a rate higher than the default rate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the trial judge noted, prior to January 1,
    2015, the rate of prejudgment interest on non-pecuniary damages in an action
    for personal injury was 5 percent: <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, ss.
    66(2)(w), 128(2); <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>. As the result of an
    amendment to the <em>Insurance Act</em>, as of January 1, 2015, prejudgment
    interest on damages for non-pecuniary loss in an action for loss or damage from
    bodily injury or death arising from the use or operation of an automobile was
    exempted from s. 128(2) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>. It is now
    calculated pursuant to s. 127(1) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em> by
    reference to the bank rate: <em>Insurance Act</em>, s. 258.3(8.1). The parties
    agree that the bank rate calculated under s. 127(1) of the <em>Courts of
    Justice Act</em> in this case is 1.3 percent. The amendment operates
    retrospectively: <em>Cobb v. Long Estate</em>, 2017 ONCA 717, 416 D.L.R. (4th)
    222, at paras. 66-105; <em>El-Khodr v. Lackie</em>, 2017 ONCA 716, 416 D.L.R.

lang=EN-CA>The trial judge averted to s. 130(2) and the circumstances of the

    the following:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA> The lawsuit commenced on March 18, 2011, arising from a collision
    on September 13, 2009.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA> With respect to s. 130(2)(a), there was some fluctuation in market

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA> The case was undoubtedly conducted by [Tuffnail] with the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Respectfully, the fluctuation in market rates adverted to by the
    trial judge was not relevant. She relied on this factor to justify awarding
    prejudgment interest at a rate higher than the default rate, but market rates
    never fluctuated above the 1.3 percent default rate during the litigation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Further, the trial judge improperly exercised her discretion to
    overrule the intention of the legislation amending the <em>Insurance Act</em> on the basis that Tuffnail had the understanding or the expectation (although
    no vested entitlement) of a certain rate of prejudgment interest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As MacFarland J.A. explained in <em>Cobb</em>, there can never be a
    vested entitlement to a certain rate of prejudgment interest because, while
    there is an entitlement to prejudgment interest, the actual rate was always
    subject to judicial discretion that could only be exercised at the time the
    damage award was made. As a result, there can be no expectation on the part of
    a litigant that he or she is entitled to prejudgment interest at any particular
    rate until the trial judge determines that rate: <em>Cobb</em>, at para. 90. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Cobb</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> is not authority for awarding
    prejudgment interest at a rate of 3 percent simply because the action was
    commenced before the <em>Insurance Act</em> was amended. This court concluded
    that the amendments to the <em>Insurance Act</em> were retrospective: at para.
    104. In <em>Cobb</em>, the trial judge had exercised his discretion to award
    prejudgment interest at a rate of 3 percent, while explicitly refraining from
    taking a position on the retrospectivity of the legislation. The defendant in <em>Cobb</em> was content with prejudgment interest at a rate of 3 percent, and this court
    did not interfere with the trial judges exercise of discretion to award
    prejudgment interest at that rate: at para. 105. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>MacFarland J.A. left open the possibility in <em>Cobb</em> that s.
    130 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em> could be used to ameliorate any
    perceived unfairness to litigants who commenced their actions before the
    effective date of the retrospective amendment: at para. 103. However, recent
    Superior Court decisions have relied on s. 130 to depart from the default rate where
    some external or prior unfairness made the retrospective application of the
    amendment particularly acute, such as where proceedings were delayed so that
    the amendment to the <em>Insurance Act</em> applied where it might not have
    otherwise. I endorse that view.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For example, in <em>A.B. v. Waite</em>, MacLeod J. noted that he was
    not entitled to exercise his discretion under s. 130 to overrule the
    retrospective effect of the legislation amending the <em>Insurance Act</em>:
    2018 ONSC 2151, at para. 11. In awarding interest at a rate of 4 percent under
    s. 130 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, he relied on the length of time
    the matter had been before the court and the fact that the trial was originally
    scheduled to take place before <em>Cobb</em> was decided. In relying on these
    factors, MacLeod J. was in essence relying on prior unfairness  delay in
    proceedings  in exercising his discretion under s. 130. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Similarly, in <em>McKnight v. Ontario (Transportation)</em>, Edwards
    J. declined to order interest at a rate greater than the default interest rate,
    noting that to do so would overrule the clear intention of the legislation
    amending the <em>Insurance Act</em>: 2018 ONSC 1742, at paras. 34-35.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As a result of the trial judges errors, deference to her exercise
    of discretion to award prejudgment interest at a rate other than the default
    rate prescribed by s. 127(1) is displaced. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Considering the factors in s. 130(2), the justness of the case does
    not require that prejudgment interest be allowed at a rate greater than the
    default rate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As indicated above, market interest rates have not fluctuated above
    the default rate during the period of the litigation. Under s. 130(2)(a) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, this factor weighs against departing from the
    default interest rate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the trial judge noted, the jury awarded Tuffnail damages which,
    subject to contributory negligence, were reasonably close to what they had
    proposed to the jury, albeit considerably less than what they had claimed in
    their statement of claim. In my view, this factor, considered under s.
    130(2)(e), is neutral. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>None of the remaining factors under s. 130(2) influence my
    conclusion. There are no unusual circumstances that warrant departing from the
    default rate. Nor is there special, case-specific unfairness resulting from the
    operation of the retrospective amendment. No advance payment was made. The
    trial judge indicated that there had been no suggestion that medical disclosure
    was withheld or delayed. The trial judge made no findings, and the parties made
    no submissions on appeal, about conduct of any party that tended to shorten or
    lengthen unnecessarily the duration of the proceeding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    decline to award prejudgment interest at a rate other than the default rate of
    1.3 percent calculated in accordance with s. 127(1) of the <em>Courts of

    26.01 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em> provides that leave to amend a
    pleading must be granted at any stage of an action, absent non-compensable
    prejudice. The trial judge acknowledged that it is possible to amend a
    pleading, even post-verdict, for example, to amend the prayer for relief to
    accord with a verdict on damages. However, she concluded that there was
    non-compensable prejudice and denied Coulthard leave to amend his pleadings. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In the case of Tuffnail, she held that evidence would undoubtedly
    have been led at trial on the issue of discoverability, and it was now too late
    to do so. Moreover, trial and pre-trial tactics might have been affected. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In the case of <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Petrie</span></em>,
    the trial judge proceeded on the basis that the limitation period in the <em>Trustee
    Act</em> applied, and that the concept of discoverability did not apply to the
    limitation period under that Act. Therefore, she did not rely on the inability
    to lead evidence on the issue of discoverability in her analysis. However, she
    concluded that there was non-compensable prejudice because the <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Petrie</span></em>s strategy in proceeding with the
    case would undoubtedly have been affected. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Coulthards main argument on appeal is that the trial judges finding
    of non-compensable prejudice constitutes a palpable and overriding error: he
    had raised the possibility of a limitation defence some three years before the
    trial commenced and there was no evidentiary basis for the trial judges
    finding of prejudice. Rather, her finding of prejudice was based on speculation
    that Tuffnail would have led evidence on discoverability, or that trial tactics <span class=Underline>might</span> have been different.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I reject this argument. The trial judges finding of non-compensable
    prejudice is entitled to deference. Moreover, I agree with her conclusion. Had
    Coulthard raised a limitations defence earlier, Tuffnail may have led different
    evidence at trial, and both Tuffnail and the Petrie plaintiffs may have made
    different pre-trial strategy and settlement decisions. This is not improper
    speculation. Moreover, at some point, the delay in seeking an amendment will
    be so lengthy, and the justification so inadequate, that prejudice to the
    responding party is presumed. In this event, the onus to rebut the presumed
    prejudice lies with the moving party: <em>Klassen v. Beausoleil</em><i>, </i>2019

lang=EN-CA> Coulthard also argued that the trial judge erred in law because she
    held that only minor amendments can be made post-verdict. Respectfully, this
    misconstrues her reasons. As noted above, she acknowledged that amendments can
    be made post-verdict, and gave an example of when they might be allowed. She
    dismissed Coulthards motion to amend because of her finding of non-compensable
    prejudice, not because she categorized it as a non-minor amendment. </span></p>

    continued by Sharon Carlene Drown, as Litigation Administrator for the Estate of

lang=EN-CA> The limit of coverage is determined by s. 4 of the OPCF 44R. That
    section indicates that coverage under the OPCF 44R is excess to the total of
    all limits of motor vehicle liability insurance held by the inadequately
    insured motorist (Meekes) and any person jointly liable with that motorist.
    Separate and apart from the question of whether Coulthard was jointly liable
    with Meekes, the Bolton and Coulthard policies were not motor vehicle liability
    insurance policies. Thus, State Farms maximum liability under the OPCF 44R is
    $800,000 (i.e. the amount by which the $1,000,000 of family protection coverage
    under the OPCF 44R exceeds the $200,000 limit of the Meekes motor vehicle
    policy).</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> I </span>note that Tuffnail does not argue that if Coulthard is
    jointly liable to Tuffnail, the amount deductible under s. 7 of OPCF 44R is the
    amount of State Farms claim for contribution and indemnity, to the extent it
    is characterized as such, and not the limits of Coulthards insurance policy.
    For the purposes of my analysis, I therefore accept that the amount deductible is
    the limits of Coulthards insurance policy. </p>

lang=EN-CA> <em>Napier v. Hunter</em>, [1993] A.C. 713 (H.L.) provides support
    for the proposition that where insurance is layered, subrogated recovery is
    applied on a downward basis, beginning with the top layer of insurance.
    Accordingly, it appears that in the United Kingdom an excess insurer may recover
    its loss first from the subrogation proceeds, where those proceeds are payments
    in respect of the layer of insurance the excess insurer agreed to cover.
    However, to my knowledge, <em>Napier</em><i> </i>has not been considered with
    respect to this particular point by a Canadian court. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA> State Farm seeks to recover from Coulthards policy  an amount
    deducted in calculating its liability to Tuffnail under the OPCF 44R. There is
    authority for the proposition that an insurer is not entitled to recover
    payments allocated to uninsured losses: <em>T&amp;N Limited v. Royal &amp; Sun
    Alliance plc</em>, [2003] EWHC 1016 (Ch), at paras. 605-606. Query whether the
    amount of Coulthards policy is an uninsured loss under the OPCF 44R. However, none
    of the parties have appealed or dispute the trial judges conclusion that State
    Farm is entitled to pursue recovery of its subrogated interest against
    Coulthard. They dispute only whether and how the <i>pro rata</i> sharing
    mechanism operates. My analysis accordingly proceeds on the assumption that State
    Farm is entitled to recovery from Coulthards policy. I leave an insurers
    right of recovery against amounts deducted in calculating its liability under the
    OPCF 44R for another day. </span></p>

    on March 8, 2019. On April 10, 2019, the parties appeared before the trial
    judge to seek clarification of her January 23, 2019 reasons. At this hearing,
    counsel for Tuffnail relied on <em><span lang=EN-CA>Endean</span></em><i><span
lang=EN-CA> </span></i>and argued that Coulthard should owe Bolton 35.7 percent
    of the damages awarded by the jury. The trial judge held that she was not being
    asked to clarify her January 23, 2019 reasons, but was being asked to
    reconsider them. She declined to do so, noting that appeals had already been
    filed.</p>
