    was joking in his explicitly sexualized messages. This caused him to err in his

    the respondent was joking because he felt uncomfortable when he gave his statement.

    your boyfriend’s penis?” This apparently made her cry. N.B. also testified that
    the respondent asked him for a photo, attempted to masturbate in front of him,
    and attempted to touch him in a sexual manner. The trial judge admitted this
    evidence for the purpose of rebutting the respondent’s claim that he was

    discussed below, does not include a defence of joking. However, he found that
    the Crown had failed to prove the requisite elements of the child pornography
    and luring offences. The following passage contains the trial judge’s analysis:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. McSween is most certainly inappropriate in
    his texts. It is quite understandable that a parent seeing these texts would be
    concerned. This is not a mature man in his forties talking, it is another
    teenage boy with all the angst and [immaturity] of young teenagers. It is teen
    locker room banter. It is not what any parent would want their teenage sons
    exposed to coming from another adult. Some might well object to it between
    young teenagers.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. McSween gives the impression of being
    somewhat naïve and as having the immaturity of a young teenager. As an example,
    he indicates that he would have looked at a dick pic had one been sent. There
    is no suggestion of anything salacious. It was said just as an immature
    teenager in his early teen years would have said it. I accept Mr. McSween’s
    testimony in this regard. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I am certainly left with a reasonable doubt as
    to Mr. McSween’s intent. I cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    Crown’s case has met the requisite level to show his intent for these offences. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>I cannot find he was serious in his text
    messages. I cannot find these texts posed an undue risk [to] persons under 18
    as set out in Section 161.3(6)(b).</span></u><span lang=EN-CA> I use this only
    as a guide as Subsection (b) must be read as qualifying Subsection (a) which,
    as the Crown correctly points out, does not contain an exception for jokes. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>This lack of risk and lack of dominant
    sexual characteristic is particularly evident when looked at in the light that
    only 36 of the total of over 4,000 pages of text messages are raised.</span></u><span
lang=EN-CA> I have a reasonable doubt that this would meet the definition of
    child pornography, there <u>is any attempt to lure [anyone] under 18 years old
    for a sexual purpose</u>, or that Mr. McSween was counselling or promoting
    sexual activity with people under 18. <u>I do not find the written material to

    does not punish mere thoughts about sex with children. It punishes the creation
    of child pornography in tangible formats (i.e., visual representations, audio
    recordings, and written materials) and the various ways in which they may be
    accessed, handled, shared, and transmitted. These items do not gain or lose
    their child pornographic features based on the motive of person who creates or
    distributes them, whether they are driven by lasciviousness, curiosity,
    financial gain, extortion, humiliation, or otherwise. The respondent’s claim

    draw the line at the extreme end of the spectrum concerned with depictions of
    intimate sexual activity represented in a graphic and unambiguous manner. In
    arriving at this conclusion, McLachlin C.J.C. relied, at para. 45, on
    Parliament’s decision to include the word “explicit” to describe the activity
    depicted: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The first indication is Parliament’s use of
    the word “explicit” to describe the activity depicted.&nbsp; Parliament could
    have simply referred to “sexual activity”.&nbsp; Instead, it chose “explicit
    sexual activity”.&nbsp; “Explicit” must be given meaning. According to
    the&nbsp;<i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary&nbsp;</i>(1998), “explicit” in the
    context of sexual acts means “describing or representing nudity or intimate
    sexual activity”.&nbsp; Similarly, “explicit” according to the&nbsp;<i>New
    Oxford Dictionary of English</i>&nbsp;(1998) means “describing or representing
    sexual activity in a graphic fashion”.&nbsp; This suggests that the law catches
    only depictions of sexual intercourse and other non-trivial sexual acts.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This restricted meaning is supported by the
    fact that in creating other offences, like sexual assault, Parliament uses the
    word “sexual” without any modifiers.&nbsp; To constitute sexual assault, the
    sexual aspect of the contact must be clear.&nbsp; The addition of the modifier
    “explicit” in&nbsp;s. 163.1&nbsp;suggests that this at least is required.&nbsp;</span></p>

    judge was convinced that, because only a fraction of the communications between
    the respondent and J.V. were sexual in nature (36 out of over 4,000 pages of
    text messages), it could not be said that messages of a sexual nature formed a
    “dominant characteristic” of their entire correspondence for the purposes of s.

    That is, if a clearly sexualized photo of a child is found in an otherwise
    typical family photo album, the sexualized photo would somehow lose its
    attributes as child pornography because it forms such a small part of the
    collection. An interpretation of s. 163.1 that would so easily place child
    pornography beyond the reach of the section, through mere camouflage or
    disguise, would clearly frustrate Parliament’s intent: see </span><em><span

    45, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 197, at paras. 31-32. This aspect of  the Crown’s appeal
    may be decided on the basis of the trial judge’s interpretation of the fault
    requirements; in the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the
    argument under </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>J.M.H</span></em><i><span

    judge’s reasons that addresses s. 172.1. In fact, the trial judge only made one
    reference child luring in his reasons: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have a reasonable doubt that this would meet
    the definition of child pornography, there is any attempt to lure [anyone]

    two errors in his interpretation of s. 172.1: he failed to consider that s.
    172.1 criminalizes communication for the purpose of facilitating the commission
    of an offence, and he erred by holding that the Crown must prove that the
    “luring” was for “a sexual purpose”.</span></p>

    significance that this heading might otherwise have in interpreting s. 172.1 (see
    Sullivan, at  §§ 14.50-14.58) is muted by the fact that the section specifically
