  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault
    and failing to comply with a youth court order. The appellant was 16 years of
    age at the time of the incident. His brother and the complainant were 15 years
    of age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant and appellant testified at trial.
    There is no dispute that the complainant attended the appellants residence and
    whisky was consumed. Nor is there dispute that sexual activity took place or
    that the appellant had vaginal intercourse with the complainant while his
    brother placed his penis in her mouth. Nor is there dispute that the brothers traded
    positions a couple of times during the encounter in the basement of the
    appellants home. Nor is there dispute that, at some point after the sexual
    activity involving both brothers ended, the complainant and appellant were in
    the shower together and another act of sexual intercourse took place. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sole issue at trial was whether the complainant
    consented to the sexual activity. The complainant said that none of it was
    consented to, that she cried through much of it and told them to stop.  The
    appellant maintains that it was all consented to.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave lengthy reasons for
    judgment, which understandably focused upon questions of credibility and
    reliability. He explained why he rejected the appellants evidence about
    consent and why he believed the complainant on this crucial point. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is predicated on three alleged
    errors. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge
    misapprehended four points of evidence. With one exception, we do not agree
    that the points raised are properly characterized as misapprehensions of
    evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For instance, the appellant argues that the
    trial judge misapprehended the evidence when he characterized a text message,
    sent by the appellant to the complainant, as an admission against interest. The
    text message read: shouldnt have tried it the second time but I stopped when
    you told me to. We do not agree that the trial judge misapprehended the
    evidence about the text message. The trial judge simply drew an available
    inference from that evidence, considered in the context of all of the evidence,
    that when the appellant acknowledged that he shouldnt have tried it a second
    time, he was acknowledging that he knew the complainant was not consenting.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also takes issue with what he
    calls the trial judges speculation, when he opined that [the complainant] may
    have reasonably thought that screaming for help, or telling the boys mother
    that her sons had just raped her, might endanger her further. This was not
    speculation. There was evidence that the appellant had told the complainant
    that his mother was a psycho. There is no misapprehension of evidence around
    this point. In any event, the impugned sentence was entirely irrelevant to the
    result. Whether the complainant raised a hue and cry during or immediately
    after the assault, was irrelevant to whether she was sexually assaulted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that the trial judge
    improperly speculated about why the appellant had sent a text message to the
    complainant shortly after the offence, suggesting that his brother had not been
    involved in the sexual activity. The appellant testified that he sent that
    message at a time when he could not recall his brothers involvement in the
    sexual activity. According to the appellant, he only recovered that memory at a
    later point in time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected that explanation and concluded
    that the text message was motivated by the appellants desire to see if it
    would cause [the complainant] to question her own recollection of the nights
    events and/or to dissuade her from contacting the police. We see no improper
    speculation in this comment. It was open to the trial judge to reject the
    appellants explanation as to why he had sent the message. It was also open to
    the trial judge to conclude that the message was sent for the exact purpose he
    articulated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While we agree that the trial judge
    misapprehended one piece of evidence, regarding the timing of a message sent by
    the complainant to her mother, that misapprehension of evidence is immaterial
    to the verdict. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant argues that the trial
    judge applied uneven scrutiny to the Crown and defence evidence. We do not
    agree. In our view, the trial judge engaged in a proper individualized
    assessment of the different evidence offered by the different witnesses: <em>R.
    v. R.R.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em><em> </em>2020
    ONCA 327, at para. 20. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One of the factors that the appellant points to
    as revealing uneven scrutiny of the evidence is how the trial judge dealt with
    the complainants evidence as to whether she changed into her shorts in the
    washroom. The appellant argues that she was inconsistent on this point and, if
    the trial judge had applied even scrutiny, this inconsistency would have
    damaged her credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree that this point demonstrates
    uneven scrutiny of the evidence. This is a repeat of the argument from trial,
    an argument that the trial judge specifically dealt with and disposed of. He
    simply concluded that there was no inconsistency in the evidence. That was a factual
    conclusion that the record supported and he was entitled to arrive at. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant raises other concerns
    about the trial judges credibility assessments. Credibility assessments are
    owed strong deference: <em>R. v. R.A.</em>, 2017 ONCA 714, 421 D.L.R. (4th)
    100, at para. 44. We see nothing that would cause us to interfere in those
    findings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant maintains that the trial judge
    erred when he concluded that the appellant was upset after the sexual encounter
    because he knew that he had raped the complainant and was deeply troubled
    regarding the prospects of her going to the police and reporting the rape. The
    appellant objects to the trial judges conclusion on this issue. He maintains
    that his upset was caused by the fact that his marijuana was missing and he
    realized that he had just cheated on his girlfriend. That may have been his
    position at trial, but the trial judge acknowledged and rejected it. He was
    entitled to do so and we would not interfere with that finding.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that the complainant
    had a strong motive to fabricate the allegations, particularly given that she
    was confronted by the appellants girlfriend about the sexual encounter the
    morning after it occurred and before she had reported anything. Again, the
    trial judge was alive to this defence argument. He specifically addressed it.
    He stated the law on motive to fabricate correctly. He accepted the
    complainants evidence that she did not disclose the offence before her
    communications with the appellants girlfriend because she was still
    processing how to deal with the matter. This was a conclusion available on
    the record and one that is well explained in the reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
