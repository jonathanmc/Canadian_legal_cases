  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with a single count of
    sexual assault under s. 271 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. It was alleged that, during consensual
    sexual intercourse, the complainant told him to stop. He did so briefly, but
    then continued without her consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the preliminary inquiry, and in the absence
    of an application under s. 276 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, defence counsel asked the complainant, E.S., whether she
    previously had sex with the appellant. She said that she had not. The Crown did
    not object to this line of questioning. Ultimately, the appellant was committed
    to stand trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge heard two interrelated pre-trial
    applications. First, the defence applied under s. 276 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> to adduce evidence of other
    sexual activity between the appellant and E.S. The proposed evidence included
    the appellant’s claim that he had sexual intercourse with E.S. numerous times,
    and also that E.S. had performed fellatio on him. He produced a video recording
    of one episode of fellatio. The appellant wished to cross-examine E.S. on her
    preliminary inquiry testimony in which she denied previous sexual activity with
    the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, E.S. passed away before the trial. The
    Crown applied under s. 715 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> to admit E.S.’s preliminary inquiry testimony at trial. The
    appellant resisted this application, claiming that he did not have a full
    opportunity to cross-examine E.S. at the preliminary inquiry, particularly on
    the other sexual activity that he alleged. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the s. 276 application
    but admitted E.S.’s prior testimony under s. 715. The appellant testified at
    trial. He was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment for 15 months. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his conviction. He submits
    that the trial judge erred in how she decided both pre-trial applications, and in
    how she assessed the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would dismiss the appeal. The trial judge did
    not err in concluding that the evidence of prior sexual history was
    inadmissible. In addition to the reasons given by the trial judge, the
    application could also have failed because it was based on an improper
    foundation – E.S.’s answers to impermissible questions at the preliminary
    inquiry. The trial judge properly admitted E.S.’s preliminary inquiry testimony
    under s. 715 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> and made no errors in her assessment of the evidence as a whole.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>general background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>E.S. was 53 years old when she testified at the
    preliminary inquiry. She had known the appellant “for a couple years”. She bought
    marijuana from him “a couple of times” or “many times”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 11, 2016, around 11 p.m., she went to the
    appellant’s rooming house to buy marijuana. She had recently broken her right
    wrist and had a cast. She took some cans of beer with her. E.S. intended to get
    the marijuana then visit with her friend, Seppo, who lived next door to the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When E.S. arrived at the appellant’s room, he
    told her to sit on his bed. He left the room to get the marijuana. The
    appellant returned to the apartment and gave E.S. the marijuana. She gave him
    $20. When E.S. got up to leave, the appellant blocked her way. He said
    something to her, but she could not hear what he said because loud music was
    playing. Nonetheless, she knew that he wanted sex. E.S. remembered that the
    appellant lifted her onto the bed and penetrated her vagina, but she could not
    recall how her pants were removed. E.S. experienced pain and asked him to stop.
    He did so for a few minutes, but then resumed penetration, even though she tried
    to push him off. After the appellant finished, he helped E.S. off the bed. She
    got dressed and went to Seppo’s room. The entire incident lasted for about 15
    minutes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>E.S. told Seppo what had just happened. Seppo
    suggested she call the police. E.S. was initially scared because the appellant was
    a drug dealer and she was concerned he would “get somebody else after me.” Seppo
    ended up calling the police. The police arrived and E.S. was taken to the
    hospital in an ambulance. She was accompanied by a police officer, Constable
    Brayden Beck.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As already noted, E.S.’s preliminary inquiry
    testimony was admitted at trial under s. 715 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. The Crown also led the evidence
    of Constable Beck, who recounted aspects of E.S.’s statements from that night,
    some of which were inconsistent with her preliminary inquiry testimony. For
    instance, she told the officer that she had a beer and smoked a joint with the
    appellant before the sexual assault. She also told the officer that the
    appellant told her to remove her pants, and when she asked why, he said he was
    “going to fuck [her]”. E.S. said the appellant then pulled her pants down.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During his testimony, the appellant said that he
    had known E.S. since 2005. She often visited the rooming house to see her
    relatives and Seppo. He denied ever selling marijuana to E.S. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    did so right away. E.S. got up, put her underwear on, and draped her pants over

    first consenting. The trial judge framed the central issue in the trial as
    follows, at para. 8: “If I find that the accused stopped when asked, then he
    would be found not guilty of sexual assault. If I find that he did not stop

    of the narrow contentious issue – continued penetration in the face of

    The use of E.S.’s preliminary inquiry evidence on the s. 276 application effectively
    made E.S. a compellable witness in that proceeding, which was explicitly

    contention is that E.S. placed her credibility in issue by mispresenting the
    true nature of her relationship with the appellant (i.e., that he was her drug
    dealer, and nothing more). The only way that the appellant could dispel this
    misconception, and preserve his own credibility at trial, was through evidence
    of their prior sexual history. This submission, which is really just a
    variation on the same theme pursued at trial, was not made to the trial judge.
    Moreover, the misrepresentation that the appellant seeks to attribute to E.S. was
    not borne out by the evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant filed an application under s. 276.
    In his affidavit in support of the application, he said that he engaged in consensual
    sexual activity with E.S. five times before the events giving rise to the
    sexual assault charge. Three incidents involved sexual intercourse; others
    involved fellatio. The appellant tendered a video recording of E.S. performing
    fellatio on him in March 2016, before the offence date of May 11, 2016. During
    cross-examination on his affidavit, the appellant acknowledged making the video
    recording. The Crown advised the trial judge that she had reviewed the
    recording with E.S., who confirmed that it was authentic. </span></p>

    that the Crown was responsible for raising the issue of prior sexual history at
    the preliminary inquiry. Counsel submitted that he asked his questions of E.S.
    (set out in para. 21, above) to have E.S. “confirm what she meant by a romantic
    relationship, was a sexual relationship, which was first asked by the Crown”.
    Defence counsel continued:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>And it’s important to note that the issue of
    prior romantic or sexual activity is prohibited by either counsel from asking
    questions about that activity without first going through a section 276
    application. <u>It should be noted that the defence did not open the door, and
    this door was opened by the crown attorney</u>. [Emphasis added.] </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>Be reminded, Your Honour, that the issue
    was introduced by the Crown in examination in-chief</span></u><span lang=EN-CA>.
    If the crown had not asked those questions, I would never have been able to ask
    those questions, even to clarify what she meant by a romantic relationship at a
    hearing, whether it’s a preliminary hearing or a trial, without going through a
    276 application. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel submitted that he did not seek
    to admit the evidence for either of the twin myth purposes prohibited by s.
    276(1) (i.e., that E.S. was more likely to have consented to the sexual
    activity that forms the subject matter of the charge, or that she was less
    worthy of belief). He sought to challenge E.S.’s credibility by contradicting
    her answers to questions he asked at the preliminary inquiry. He said, “it does
    show that the complainant may have lied under oath to the Crown at a preliminary
    inquiry”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submitted that her “romantic
    relationship” question did not engage considerations of sexual activity, nor was
    it intended to do so. In relation to the impugned cross-examination, the Crown
    submitted:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There’s no indication of what Ms. S.
    understood the word “sex” to mean and in a colloquial sense the word “sex”
    means sexual intercourse. She wasn’t specifically asked about fellatio.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my submission there is no inconsistency
    insofar as she says she didn’t have sex with him and then there’s this video.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown further submitted that, given the
    narrow issue in the case – whether the appellant recommenced penetration after E.S.
    withdrew her consent – the evidence was irrelevant. The Crown argued that, even
    if the evidence impacted on E.S.’s credibility, standing alone, this was an
    insufficient basis for admission under s. 276, and that the issue was otherwise
    collateral.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ruled on the ss. 276 and 715
    applications in the same judgment: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Kuzmich</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>,<i> </i>2017 ONSC 7430. She recognized that, if she allowed the s.
    276 application, the Crown’s case would be at an end because E.S. was not
    available for cross-examination on her prior sexual history. Similarly, if the
    s. 715 application were denied, the Crown would be unable to proceed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After setting out the applicable framework under
    s. 276, including the factors to be weighed under s. 276(3), the trial judge
    provided the following analysis of this issue, at paras. 19-24:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While it was not part of the hearing before
    me, <u>I question whether the Crown did &quot;open the door&quot; to cross-examination
    of prior sexual activity when she asked the complainant if she and the
    Applicant had a romantic relationship.</u> The denial of a romantic
    relationship on the facts of this case, where the Applicant was the supplier of
    drugs to the complainant, is not sufficient to entitle the defence to introduce
    evidence of prior sexual activity between the Applicant and the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly the questions posed in
    cross-examination to the complainant at the preliminary inquiry do not rise to
    the level of inconsistency regarding evidence of a prior sexual encounter that
    would make evidence of a prior sexual encounter under s. 276 admissible in
    order to enable the Applicant to make full answer and defence</span></u><span
lang=EN-CA>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the hearing before me, the Crown conceded
    that there had been at least one instance of a prior sexual encounter in the
    form of one act of fellatio. <u>The Crown disputed that the complainant's
    testimony at the preliminary inquiry was inconsistent with this evidence
    because she was asked about whether she had had sex with the Applicant. She was
    not asked about fellatio.</u></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the Crown.</span></u><span
lang=EN-CA> The evidence from the preliminary inquiry is not sufficiently
    contradictory to engage the very limited ways in which prior sexual encounters
    of a complainant may be admissible. <u>To permit the defence to cross-examine
    the complainant on a prior sexual encounter with the Applicant and to permit
    the video of that prior encounter into evidence would prejudice the
    complainant's personal dignity and right of privacy</u>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find that the interests of justice would not
    be served in this case by admitting this evidence. I also find that this
    evidence is not of significant probative value and admitting it would prejudice
    the proper administration of justice. <u>Evidence of a prior act of fellatio is
    irrelevant to whether or not the complainant consented to the incident giving
    rise to these charges and is not sufficiently probative of the complainant's
    credibility so as to interfere with the Applicant's ability to make full answer
    and defence</u>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The defence application under s. 276 is

    submission that he was not seeking to invoke twin myth reasoning, and that he
    only wished to use the evidence to contradict E.S.’s assertion at the
    preliminary inquiry that she had never previously had sex with the appellant.
    She disagreed that a significant inconsistency had been established on the
    evidence at the preliminary inquiry. Moreover, the trial judge “[questioned]
    whether the Crown did ‘open the door’ to cross-examination of prior sexual
    history”. It was open to the trial judge to reach these conclusions on the
    record before her. I address these issues in the discussion below. I also
    consider the significance of non-compliance with s. 276 at the preliminary
    inquiry, as well the appellant’s alternative basis for admissibility, raised
    for the first time on appeal.</span></p>

    answers to the questions posed to her in cross-examination about whether she
    had previously had sex with the appellant. As noted above (see paras. 23-24), during
    his submissions on the application, defence counsel acknowledged that he had
    not complied with s. 276, but argued that he was not required to do so because
    the Crown introduced the issue through her questions of E.S. in-chief. The
    Crown did not respond to this issue in her submissions; the trial judge did not
    address the issue in her reasons.</span></p>

    on this basis. However, she submitted that, given the Crown’s failure to object
    when the questions were asked, the defence was entitled to rely on E.S.’s
    answers. Ms. Lai for the Crown relies heavily on what she asserts was an
    improper foundation for the s. 276 application.</span></p>

    that s. 276 applies at a preliminary inquiry. The opening words of s. 276(1) of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> signal its broad reach. The section applies to “proceedings in respect of an
    offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or
    (3) or section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273.” In my view, the plain
    wording of the section – “proceedings in respect of” – is not restricted to trial
    proceedings alone. The expression is more expansive and may include other proceedings,
    such as preliminary inquiries, or bail proceedings under Part XVI of the </span><em><span

    prior sexual history will be of no value at a preliminary inquiry in terms of
    committal; nor will it have much, if any, impact on the apparent strength of the
    Crown’s case in the context of bail proceedings. Nonetheless, the interests
    protected by s. 276 – “the equality, privacy and security rights of

    disagreed, and wrote, at para. 22: “[T]he complainant has not, in this case, opened
    any such door. And to the extent that the cross-examination at the preliminary

    mistaken belief in consent, even though this was not raised at trial. The court
    rejected this ground of appeal, partly on the basis that the appellant’s claim
    was based on testimony that was inadmissible – it touched on past sexual
    activity with the complainant, in the absence of a s. 276 application. Joyal
    J.A. (as he then was) said, at para. 49, that the appellant was “grounding his

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Without prior judicial consideration of the issue
    and a determination under s. 276.1, no evidence of the complainant's past

    never intended to open the door. Why would she? The Crown would gain no advantage
    whatsoever, whether tactical or otherwise, in triggering this issue at the

    the Crown that you’ve never had sex with Kevin before?” This was not what E.S.

    previous sexual episodes, some of which involved sexual intercourse. If these

    amount to a categorical assertion that the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>only</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> interactions that she ever had with the appellant was when she bought
    drugs from him. Moreover, her evidence that their sexual encounter that night
    was initially consensual undermined the relevance of appellant’s claim on appeal
    that E.S. gave misleading evidence about her relationship with the appellant. E.S.’s
    evidence did not amount to the type of “inconsistent statements regarding the
    existence of a sexual relationship” as contemplated in </span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>Harris</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. On the evidence that was before
    the trial judge at the time of the s. 276 application, the positions of the
    appellant and E.S. regarding the nature of their relationship did not differ
    greatly. They were in agreement that they had engaged in consensual sexual
    intercourse. The nature of their relationship that night was sexual. Whether
    they had sex on other occasions was not probative on the issue of whether the
    appellant resumed penetration after he stopped at the appellant’s request. It
    was not so fundamental to E.S.’s credibility that the exclusion of this
    evidence was, in the words of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Harris</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, “potentially devastating” to the appellant’s credibility. Without
    this foundation, the evidence could only have been used in a manner that was
    contrary to one of the twin myths prohibited by s. 276(1).</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Dann submits that, even if it could be said
    that E.S.’s answers were equivocal on the nature of the relationship, the trial
    judge treated them differently. She points to the following passage in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Kuzmich</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>(trial),
    at paras. 32-33: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, <u>she was not shaken on her
    evidence of what her plans had been the night in question or that she only ever
    visited the accused to purchase marijuana from him</u>. <u>She admitted to
    having smoked marijuana and shared a beer with the accused in the past,
    however, it was clear from her evidence that the accused was her supplier and
    not a friend with whom she partied</u>. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Conversely, I did not find the evidence of the
    accused to be believable. <u>In particular, the fact that he claimed not to be
    a supplier of marijuana to E.S. His testimony on this point does not make sense
    because there was no other reason for E.S. to be in his apartment.</u> The
    accused confirmed in his evidence that he and E.S. were only acquaintances who
    saw each other in the hallway on occasion when E.S. visited his neighbour,
    Seppo. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Standing alone, the trial judge’s reference that
    E.S. “only ever visited the accused to purchase marijuana from him” is more
    categorical than the evidence suggests. However, taken as a whole, the first
    paragraph in this passage presents an accurate rendition of E.S.’s evidence
    about the nature of her relationship with the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the manner in which the trial judge
    resolved the competing claims in the evidence about the nature of the
    relationship does not reveal any unfairness in the s. 276 ruling. The appellant
    submits that his assertion of not being E.S.’s drug dealer was unfairly
    undermined in the above-quoted passage. However, this takes us back to the
    manner in which the issue was litigated at trial. On his s. 276 application,
    the appellant did not explicitly deny selling drugs to E.S. It was not until he
    gave evidence at trial that he made this claim. Although it was undoubtedly the
    appellant’s right to proceed in this fashion, he cannot now claim that it
    rendered the s. 276 ruling unfair. Moreover, the appellant did not seek to
    reopen or readdress the issue after he testified: see </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R.V</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA>.</span></i><span lang=EN-CA>, at
    para. 74, concerning the ability of a trial judge to reconsider a s. 276 ruling

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On a more general level, Ms. Dann further
    submits that the trial judge’s findings were unfair to the appellant because she
    was aware of the evidence from the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir dire</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> concerning the prior sexual relationship, particularly the video
    recording, which was indisputable evidence of prior sexual activity. I disagree
    that there was anything improper in the trial judge’s approach. Having made her
    decision on the s. 276 application, the trial judge demonstrated discipline in
    deciding the case solely on the admissible evidence at trial. Had the case been
    tried by a judge and a jury, the jury would not have known about the video
    recording or the appellant’s affidavit evidence suggesting other sexual
    activity. The trial judge placed herself in the same position in deciding the
    ultimate issue in this case, disabusing her mind of what she had learned on the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>voir dire</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, as she was
    required to do.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    because the s. 276 application was dismissed, the trial judge was required to
    determine whether E.S.’s preliminary inquiry testimony was admissible under s.
    715 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span

    allowing the application. As she said, at para. 28: “Because I have denied the
    s. 276 application, the defence argument that they did not have a full
    opportunity to cross-examine the complainant fails. Therefore the evidence of
    the complainant from the preliminary inquiry may be admitted under s. 715 of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, with the

    by approaching the question from a perspective that was too narrow. Moreover, although
    the trial judge addressed certain aspects of s. 715, she failed to consider the

    at the trial of an accused, a person whose evidence was given at a previous

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An earlier version of this section survived a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> challenge in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Potvin</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525. As Wilson
    J. stated, at p. 553, the purpose of the section is to ensure that “evidence,
    even important and highly probative evidence, is not lost because of the unavailability
    of a witness at trial”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Court outlined a two-step process, one based
    on the textual pre-conditions for admissibility under the section, as well as a
    broad residual discretion to refuse admission of the prior testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the first stage, the disputed issue is
    typically whether there was “full opportunity to cross-examine” the witness.
    This was the main frame of reference before the trial judge in this case. In </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Lewis</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2009 ONCA 874, 249 C.C.C.
    (3d) 265, this court discussed the scope of the “full opportunity” requirement
    in s. 276. As Moldaver J.A. (as he then was) said, at para. 68:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The better approach, in my view, is to limit
    consideration of the &quot;full opportunity&quot; requirement to cases where,
    for example, a witness refuses to answer questions in cross-examination, a
    witness dies or disappears in the midst of cross-examination, or where the
    presiding judge curtails cross-examination by imposing improper limitations or
    restrictions. It should&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;apply where the failure to
    cross-examine stems from an accused person's ignorance of potentially useful
    information, no matter the cause or reason. Those situations, in my view, are
    best dealt with under trial fairness, where, as I have indicated, the reason
    for the missing information can properly be taken into account as a factor.
    [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In terms of the “opportunity to cross-examine”
    factor, the situation in this case did not fall within any of the scenarios
    contemplated by Moldaver J.A. in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Lewis</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. In his affidavit sworn in response to the Crown’s s. 715
    application, defence counsel identified the areas in which he would have sought
    to cross-examine E.S. had she not passed away before the trial. In addition to prior
    sexual history, counsel would have explored, “her credibility and her
    relationship with the rest of the tenants in the building and her relationship
    with the tenants with respect to the buying and selling of drugs.” Crucially,
    defence counsel admitted that, “[a]ll of these questions in cross-examination
    were not put to the witness for tactical reasons in order to test her
    credibility and reliability at a trial stage and not at the preliminary hearing
    stage.” Defence counsel did have an opportunity to cross-examine on these issues.
    He chose not to. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s claims are better suited to
    consideration under the residual discretion discussed in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Potvin</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> and </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Lewis</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. In describing this discretion, Wilson J. prescribed a cautious
    approach. She said, at p. 548: “I hasten to add, however, that such circumstances
    will be relatively rare and that the discretion to prevent unfairness is not a
    blanket authority to undermine the object of [s. 715(1)] by excluding evidence
    of previous testimony as a matter of course.” Subsequent decisions of this
    court continue to endorse this approach: see </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Saleh</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2013 ONCA 742, 303 C.C.C. (3d) 431, at para. 78; </span><em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Wilson J. had in mind two “main types of
    mischief” at which the discretion might be aimed: (1) where unfairness arises
    from the manner in which evidence is obtained; and (2) where admission of the
    prior testimony impacts on the fairness of the trial. Only the latter is engaged
    in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted above, defence counsel at trial decided
    against pursuing certain lines of cross-examination based on tactical
    considerations. Wilson J. addressed this issue in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Potvin</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at p. 546:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As for the detriment an accused might suffer
    from the tactical decision of his or her counsel not to press certain issues at
    the preliminary inquiry with a witness who may subsequently become unavailable
    at trial, I am in complete agreement of the observation of Martin J.A. in <i>R.
    v. Davidson</i> [(1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.)], at p. 298:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, an accused is not deprived of
    &quot;full opportunity&quot; to cross-examine a witness at the preliminary
    hearing merely because his counsel, for tactical reasons, has conducted the
    cross-examination of a witness differently than he would have conducted the
    cross-examination at the trial, provided that there has been no improper
    restriction of the cross-examination by the provincial judge holding the
    preliminary hearing.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Wilson J., as Martin J.A. did, addressed tactical
    considerations under the rubric of a “full opportunity to cross-examine”. After </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Lewis</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, this is more
    appropriately considered under the residual discretion. But even when
    transplanted into this less rigid framework, the same result should obtain. A
    trier of fact should not be deprived of important evidence merely because
    defence counsel decided to keep his powder dry at the preliminary inquiry.
    Section 715 attempts to preserve valuable evidence that would otherwise be
    lost; it is not designed to permit counsel to second-guess tactical decisions
    made earlier in the proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In conclusion, although the trial judge decided
    the s. 715 application on a narrow basis, the record does not support the
    conclusion that the admission of E.S.’s preliminary inquiry testimony impacted
    adversely on the fairness of the trial. My conclusion is fortified by the fact
    that the appellant’s complaint is largely concerned with being deprived of the
    opportunity to cross-examine on evidence that was improperly obtained at the
    preliminary inquiry, as discussed above. </span></p>

    challenges posed in assessing the weight of E.S.’s preliminary inquiry
    testimony. This theme is evident throughout her reasons at trial. As she said, “In
    this trial, there is the added issue of whether or not the evidence of E.S.
    should be provided the weight it would have had she been present and testified

    that there were tactical reasons why defence counsel did not cross-examine E.S.
    on the inconsistencies between her statement to Constable Beck and her
    preliminary inquiry evidence. Even though she rejected this as a basis for
    dismissing the s. 715 application, the trial judge agreed that it was relevant
    to the weight to be accorded E.S.’s evidence: see </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R.

    Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2015), Mid-Trial 8-A, which provides guidance to
    the trier of fact in dealing with evidence admitted under s. 715. The key part
    of this instruction provides: “When you consider this evidence, however,
    remember that you did not see or hear this witness testify. Consider as well
    whether there is any dispute about what [the witness] said in his/her

    throughout her evidence”: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Kuzmich</span></em><i><span

    identify any other points of confusion in E.S.’s evidence, nor did counsel on
    appeal. The trial judge viewed the discrepancies identified by defence counsel
    as “relatively minor and insignificant and not sufficient to undermine the
    reliability or credibility of E.S. as to the alleged behaviour of the accused” and
    stated, “I find these inconsistencies as well as the others identified by the

lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also objects to the trial judge’s
    finding, also in para. 34, that the appellant’s testimony that he stopped when
    asked “does not ring true.” Ms. Dann submits that this finding reflects that
    the trial judge presumed the appellant’s guilt. In his factum, the appellant
    submits that, “Given that society expects reasonable individuals to respect the
    wishes of others when they withdraw their consent during sex, the trial judge’s
    criticism of the Appellant for testifying that he did exactly that was
    unreasonable.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s finding was not made in the
    abstract; nor is it undermined by resort to normative claims about good
    citizenship. The trial judge considered the appellant’s claim in light of all
    of the evidence, particularly that which she did accept, which was E.S.’s
    version of events on the critical issue of what occurred after she had
    withdrawn her consent. This was a finding that was available on the evidence:
    see </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. J.J.R.D</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA>. </span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>(2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 53.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The remaining submissions about the trial judge’s reasons focus on
    para. 33 of the trial judge’s reasons (which is reproduced, in part, in para. 70,
    above), in which the trial judge says the following:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Conversely, I did not find the evidence of the
    accused to be believable. In particular, the fact that he claimed not to be a
    supplier of marijuana to E.S. <u>His testimony on this point does not make
    sense because there was no other reason for E.S. to be in his apartment</u>.
    The accused confirmed in his evidence that he and E.S. were only acquaintances
    who saw each other in the hallway on occasion when E.S. visited his neighbour,
    Seppo. <u>That E.S. would stop at the accused's apartment on this occasion and
    without encouragement, undress, climb on the bed with a broken wrist and then
    invite the accused to have sex with her is equally not believable.</u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the last underscored part of this passage
    reflects stereotypical reasoning by the trial judge – i.e., that it is unlikely
    that a woman would initiate sex with a man in the manner described. As I read
    this passage, the trial judge was assessing the likelihood of this having
    happened in light of the trial evidence that touched on the relationship
    between the appellant and E.S. It was in this context that the trial judge
    rejected the appellant’s evidence, not because of stereotypical assumptions
    about gender roles in sexual situations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s real complaint with this paragraph is that it
    ignores what he claims was the true nature of the relationship between E.S. and
    the appellant, one that involved previous sexual contact. This is just another
    attack on the trial judge’s s. 276 ruling, which I have already addressed
    above.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I return to the critical issue at trial and on appeal – whether the
    appellant continued to penetrate E.S. without her consent, after he initially stopped
    at her request. There was no doubt that E.S. consented to sexual intercourse
    with the appellant. It is common ground that he stopped when asked. The only
    issue is whether he continued after that. Whether they had sex on previous
    occasions, or whether the appellant was more than just her supplier of
    marijuana was not helpful one way or the other in resolving this issue. The
    trial judge’s reasons are faithful to this reality of the case.</span></p>
