lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, a 26-year-old medical student, started
    a conversation in an internet chat room with “mia_aqt98” in November 2012. He asked
    for her age, sex, and location. “Mia” answered that she was a 14-year-old girl.
    Within minutes, the appellant turned the conversation explicitly sexual. They
    chatted on and off over four days, culminating in his proposal they meet up for
    sex. In reality, “Mia” was an online persona created by a Peel Regional Police
    officer as part of an investigation by the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE)
    into online child luring. When the appellant attended at an agreed meeting
    place, he was arrested. He gave a police statement shortly after speaking with
    duty counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of internet child
    luring, contrary to s. 172.1(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. He received a
    six-month custodial sentence. At the close of the trial, the appellant brought
    an application for a stay on the basis of entrapment. The application was
    denied: 2016 ONSC 5675, 342 C.C.C. (3d) 128 (“Entrapment Ruling”). He appeals
    against conviction on the bases of entrapment and a violation of his right to
    counsel under s. 10(b) of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Police Constable Hutchinson worked in the ICE
    Unit of Peel Regional Police. Her responsibilities included investigating the
    exploitation of children on the internet. Her method of investigation was to adopt
    the persona of a child and engage in chats with unknown persons online.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>PC Hutchinson created a Yahoo Messenger account with
    the username “mia_aqt98”. She testified that she chose “Mia” to indicate that
    she was female, that the abbreviation “aqt” meant “a cutie”, and that “98” suggested
    a year of birth of 1998, which at the time of the offence would have indicated an
    age of 14 years. The public profile she created, which was visible to other
    users, displayed her name as Mia Andrews, age 19, with date of birth November
    10, 1993. One of Yahoo’s conditions of use was that participants attest to
    being 18 years of age or older.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 27, 2012, when PC Hutchinson logged
    into a chat room called “Toronto Global Chat 1”, the appellant was already logged
    in. Like any other user logged in at that time, he received an automatic
    notification that mia_aqt98 had logged in and was now present in the chat room.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant initiated a private conversation,
    outside the chat room, with “hi” and “asl?”, meaning age, sex, and location. Mia_aqt98
    answered, “14”, “f” and “brampton”, meaning 14 years old, female, and living in
    Brampton.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant asked if Mia wanted to go to a
    movie, and Mia declined, saying “i dont even kno u” and “i nvr chilled wit an
    older boy b4”. The appellant volunteered that he was a medical student, with his
    own car, and living on his own. Mia asked the appellant if he saw that she was
    14. He replied “yeah yeah. thats cool” and “we can be friends”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then asked Mia why she didn’t have
    a boyfriend, whether she liked anyone from school. He then turned the
    conversation explicitly sexual, asking about her sexual experience, whether she
    masturbated. Over the next few days, he returned to the themes of masturbation
    and pornography, offered to coach her on how to masturbate, and described what
    he would like to do with her sexually. He sent her a link to a pornographic
    video of a couple engaged in intercourse, assured Mia that the woman in the
    video was “loving it”, and that in any event they would not start off with intercourse
    right away. When she expressed reticence because of her young age, he was reassuring:
    “u want for ur first time sex to be with someone older than u/ who knows what
    he is doing”. When he asked if she had told anyone about him, she said no. When
    she asked if the appellant had told anyone about her, he replied “not yet.. they
    will be all lik u r dating such a yound girl”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 29, 2012, the appellant asked to
    meet Mia, and she agreed to skip school and meet him at her apartment the next
    day. On November 30, 2012, the two had further text communications. Mia asked
    the appellant to meet at her apartment. He told her he would meet her in the
    lobby. When he texted from the lobby, police officers arrested him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After speaking with duty counsel, the appellant
    gave a police statement in which he discussed his chat conversations with Mia. In
    a pre-trial <em>voir dire</em>, the trial judge found the police statement to
    be admissible under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>, dismissing almost all of
    the appellant’s arguments that the statement was involuntary or proffered in
    breach of his rights under <em>Charter </em>ss. 10(a) and (b): [2015] O.J. No.
    7328 (S.C.) (“Statement Ruling”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the appellant acknowledged his
    participation in the chats, but claimed that he believed he was communicating
    with an adult engaged in role-playing. He testified that he had no intention of
    engaging in sexual activity with someone underage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    evidence. He was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    believed he was communicating with an underage person, and that the communication
    was for the purpose of committing sexual touching.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Entrapment Application</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Upon conviction, the appellant brought an
    entrapment application to stay proceedings. He argued that PC Hutchinson lacked
    the requisite grounds to “offer an opportunity” to commit an offence by posing
    as a 14-year-old girl. The trial judge dismissed the application on the basis
    that (1) PC Hutchinson did not “offer an opportunity” for the appellant to
    commit the offence, and (2) if there was an opportunity offered, it was made in
    the course of a <em>bona fide</em> investigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons given below, I would dismiss the
    appeal on the basis that the trial judge did not err in concluding that the
    officer did not provide an opportunity to commit an offence. It is therefore
    unnecessary to address the issue of whether there was a <em>bona fide</em> investigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence of entrapment flows from the doctrine
    of abuse of process. It is not a substantive defence to allegations of criminal
    wrongdoing, but instead allows for a conviction to be stayed where the investigative
    conduct of the police was exploitative or corrupting. As the Supreme Court
    explained in <em>R. v. Mack</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903, “[i]n certain cases the
    police conduct will be offensive because it exploits human characteristics that
    as a society we feel should be respected”: at p. 963. The court provided the
    following example of police conduct that would constitute entrapment, at p.
    963:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]f the law enforcement officer or agent appeals
    to a person’s instincts of compassion, sympathy and friendship and uses these
    qualities of a person to effect the commission of a crime, we may say this is
    not permissible conduct because it violates individual privacy and the dignity
    of interpersonal relationships, and condemns behaviour that we want to
    encourage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court recently summarized the branches of
    the entrapment doctrine in <em>R. v. Ahmad</em>, 2018 ONCA 534, 141 O.R. (3d)
    241, at para. 32, rev’d in part but not on this point, 2020 SCC 11: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Mack</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at pp. 964-65, the Supreme Court set out the two principal
    categories of entrapment. The defence is available when either:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>1) “the authorities provide a person with an
    opportunity to commit an offence without acting on a reasonable suspicion that
    this person is already engaged in criminal activity or pursuant to a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>bona fide</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> inquiry”; or</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2) “although having such a reasonable suspicion
    or acting in the course of a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>bona fide </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>inquiry, they go beyond providing an opportunity and induce the
    commission of an offence.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At para. 31 of <em>Ahmad</em>, this court
    explained the onus on the accused in an entrapment application:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[G]iven the serious nature of an entrapment
    allegation and the substantial leeway given to the state to develop techniques
    to fight crime, a finding of entrapment and a stay of proceedings should be
    granted only in the “clearest of cases”: <em>Mack</em>, at pp. 975-76. The
    accused must establish the defence on a balance of probabilities: <em>Mack</em>,
    at p. 975.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>R. v. Barnes</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449,<em> </em>the Supreme Court affirmed the “basic rule” articulated in <em>Mack</em>,
    that “the police may only present the opportunity to commit a particular crime to
    an individual who arouses a suspicion that he or she is already engaged in the
    particular criminal activity”: at p. 463. It also affirmed an exception to this
    rule where police are undertaking “a <em>bona fide</em> investigation directed
    at an area where it is reasonably suspected that criminal activity is
    occurring”: at p. 463. Where police neither have reasonable suspicion of an individual
    already engaged in crime, nor are investigating a location that is reasonably
    suspected of being a hub of criminal activity, presenting an opportunity to
    commit a particular crime amounts to random virtue testing, and is not
    permitted. The Supreme Court most recently affirmed these principles in <em>Ahmad</em>,
    in which a majority of the court held that the entrapment framework from <em>Mack</em> has “stood the test of time” and applies with full force to contexts such as
    child luring: at para. 23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this appeal, there was no allegation that the
    police acted in a way to induce the appellant to commit an offence. The
    application turned solely on the first branch: whether the police provided the
    appellant with an opportunity to commit an offence, and if so, whether the
    police were undertaking a <em>bona fide </em>investigation in an area where
    they had a reasonable suspicion that crime was occurring. It is common ground
    that the police had no individualized reasonable suspicion that the appellant himself
    was engaged in criminal activity when PC Hutchinson responded to his question
    “asl?”.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Much of the entrapment case law focuses on the
    distinction between presenting an individual with an opportunity to commit an
    offence, and merely taking a step in investigating criminal activity. The
    former is entrapment unless the police first have reasonable suspicion. The
    latter is permissible police conduct.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case law has struggled to articulate the basis
    for the distinction, preferring to make concrete factual findings about what
    has constituted an opportunity and what has not. This court recognized that the
    distinction will “sometimes be difficult to draw”: <em>R. v. Bayat</em>, 2011
    ONCA 778, 108 O.R. (3d) 420, at para. 19. One source of the difficulty is that,
    conceptually, providing an individual with an opportunity to commit an offence is,
    in a literal sense, a step in investigating criminal activity. If such a broad
    conception of “providing an opportunity” were to be adopted, the distinction
    would collapse. As one commentator has pointed out, “the mere presence of a
    plainclothes officer creates an opportunity, loosely defined, for someone to
    offer them illegal drugs and thereby commit an offence”: Brent Kettles, “The
    Entrapment Defence in Internet Child Luring Cases” (2011) 16 Can. Crim. L. Rev.
    89, at p. 91. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case law, however, has specified a narrow
    conception of “providing an opportunity,” with the analysis often focusing on
    whether the police or the accused took the initiative in the interaction and
    when: <em>Bayat</em>; <em>R. v. Imoro</em>, 2010 ONCA 122, 251 C.C.C. (3d) 131; <em>R. v. Swan</em>, 2009 BCCA 142, 244 C.C.C. (3d) 198. The narrow conception
    of “providing an opportunity” excludes investigative techniques where the originating
    criminal spark comes from the accused. </span></p>

    conversation and turns it toward the commission of an offence, the police have
    not provided the accused with an opportunity to commit the offence: Entrapment
    Ruling, at para. 54; <em>Bayat</em>, at para. 21. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge used
    an inappropriately narrow conception of providing an opportunity. The appellant
    argues that the conception of an opportunity to commit an offence from <em>Mack</em> is the mere <span class=Underline>chance</span> to commit an offence, such that
    the moment the appellant was confronted with a 14-year-old girl in a place
    where he had no reason to expect to meet a 14-year-old girl, he was provided
    with an opportunity to commit an offence. But for the presence of a 14-year-old
    girl in an adult chat room, he argues, he would not have had an opportunity to commit
    the offence of luring a 14-year-old girl.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In support of the argument for this broad
    conception of providing an opportunity, the appellant argues that on the narrower
    conception, the category of taking an investigative step would expand and the
    category of providing an opportunity would effectively disappear. The entrapment
    doctrine would collapse into inducing the offence, which is always prohibited, and
    taking an investigative step, which is generally permitted even without
    reasonable suspicion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The broad conception of “providing an

    law and conflicting with binding authority. On this basis alone, the appeal must

lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Providing an opportunity is not established by but-for
    causation – that but for the presence of the investigating officer posing as a
    14-year-old girl, the appellant would not have had the opportunity to commit
    the offence. In <em>Ahmad</em>, this court cautioned against “an overly
    technical approach to the entrapment doctrine” that detaches the doctrine from
    its purpose of preventing police investigations that offend against decency and
    fair play: at para. 39.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Ahmad</em>, the Supreme Court held that in
    order to allow the police flexibility to investigate crime, an officer’s actions
    must be “sufficiently proximate to conduct that would satisfy the elements of
    the offence” in order to constitute an opportunity: at para. 64. In this case,
    the offence was not in talking with a 14-year-old girl. The offence was communicating
    with a child for the purposes of committing an offence, such as sexual
    touching. The appellant’s argument could only succeed, it seems to me, in a
    world where any 14-year-old girl who agrees to chat on-line with an adult male in
    a general interest chat room thereby communicates that she is potentially receptive
    to a sexual encounter. That is not our world.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I do not agree that the trial judge
    committed any error. Where, as here, the police conduct is nothing other than placing
    a potential victim in an accused’s line of vision, and where the accused is
    given no reason to believe that the victim would be a willing participant in
    the offence committed, the police have not provided an opportunity to commit an
    offence. It was the appellant who initiated contact with the undercover officer
    masquerading as a 14-year-old girl. It was the appellant who sought to
    ascertain her age. Having learned that she was underage, it was the appellant
    who ventured into sexual topics and suggested an in-person meeting. Throughout
    these interactions, the undercover officer repeatedly raised the issue of the
    fictional victim’s youth, but the appellant persisted.</span></p>

    and the officer was concerned that he would not be able to track the standard
    caution. The officer advised the appellant that if he did not have his own
    lawyer (which he did not), the police would call duty counsel for him. Minutes
    later, another officer read the standard caution to the appellant, which
    informed the appellant that he could speak with any lawyer of his choosing. The

    exercise of this right by providing him with a directory. He only discovered he

    19:</span></p>

    crossed. I disagree. In my view, the officer did provide an opportunity to
    commit an offence. After all, that was the raison d’être for her presence in
    the chat room. The officer was looking for people who might approach her,
    knowing that she was underage. In considering this issue, my colleague does not
    address, nor did the trial judge, the fact of the persona that the officer
    created and presented to others in the chat room. In particular, the officer
    gave evidence that she adopted the user name “mia_aqt98” for the purpose of
    communicating to others in the chat room that she was female, that she was “a
    cutie”, and that she was 14 years old.</span></p>

    the reasons that the officer did, was an invitation or enticement to improper
    conduct. It was the digital equivalent of an undercover officer standing on a
    street corner with a sign saying “drug user”. In that situation, the undercover
    officer would be advertising to any drug dealer that she was a potential
    customer. It would clearly be offering an opportunity for a drug dealer to
    approach her for the purpose of selling her drugs. Whether one characterizes it
    as an invitation to commit an offence or an opportunity to commit an offence,
    the result is the same. It is that fact that distinguishes this case from some
    others, such as <em>Bayat </em>and <em>R. v. Imoro, </em>2010 ONCA 122, 251

    as an adult, in the normal course of her duties, with no intention to
    investigate or create a specific offence. In other words, the officer was not
    simply “walking her beat” in the chat room. If that had been the case, there
    would be no offering of an opportunity just as there would be no opportunity
    offered if a plain clothes officer was simply standing on a sidewalk and a
    person approached and offered to sell her drugs. </span></p>

    entice some contact of the very type that the appellant provided. To conclude
    that the officer was not providing an opportunity to commit an offence is
    inconsistent with her presence in the chat room and the adoption of the persona
    that she did, which she then advertised to the other participants in the chat room.
    Keep in mind, on this point, that this was not a chat room for teenagers, nor
    was it the type of chat room that teenagers would be expected to frequent. It
    was an adult-only chat room. It was also not a chat room devoted to sexual

    2016 ONSC 5675, 342 C.C.C. (3d) 128, at para. 58. The trial judge does not
    refer to any evidence in support of this conclusion and none is to be found in
    the record. Contrary to the submissions of Crown counsel at trial, the fact is
    that the officer did not offer any evidence that this chat room was a location
    suspected of child luring. It appears that the officer essentially chose this
    particular chat room at random, the only criteria being that it had to be a
    chat room where the participants were likely to be within her geographic
    jurisdiction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge relied on the decision in <em>R.
    v. Levigne</em>, 2010 SCC 25, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3, to support his conclusion on
    this point. I am unable to see how that decision assists on this issue. As
    noted by the trial judge, <em>Levigne</em> addresses the reasons behind the
    enactment of the child luring provision in the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C.,
    1985, c. C-46. While the decision does say that the provision was put in place
    to facilitate the investigation of such offences, it does not say why the
    officer was in the particular chat room in that case nor does it say, or
    suggest, that the entire Internet is so rife with criminal activity of this
    type that it provides reasonable suspicion for an investigation in every
    contour of its existence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this point, there is a clear distinction
    between an Internet chat room of the type involved here, and sites such as
    Craigslist, which have featured in other decisions involving this issue (see,
    for example, <em>R. v. Argent</em>, 2016 ONCA 129). The sexual nature of
    activities on certain portions of Craigslist is well-known. The police often
    get complaints about them. Such information can provide the reasonable
    suspicion necessary for a <em>bona fide</em> investigation. But those
    situations are different in kind than what was involved in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police were required to have a reasonable
    suspicion that child luring would be occurring within this chat room, in order
    to establish that any investigation was a <em>bona fide</em> one. This
    requirement is confirmed in <em>Ahmad</em>, where </span><span lang=EN-CA>Karakatsanis,
    Brown and Martin JJ. said, at para. 24:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This standard requires the police to disclose
    the basis for their belief and to show that they had legitimate reasons related
    to criminality for targeting an individual or the people associated with a
    location. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fact is that the police did not offer that
    evidence. Indeed, the Crown on appeal does not even suggest that the police had
    any such evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rather, the Crown proposes, and the trial judge
    appears to have accepted, that Internet chat rooms generally are locations
    where a reasonable suspicion exists with respect to the prospect of child
    luring. That broad-based approach to reasonable suspicion was rejected in <em>Barnes</em> and rejected again in <em>Ahmad</em>. Indeed, the application of the reasonable
    suspicion standard to virtual spaces was directly addressed in <em>Ahmad</em>,
    where </span><span lang=EN-CA>Karakatsanis, Brown and Martin JJ. said, at para.
    41:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We emphasize that the virtual space in
    question must be defined with sufficient precision in order to ground
    reasonable suspicion. Reviewing courts must scrutinize the evidence that
    prompted the inquiry to ensure the police have narrowed their scope so that the
    purview of their inquiry is no broader than the evidence allows.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>And further, at para. 43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, entire websites or social media
    platforms will rarely, if ever, be sufficiently particularized to support
    reasonable suspicion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is clear, in my view, that the officer in
    this case was engaged in random virtue testing, as that concept is properly
    understood. It is akin to the situation referred to in<em> Barnes</em>, where
    Lamer C.J. said, at p. 462:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I note that in many cases, the size of the
    area itself may indicate that the investigation is not <em>bona fide</em>. This
    will be so particularly when there are grounds for believing that the criminal
    activity being investigated is concentrated in part of a larger area targeted
    by the police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the situation in <em>Barnes </em>dealt
    with a geographic area in the City of Vancouver, it serves up the same problem
    if one considers the Internet as a geographic area. Just because criminal
    activity may occur in one part of the Internet does not justify the police
    entering any area to conduct an investigation, just as the fact that drug
    activity took place in the Granville Mall area of Vancouver would not have
    justified an investigation outside of that specific area. The police must have
    evidence specific to the area that they are going to investigate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I have already pointed out, there are parts
    of the Internet that are reasonably suspected of being misused for criminal
    purposes. Craigslist is the example to which I referred, but there are others. The
    police did not offer any evidence that it is problematic to separately deal
    with the component parts of the Internet for investigative purposes. Yet their
    approach in this case relies on a blanket of suspicion over the entire
    Internet.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not the role of the police to randomly
    offer members of the public the chance to commit an offence and then see who
    does. The problem with random virtue testing, as identified in <em>Mack, </em>presents
    itself in this very case. It was described by Lamer J., at p. 965:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The absence of a reasonable suspicion or a <em>bona
    fide</em> inquiry is significant in assessing the police conduct because of the
    risk that the police will attract people who would not otherwise have any
    involvement in a crime and because it is not a proper use of the police power
    to simply go out and test the virtue of people on a random basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One has to wonder whether there is any reason to
    believe that the appellant would have become involved in this crime, but for
    the officer’s actions in this case. It is this reality that provides the reason
    why the police are prohibited from engaging in random virtue testing “because
    it ‘prey[s] on the weakness of human nature’ to entice individuals into
    offending”: <em>Ahmad</em>, at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In that regard, one must not lose sight of the
    fact that the Internet now provides a place for social exchange and interaction
    that might previously have been provided only by bars, social clubs, or other
    physical events and locations. As McLachlin C.J. observed in <em>R. v. Marakah</em>,
    2017 SCC 59, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 608, at para. 28:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The millions of us who text friends, family,
    and acquaintances may each be viewed as having appropriated a corner of this
    electronic space for our own purposes. There, we seclude ourselves and convey
    our private messages, just as we might use a room in a home or an office to
    talk behind closed doors. The phrase “chat room” to describe an Internet site
    through which people communicate is not merely a metaphor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As this observation makes clear, the actions of
    the police in a chat room engage privacy concerns. People who participate in
    private conversations on the Internet are entitled to expect that the police
    will not be surveilling their conversations, including instigating or
    participating in them for investigative purposes not based on a reasonable
    suspicion of criminal activity. This point was also made in <em>Ahmad</em> where
    Karakatsanis, Brown and Martin JJ. said, at para. 38:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Section 8 jurisprudence recognizes that at the
    “heart of liberty in a modern state” is the need to “set a premium” on the
    ability of its citizens to carve out spaces in their lives, sanctuaries where they
    may interact freely, unhindered by the possibility of encounters with the state.

    nature of the offence to distort the application of the entrapment doctrine.
    Its application does not depend on the nature of the offence, or its
    seriousness, or the fact that the offence may be difficult to investigate. The
    fact that the appellant engaged in the conduct at issue cannot impact the
    conclusion regarding the application of the entrapment doctrine. As Lamer J.
    made clear in <em>Mack</em>, at p. 951, culpability is not the basis for the
    application of the doctrine. In considering entrapment, we look at the actions
    of the police, not of the accused. </span></p>
