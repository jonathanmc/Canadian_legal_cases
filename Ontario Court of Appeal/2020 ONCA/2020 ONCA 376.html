  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=Heading>INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This appeal concerns the interpretation of a municipal by-law, and in
    particular, the Town of Grimsby Zoning By-law 14-45 (the “By-law”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, 2222868 Ontario Inc. (“2222”), purchased a 119-acre
    property (the “property”) located in the Town of Grimsby on March 30, 2018,
    after reviewing zoning and permitted uses. The property is adjacent to a
    private regional airport that is on the same parcel of land as that of 2222. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2222 proposed to operate a works yard to store construction machinery
    for a private company. It unsuccessfully applied for site plan approval to
    permit a “Works Yard”, as that term is defined in the By-law, on part of its
    property. It maintained that its proposed Works Yard was a permitted use in the
    Zone designated as the “Utility Zone” in the By-law. The appellant, the Town of
    Grimsby (the “Town”), took the position that the proposed use did not comply
    with its By-law, stating: “…the use of the subject lands for a works yard for a
    private company which does not deliver a public or quasi-public utility is not
    intended in the terminology contained in either the Zoning By-law or the
    Official Plan.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2222 brought an application for a determination that a private Works
    Yard is included as a permitted use in the By-law. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge granted the application and subsequently ordered
    costs of $40,000 on a partial indemnity scale in favour of 2222. The Town
    appeals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal. The application judge correctly concluded that the By-law permits the
    use proposed by 2222</span>.</p>
  <p class=Heading>FACTS</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The By-law</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Town passed the By-law on May 20, 2014. The By-law states that it is
    in conformity with the Official Plan of the Town that was approved by the
    Ontario Municipal Board under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Planning Act</span></em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13. The stated purpose of the By-law is to regulate the use
    of land, buildings and structures, to regulate the construction and alteration
    of buildings and structures, and to implement the policies of the Town’s
    Official Plan. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The By-law creates numerous Zones, three of which are Employment Zones:
    the General Employment Zone; the Prestige Employment Zone; and, at issue in
    this appeal, the Utility Zone. “Utility” is not a defined term in the By-law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 10 of the By-law describes the permitted uses within each Employment
    Zone. The Utility Zone has four permitted uses: Airport; Utility Corridor;
    Water and Sewage Treatment, Pumping and Storage Facility; and Works Yard.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Works
    Yard is defined as “a facility for the storage and repair of machinery,
    vehicles and equipment.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    By-law provides that where a use is defined, it shall not be interpreted to
    include any other defined use unless it is stated in the definition to the
    contrary: s. 2.5.7. Italicized words in the By-law are to provide clarity and
    to ensure that the By-law and its intent are applied consistently.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    permitted uses have qualifications. For example, in the Prestige Employment
    Zone, “Professional and Administrative Office” is a permitted use but “Restaurant”
    is noted as an “Accessory use” to that Office use. Accessory use is defined in
    the By-law as “a <i>use</i> naturally and normally incidental to, subordinate
    to or exclusively devoted to a principal <em><span lang=EN-CA>use</span></em> and located on the same <em><span lang=EN-CA>lot</span></em>”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    Accessory uses are identified in the Utility Zone. Accordingly, Works Yard is a
    stand-alone use. A Works Yard Permitted Use is not found elsewhere in the
    By-law.</p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Official Plan</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Town’s Official Plan received final approval on May 12, 2012. Pursuant to s.
    24(1) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Planning Act</span></em>, no by-law shall be
    passed that does not conform to an Official Plan that is in effect.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 24(4) of the <a name="_Hlk39584947"><em><span lang=EN-CA>Planning Act</span></em></a>,
    zoning by-laws are deemed conclusively to conform with an Official Plan where
    there is no outstanding appeal or appeal periods applicable to the relevant
    provisions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, neither party suggested that there is any outstanding appeal or
    appeal periods relating to the Town’s Official Plan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>2222’s property is located in the “Utility Area” designation of
    the Town’s Official Plan. Utility is defined in the Official Plan as “all
    public and/or private utilities, including but not limited to licensed
    broadcasting,…a water supply, storm or sanitary sewage…or any other similar
    works or systems necessary to the public interest.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3.9 of the Official Plan describes the “Intent”, “Objectives” and “Permitted
    Uses” of the Utility Area. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the heading “Intent”, the Official Plan states that the Utility Area recognizes
    the existing water treatment plant and pollution control plant and other public
    and private utilities. The “Objective” is to “ensure that utilities are located
    in a manner that maximizes their performance while limiting any land use
    incompatibilities.” Lastly, the “Permitted Uses” within the Utility Area
    designation “shall <span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>include</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> </span>[p]ublic and quasi-public <em><span lang=EN-CA>utility</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> </span>uses of Town-wide or regional significance including
    existing sewage and water treatment facilities, existing pumping stations,
    airport use, and transmission towers” (underline emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the application judge observed, the Official Plan uses language of inclusion in
    the Permitted Uses designation, not prohibition. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Town states that as a portion of the parcel of land was used for a regional
    airport, 2222’s property was designated as a “Utility Area” in the Official
    Plan.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Policy Statement and the Greenbelt Plan</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 3 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Planning Act</span></em>, the Province may
    issue Policy Statements on municipal planning. The Provincial Policy Statement
    states that the Official Plan is the most important vehicle for implementation
    of the Provincial Policy Statement.<a name="_Hlk39250057"> Decisions of the
    municipal council shall be consistent with the Policy Statements. </a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, the Provincial Policy Statement addresses the provincial
    interest in transportation and infrastructure corridors. An airport is treated
    as infrastructure, which also includes transit and transportation corridors and
    facilities. Planning authorities are to plan for and protect corridors and
    rights-of-way for infrastructure, including transportation, transit and
    electricity generation facilities, and transmission systems to meet current and
    future needs. According to the Provincial Policy Statement: “Planning
    authorities shall not permit <em><span lang=EN-CA>development</span></em> in <em><span
lang=EN-CA>planned corridors</span></em> that could preclude or negatively
    affect the use of the corridor for the purpose(s) for which it was identified” and
    “Planning for land uses in the vicinity of <em><span lang=EN-CA>airports</span></em>…shall
    be undertaken so that:…their long-term operation and economic role is protected…”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ontario Government has established a Greenbelt Area for which it has a
    Greenbelt Plan. Pursuant to s. 7 of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Greenbelt Act</span></em>, <i>2005</i>, S.O. 2005, c.1, a decision made under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Planning
    Act</span></em> or in relation to a prescribed matter by a municipal council
    shall conform with the Greenbelt Plan and no municipality shall pass a by-law
    that conflicts with the Greenbelt Plan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Town states that 2222’s lands are located in a “Specialty Crop Area” within the
    “Protected Countryside” designation under the Greenbelt Plan, and that with
    certain permitted exceptions such as Infrastructure, a Specialty Crop Area is
    for agricultural use. </p>
  <p class=Heading>APPLICATION JUDGE’S REASONS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As
    mentioned, the application judge granted 2222’s application and declared that a
    private works yard is a permitted use for the Utility Zone in the By-law. She
    rejected the Town’s argument that “use” must support or be limited to a
    utility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge considered the contents of the Official Plan and went on to
    note that it speaks of what shall be included in Utility Areas, but does not
    prohibit non-public or quasi-public uses. Moreover, there was no evidence or
    argument that the proposed construction equipment storage use is incompatible
    with the land use objectives. She noted that permitted use does not take its
    context from the name of the zone. For example, “Agricultural use” is permitted
    in the Prestige Employment Zone.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    the Town failed to link all uses in the Utility Zone to public or quasi-public
    uses, which it could have done with a qualification or an accessory use
    designation, as seen elsewhere in the zoning tables included in the By-law. The
    application judge concluded that the Town’s proposed narrow public uses
    interpretation was not intended; the By-law was unambiguous and clearly-stated.
    As such, there was no need to consult the Provincial Policy Statement or the
    Greenbelt Plan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge applied this court’s decision in <a name="_Hlk39573157"><em><span
lang=EN-CA>St. Mary's Cement Inc. (Canada) v. Clarington (Municipality)</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, 2012 ONCA 884, 299 O.A.C. 357, </span></em></a>at
    para. 17:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><a name="_Hlk39249395">The modern principles of statutory
    interpretation apply equally to the interpretation of a municipal by-law and a
    statute [citation omitted]. Thus, the interpretation of a by-law involves
    consideration of the text of the by-law, the intent of municipal council, and
    the purpose and scheme of the by-law as a whole…</a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    application judge concluded her analysis as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The plain language of the by-law permits the use sought by the
    applicant. The by-law did not qualify the use to be for a public purpose. The
    by-law defined “Works Yard” without any restriction to a public use. The zone

  <p class=Heading>ANALYSIS</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is helpful to first set forth the legal principles applicable to the
    interpretation of a by-law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The interpretation of a by-law is a question of law, reviewable
    on a correctness standard: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Sarnia (City) v. River City
    Vineyard Christian Fellowship of Sarnia</span></em>, 2015 ONCA 494, 336 O.A.C.
    373, at para. 22.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A zoning by-law is the end-product in law of the planning process
    legislated by <em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>the</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA> Planning Act</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:
normal'>:</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA> Rotstein v. Oro-Medonte (Township)</span></em>,
    2002 CarswellOnt 4411 (S.C.), at para. 22.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The modern principles of statutory interpretation apply equally
    to the interpretation of a municipal by-law and statute. Thus, the
    interpretation of a by-law involves consideration of the text of the by-law,
    the intent of municipal council, and the purpose and scheme of the by-law as a
    whole: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Clarington</span></em>, at para. 17.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Official Plans are not statutes: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Bele
    Himmell Investments Ltd. v. Mississauga (City)</span></em>, 1982 CarswellOnt
    1946 (Div. Ct.), at para. 22. The purpose of an Official Plan is to set out a
    framework of “goals, objectives and policies”. It establishes the broad
    principles that are to govern the municipality’s land use planning generally: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Goldlist Properties Inc. v. Toronto (City)</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, 232 D.L.R. (4th) 298 (Ont. C.A.)</span></em>,
    at para. 49.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As by-laws are the means by which Official Plans are implemented,
    the terms of an Official Plan aid in the contextual interpretation of the
    by-law: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Clarington</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under the<i> <em><span lang=EN-CA>Building Code Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 1992</span></i><span lang=EN-CA>, S.O. 1992, c. 23,<i> </i></span>an
    applicant for a building permit must be in compliance with the applicable
    By-law. Unambiguous by-laws provide clarity to the Chief Building Official and
    to a landowner.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    this case, the application judge identified and applied the correct test. She
    examined the Zone and the Permitted Uses contained in the By-law. Works Yard
    was specifically and unambiguously defined in the By-law. A Works Yard was
    identified as a separate Permitted Use and not as an Accessory Use. Had the
    Town intended to link Works Yard to utility use or to public or quasi-public
    uses, it could have done so by including a Qualification or Accessory use
    designation in the By-law as it did for other uses. Instead, the Town opted not
    to do so.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the name of a Zone did not dictate a Permitted Use; this was not the scheme of
    the By-law. For example, as the application judge observed, Agricultural Use
    was permitted in the Prestige Employment Zone.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    mentioned, under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Planning Act</span></em>, zoning
    by-laws are deemed conclusively to conform with an Official Plan in the absence
    of an appeal or appeal period applicable to the relevant provision. Neither
    party in this case suggested that there was an outstanding appeal or appeal
    period. The application judge nonetheless did consider the Official Plan in her
    interpretation of the By-law. She fairly reasoned that it used language of
    inclusion rather than prohibition within the Permitted Uses designation of the
    Utility area. In addition, she noted that the objective of the designation in
    the Official Plan was to “ensure that Utilities are located in a manner that
    maximizes their performance while limiting land use incompatibilities.” A Works
    Yard was compatible with the uses enumerated in the Utility Area designation of
    the Official Plan.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, I need not comment further on the Provincial Policy
    Statement or the Greenbelt Plan. I would note, however, that the appellant was
    unable to direct the court to any authority reflecting a requirement to have
    recourse to these documents when interpreting a by-law. Furthermore, in oral
    argument, the appellant acknowledged that while it was open to the application
    judge to look at these documents, she was not required to do so. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also note that, as mentioned, Works Yard is not found as a Permitted Use elsewhere
    in the By-law. If one were to accept the appellant’s proposed interpretation, a
    Works Yard unconnected to a utility would be prohibited anywhere in the Town,
    surely an unintended result. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, the interpretation of Works Yard in the By-law permitted the use
    advocated by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    I see no error in the application judge’s statement that there was no evidence
    or argument that the proposed land use of storing construction equipment was in
    any way incompatible with the land use objectives. This was not the drawing of
    an adverse inference; it was simply a statement of fact. </p>
  <p class=Heading>DISPOSITION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs of the appeal fixed in the
    amount of $21,700 on a partial indemnity scale inclusive of disbursements and
    applicable tax to be paid by the Town to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I see no basis on which to interfere with the application judge’s
    discretionary award of $40,000 in favour of the respondent for costs of the
    application.</p>
