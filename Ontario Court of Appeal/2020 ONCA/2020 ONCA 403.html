  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Zarnett J.A.: </span></strong></p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>INTRODUCTION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants, Jon-Paul Fuller (“Fuller”) and
    his personal company, JPF Komon Kaisha Inc. (“JPF”) sought, by application,
    damages for the failure of the respondent, Aphria Inc. (“Aphria”), to honour
    options to acquire Aphria common shares (the “Options”). The appellants claimed
    that the Options, granted to JPF in a Consulting Agreement dated June 2, 2014, and
    confirmed in a subsequently-executed Stock Option Agreement, were specified to
    have an exercise period of five years—continuing into 2019—even though the Consulting
    Agreement itself had a two-year term that expired in June 2016. The appellants
    claimed that Aphria breached its contractual obligations when it rejected the
    appellants’ exercise of the Options in December 2017 as out of time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application was dismissed. The application
    judge agreed with Aphria’s position that the Options had ceased to be
    exercisable before they were exercised. He held that the Options were subject
    to a Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plan”) that was incorporated by reference into
    the Consulting Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement. He gave effect to a term
    of the Option Plan that provided that any options held by a consultant cease to
    be exercisable six months after the consulting arrangement ends, rather than a
    provision, in both the Consulting Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement, that
    the Options had a five-year exercise period. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge refused to grant the
    appellants’ alternative claim for relief from forfeiture in the event the Options
    were found to have been exercised late. He found that discretionary equitable
    relief was unavailable as Fuller had breached a Non-Competition Agreement with
    Aphria. He assessed JPF’s loss from being deprived of the benefit of the Options
    at $2,820,000, but based on his primary findings, did not award any damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants argue that the application judge
    erred in his interpretation of the relevant agreements that governed the Options.
    They also argue that, even if the Options were exercised late, relief from
    forfeiture should have been granted. If successful on either of these grounds, they
    argue that the application judge erred in not assessing and awarding damages in
    the amount of $4,480,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> For the reasons that follow, I conclude that
    the application judge erred in his interpretation of the agreements in a manner
    that justifies appellate intervention.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When properly interpreted, the agreements
    provide that the applicable exercise period is the one that was specified when
    the Options were granted by the Consulting Agreement. By the terms of the
    Option Plan, the provision in it relied on by Aphria is inapplicable where, as
    here, it is wholly inconsistent with the exercise period set in the original
    grant of the Options. As a result, the Options had not expired before they were
    exercised, and Aphria was not justified in rejecting their exercise as late. In
    light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with the issue of whether relief
    from forfeiture should have been granted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not interfere with the application
    judge’s assessment of damages; he made no reversible error in that determination.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal to the
    extent of ordering that JPF recover damages from Aphria in the amount of
    $2,820,000, for Aphria’s failure to honour the exercise of the Options.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The dispute between the parties arose out of the
    business relationship between Fuller and JPF, on the one hand, and Aphria on
    the other. Aphria was formerly known as Pure Natures Wellness Inc.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Aphria was formed in 2012 as a medical
    marihuana business venture. Fuller was one of Aphria’s three founders. During Aphria’s
    formative period, while it was seeking required licences for a medical
    marihuana business from Health Canada, Fuller held 20% of its shares. He also
    served as Aphria’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and in other roles required
    by Health Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> By the spring of 2014, Aphria had obtained one of
    the licences required for its business and was expecting the imminent receipt
    of another (the “Final Licence”). Aphria began working toward becoming a
    publicly-traded corporation. The majority owners were of the view that a new
    CEO was necessary for that to occur. This was the impetus for a negotiated
    change to Aphria’s relationship with Fuller, which both parties referred to as Fuller’s
    “exit” from Aphria. The terms of the exit were reflected in three agreements
    dated June 2, 2014: a Share Purchase Agreement, a Consulting Agreement, and a
    Non-Competition Agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Under the Share Purchase Agreement, Fuller sold
    his 20% shareholding in Aphria to the other co-founders for $3 million. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the Non-Competition Agreement, Fuller agreed
    that he would not, for a period of two years, carry on, engage in, or have any
    financial or other interest, directly or indirectly, in any activity in North
    America in competition with the business of Aphria. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the Consulting Agreement, JPF and Fuller
    agreed to provide consulting services to Aphria for a term of two years. This included
    assisting Aphria in obtaining the Final License and, if requested, assisting in
    other tasks related to the process of going public. As part of the consideration
    for agreeing to do so,  JPF was granted the Options, namely, 200,000 options to
    purchase common shares in Aphria. The provisions of the Consulting Agreement relating
    to these Options are central to the disposition of this appeal. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Consulting Agreement’s Grant of Options</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Schedule 2.2 to the Consulting Agreement, titled
    “Consulting Fees”, provided that the compensation for the appellants’
    consulting services included a grant to JPF of 200,000 Options to purchase
    common shares of Aphria at $0.60 per share. The Options were to issue
    immediately upon Aphria’s receipt of the Final Licence. The Options had an
    expiry date that was to be five years after Aphria completed the contemplated
    transaction (known as the “RTO”) that would result in it becoming a public
    issuer. After describing the Options this way, Schedule 2.2 went on to state
    that the Options “shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any option
    plan implemented by [Aphria]”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Consulting Agreement provided, in Section 4.1,
    that unless terminated in accordance with Section 4.2, the term of the
    Consulting Agreement would be two years, so that it would end on June 2, 2016. The
    Consulting Agreement contained no provision for the renewal or extension of its
    two-year term.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 4.2 of the Consulting Agreement provided
    for certain events that could result in a shortening of the term of the
    Consulting Agreement, that is, in a termination before the end of the two-year
    term. The parties could mutually agree to end the Consulting Agreement; Aphria
    could terminate it without notice for certain breaches or failures of
    performance by the appellants; and JPF could terminate it on 60 days’ written
    notice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 4.3 of the Consulting Agreement provided
    that, in the event of an early termination of the Consulting Agreement under
    Section 4.2, all unexercised options were immediately cancelled and “of no
    force and effect”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 4.3 of the Consulting Agreement only
    applied in the event of an early termination of the Consulting Agreement. Nothing
    in the Consulting Agreement provided for the cancellation of the Options upon,
    or tied in any way to, the expiry of the two-year term under Section 4.1 of the
    Consulting Agreement.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The RTO, The Final Licence, and the Option Plan</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 1 and 2, 2014, three events occurred
    that were contemplated by the grant of the Options in the Consulting Agreement.
    On December 1, the RTO was completed, which started the five-year term of the Options
    described in the Consulting Agreement. Also, on December 1, Aphria implemented
    an Option Plan. On December 2, Aphria received its Final Licence, resulting in
    the issuance (which the parties and application judge treated as synonymous
    with the vesting) of the Options.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The provisions of the Option Plan are also

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Option Plan described its purpose as advancing
    the interests of Aphria in a number of ways: by providing Eligible Persons
    (directors, officers, employees or consultants) with additional incentive; by encouraging
    Eligible Persons’ stock ownership and their interest in the success of, and
    desire to remain with, Aphria; and by attracting new directors, officers and
    employees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Option Plan gave Aphria’s Board of Directors
    the power to administer and operate the Option Plan, as well as the power to
    grant options under it and provide for their exercise. It provided for the
    Board to be able to amend the Option Plan without shareholder approval for
    certain matters and with shareholder approval for other matters. It allowed the
    Board to delegate matters pertaining to the Option Plan to a Committee or an
    individual Board member, all of whom would be the Board for the purposes of the
    Option Plan.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Option Plan provided that the securities
    that could be acquired under the Option Plan were common shares of Aphria. It limited
    the total number of shares that could be acquired and prescribed what would
    occur if there were a change in the number of common shares because of a stock
    dividend, split, or other corporate change. Among other things, it dealt with
    regulatory compliance, tax withholdings, and how Aphria would use the payments

    the Options as having been granted on June 2, 2014 and having an “Expiry Date”
    five years after that date, namely June 2, 2019. It provided a form of notice

    refusal to honour the exercise of the Options, a refusal that deprived JPF of the
    opportunity to sell the shares it would have acquired. They asserted that the
    exercise of the Options on December 6, 2017 was timely, as the Options were
    granted for a five-year term and could be exercised well into 2019.</span></p>

    in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <em>Sattva Capital Corp. v.
    Creston Moly Corp.</em>, 2014 SCC 53, [2014] 2 S.C.R. 633, and this court’s

    related contracts principle, citing <em>Salah v. Timothy's Coffees of the World
    Inc.</em>, 2010 ONCA 673, 268 O.A.C. 279, at para. 16, for the proposition that
    where more than one contract is entered into as part of an overall transaction,
    the contracts must be read in light of each other to achieve interpretive
    accuracy and give effect to the parties’ intentions. After citing that principle,
    the application judge stated that the Consulting Agreement, Option Plan, and
    Stock Option Agreement are “connected, inter-related instruments” to be interpreted
    in light of each other. He then stated that the interrelationship here was achieved
    through the technique of incorporation by reference, which guides the
    interpretation, citing <em>Invescor Restaurants Inc. v. 3574423 Canada Inc.</em>,
    2012 ONCA 387, 292 O.A.C. 322, at para. 19.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Noting that the Consulting Agreement said that
    the Options would be subject to the Option Plan, and that the Stock Option
    Agreement stated that the Options had been granted subject to the terms of the
    Option Plan, the application judge concluded that the grant of Options in the Consulting
    Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement incorporated by reference the terms
    and conditions of the Option Plan: at paras. 41, 44 and 47. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge found that Section 2.3(g)(iv)
    of the Option Plan applied to the Options. As noted above, Section 2.3(g)(iv) provided
    that options cease to be exercisable six months after a person ceases to be an
    Eligible Person “for any reason” other than a reason referred to in Section
    2.3(i) to (iii) of the Option Plan, (none of which were germane here). Since the
    appellants ceased to be Eligible Persons upon the expiry of the term of the
    Consulting Agreement, the Options ceased to be exercisable on December 2, 2016:
    at paras. 48-49 and 56. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge rejected the argument that
    the Consulting Agreement or the Stock Option Agreement represented an exercise
    by the Board of its power under the Option Plan to grant options exercisable at
    any time within their five-year term or to alter the period within which Section
    2.3(g)(iv) of the Option Plan said they could be exercised: at paras. 50-55. According
    to the application judge, Aphria therefore did not breach its contract with the
    appellants when it rejected the exercise of the Options: at para. 56.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge also rejected the argument
    that the appellants should be granted relief from forfeiture arising from a
    late exercise of the Options. In April 2016, when the corporation of which
    Fuller was sole director and president rented a greenhouse facility to a tenant
    who intended to use it to produce medical marihuana, he was still subject to
    the Non-Competition Agreement (which ran until June 2016). Although the
    arrangements with the tenant specified that the landlord had no interest in the
    plants or products to be produced by the tenant, the application judge
    concluded that Fuller’s conduct was a breach of the Non-Competition Agreement.
    That meant that Fuller lacked “clean hands” and the appellants could not obtain
    equitable relief: at paras. 68-73.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge doubted whether, even if
    he had found a breach of contract, he could award damages on an application. He
    went on, however, to assess the damages. He expressed “serious concerns” about Fuller’s
    evidence that he would have caused the shares to be sold “around the peak of
    the market”. The application judge observed that, contrary to what the
    appellants’ expert’s calculation of damages assumed, it would be unrealistic to
    expect that a person would have the foresight to sell at the peak of the market.
    He accepted the approach that Aphria submitted, namely, that JPF’s losses should
    be assessed at $2,820,000 “based on the medium share price from the purported exercise
    date to the commencement of the application of $14.70 a share, less the
    exercise price”: at paras. 81-82. </span></p>

    issue of whether the Options had expired at the time of their exercise is a
    question of contractual interpretation. The interpretation of a non-standard
    form contract by a judge at first instance is generally subject to a deferential
    standard of review on appeal, as it involves matters of mixed fact and law: <em>Sattva</em>,
    at paras. 50-52. It is “an exercise in which the principles of contractual
    interpretation are applied to the words of the written contract, considered in

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    interpretation give rise to extricable questions of law, deference will not be
    owed. Such legal errors include the application of an incorrect principle, the
    failure to consider a required element of a legal test, or a failure to
    consider a relevant factor: <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 53. Appellate courts should
    be cautious before characterizing something as an extricable question of law in
    disputes over contractual interpretation: <em>Sattva</em>, at para. 54. Nevertheless,
    the failure to apply the appropriate principles of contractual interpretation,
    especially where it results in an interpretation inconsistent with the wording of
    the relevant provisions, can give rise to an extricable error of law and
    displace deference: <em>MacDonald v. Chicago Title Insurance Company of Canada</em>,

    interpretation of the scope of a contractual indemnity: <em>Resolute FP</em>,
    at para. 26. Laskin J.A. found the following errors to justify appellate
    intervention: palpable and overriding errors of fact that affect the
    interpretation; a failure to properly, accurately, and fully consider the
    context in which a contract was made, which is an error of law; and a failure
    to consider the contract as a whole, by focussing on one provision without giving
    proper consideration to other relevant provisions, which is also an error of
    law: <em>Weyerhaeuser</em>, at para. 211 (Laskin J.A. dissenting reasons); <em>Resolute

    exercisable more than six months after an option holder ceases to be an Eligible
    Person (a term that includes a consultant) for any reason other than resignation,
    death, or termination for cause. Aphria maintains that this provision applies when
    a consulting arrangement ends due to the expiry of its defined term. As the
    consulting arrangement here had a two-year term that ended in June 2016, this
    provision means that the December 2017 exercise, even though within five years

    by treating a term of the incorporated document as prevailing in the event of
    an inconsistency. Second, the appellants argue that the application judge erred
    in failing to find that the Consulting Agreement and the Stock Option

    principles of contractual interpretation to discern which term the parties intended
    apply to the situation at issue, and which term ought to be read in such a way as
    to be inapplicable, thereby removing the apparent inconsistency. As the Supreme

    simply assert that the incorporated terms are automatically subordinate whenever

    and the Stock Option Agreement’s confirmation of the terms of that grant, were
    both “subject to” the Option Plan, on the question of the exercise period, the Option
    Plan referred back to the terms of the grant and gave priority to those terms
    over any in Section 2.3(g). The terms on which the appellants’ Options were
    granted, as they pertained to the exercise period, are entirely inconsistent
    with the application of Section 2.3(g)(iv). The Option Plan itself requires in

    when an option is granted, set a period during which the option could be
    exercised that is different than that in Section 2.3(g), including 2.3(g)(iv). When

    on whether the Board had altered the terms of the Options or the Option Plan to
    make Section 2.3(g)(iv) inapplicable, asking the question this way puts the
    cart before the horse. The correct starting point for the inquiry is not a
    search for some separate Board action altering terms, but the terms of the
    grant of the Options themselves. This is the inquiry required under Section 2.3(a)
    of the Option Plan. Only a consideration of those terms can answer the question
    before us—whether the exercise period that was specified when the Options were

    Options in the Consulting Agreement could not make Section 2.3(g)(iv) of the
    Option Plan inapplicable  because the latter did not exist when the Consulting
    Agreement was made. I do not accept that argument. The Options in this case
    must be treated as having been validly granted, as contemplated by Section
    2.3(a) of the Option Plan, even if their grant pre-dated the Option Plan. The
    parties’ agreement, that the Options were subject to the Option Plan, can only
    make sense if the grant of the Options is treated as having been made as contemplated
    by the Option Plan. Indeed, the Stock Option Agreement expressly described the Options
    as having been granted “under” the Option Plan. Under the Option Plan, it is
    the Board that grants options. The parties must be taken to have agreed that
    the Options were granted by the Board, the only body that could have granted them.

    that the first consideration in determining the exercise period of options is
    to look at what the exercise period was when the options were granted, a consideration
    of all of the terms of the grant is required. Interpreting a contract requires that
    it be read as a whole: <em>Ventas</em>, at para. 24(a). Here, the purpose of
    considering the terms of the appellants’ Options is to determine whether they
    were consistent with the operation of Section 2.3(g)(iv), or so inconsistent
    with Section 2.3(g)(iv) that giving priority to the exercise period set at the
    time of the grant necessarily requires Section 2.3(g)(iv) to be inapplicable.</span></p>

    judge failed to consider all of the terms of the grant of the Options and the period
    for exercising them, which was required by Section 2.3(a) of the Option Plan. Accordingly,
    his conclusion that they did not oust the operation of Section 2.3(g)(iv) was tainted
    by an error of law: <em>Weyerhaeuser</em>, at para. 211 (Laskin J.A. dissenting

    2.2 described them as having an expiry date that was five years after a transaction
    by which Aphria would become a public company. There could be scenarios where allowing
    a provision like Section 2.3(g)(iv) to operate would not render a five-year
    term devoid of meaning (if, for example, the Consulting Agreement itself had a
    term of five years or more, or if all the circumstances under which it could
    end before five years were future uncertain events). But that is not this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s analysis did not
    consider that the Consulting Agreement, under Section 4.1, had a two-year
    non-renewable term. That the Consulting Agreement would come to an end after
    two years, at the latest, was a certain event. The five-year expiry date of the
    Options set by the Consulting Agreement created an exercise period that would
    last more than three years after the end of the two-year non-renewable term of
    the Consulting Agreement. That exercise period is completely inconsistent with
    a provision like Section 2.3(g)(iv), which shortens the exercise period to, at
    the most, six months after the end of the Consulting Agreement. Since the end
    of the Consulting Agreement by June 2, 2016, at the latest, was certain to
    occur, the exercise period set at the time of the grant of the Options could
    never apply if Section 2.3(g)(iv) applied. That would give Section 2.3(g)(iv)
    priority over the exercise period set under Section 2.3(a), which is exactly
    the opposite of what the Option Plan provides.</span></p>

    consider that the Consulting Agreement contained a comprehensive code as to
    when the exercise period would be shortened from its five-year term. Section
    4.2 provided that the Consulting Agreement could be terminated before the end
    of two years: by mutual agreement, by Aphria in the event of certain breaches
    by the appellants; or by JPF on 60 days’ notice. Section 4.3 provided that, in
    the event of such an early termination under Section 4.2, the exercise period
    for the Options would end; the Options would be of no force or effect. However,
    neither Section 4.3, nor anything else in the Consulting Agreement provided
    that the expiry of the Consulting Agreement would have an effect on the
    exercise period of the Options in the absence of an early termination under
    Section 4.2. Although the application judge made brief  reference to these
    provisions, he did so only on the relief from forfeiture issue, not in relation
    to the proper interpretation of the exercise period of the Options.</span></p>

    were granted and taken as a whole—necessarily excludes the operation of Section
    2.3(g)(iv). The terms of the grant contain a detailed code as to the five-year length
    of the exercise period and as to when the termination of the Consulting
    Agreement would effect a shortening of that period. That code omitted the
    expiry of the two-year term from the events that would shorten the exercise
    period. In doing so, it left no room for a provision like Section 2.3(g)(iv) to
    shorten the exercise period to six months after the expiry of the two-year term
    of the Consulting Agreement, as that would contradict the terms of the grant. It
    bears repeating that under the Option Plan, specifically Section 2.3(a), the
    terms of the grant as to the length of the exercise period take priority over what
    Section 2.3(g) would otherwise provide. </span></p>

    buttress his rejection of Fuller’s suggestion that he had not read the Option

    Option Agreement, after reciting the date of the grant as the date of the
    Consulting Agreement, and defining the Expiry Date as being in 2019, provided that
    the Options could be exercised at any time up to that Expiry Date in 2019. If
    Section 2.3(g)(iv) of the Option Plan applied, the Options could never have
    been exercised at any time up to an Expiry Date in 2019. They could never have
    been exercised more than six months after the date that the non-renewable two-year
    term of the Consulting Agreement would expire in June 2016. The application

    question of whether the Options were subject to Section 2.3(g)(iv), in light of
    the exercise period that had been determined when the Options were granted. It
    therefore did not justify ignoring the actual language the parties used when
    the Options were created, or in the case of the Stock Option Agreement, after
    the Option Plan had been implemented, to define the period during which the Options
    were exercisable. That description was only consistent with excluding the

    terms of the Option Plan. As noted above, there was no suggestion that the
    grant of the Options in the Consulting Agreement had been effected without
    authority or that they were invalid. The Stock Option Agreement confirmed that
    the grant, including its five year exercise period,  was to be considered as

    in issue here. But the terms of the grant of the Options in the Consulting
    Agreement, as confirmed in the Stock Option Agreement, were specific about the
    exercise period, and about the exact and only events that would shorten it.
    They were the reflection of the parties having specifically addressed the term
    and exercise period for these Options for this option holder. Section
    2.3(g)(iv) of Option Plan did not displace the carefully-crafted specific
    provisions contained in the grant of the Options that defined the exercise
    period for them, when those specific provisions were, under Section 2.3(a) of
    the Option Plan, to be given priority.<span style='color:red'> </span></span></p>

    interpretation cannot stand. Applying well-established principles of
    contractual interpretation results in the conclusion that the Options had not
    expired when the exercise occurred. </span></p>

    it is not necessary to consider the  arguments about whether the application
    judge erred in finding that there was a breach of the Non-Competition Agreement
    and on that basis denying relief from forfeiture. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In oral argument, the parties agreed that the
    application judge had the power to award damages, even though the proceeding
    was brought by application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants argue that it was not open to the
    application judge, in assessing damages, to reject or doubt the credibility of Fuller’s
    evidence that he would have caused the shares to be sold at or around their
    peak price in January 2018. Nor, they say, was it open to the application judge
    to treat the expert’s calculation as a mere mathematical exercise dependent on
    that evidence. They argue that Aphria did not challenge Fuller’s damages evidence
    in cross-examination or lead its own expert evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this argument. The
    application judge was not obliged to accept Fuller’s evidence about when he
    would have caused the shares to be sold, which was not a matter of historical
    fact but of conjecture. The application judge was entitled to assess that
    evidence against the common sense improbability of someone being able to accurately
    determine, in real time and without hindsight, when shares were at or near their
    peak. He was entitled to view the expert’s evidence as dependent on an
    assumption that the application judge did not accept.</span></p>

    deference on appeal and the grounds for appellate interference are limited: <em>Naylor

lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The starting measure of damages for breach of an
    agreement that results from the exercise of an option to acquire shares in a
    public corporation is the difference between the exercise price and the share
    price at the time of exercise: <em>W.C. Pitfield &amp; Co. v. Jomac Gold
    Syndicate Ltd.</em>, [1938] 3 D.L.R. 158 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 164-165. The application
    judge’s approach assessed damages in an amount more generous to the appellants than
    that. It was generous in two respects. First, it included some amount to
    reflect Fuller’s stated desire to cause the shares to be held after they were
    acquired and sold later at better prices. Second, the  application judge made
    no deduction for the opportunity the appellants would have had, when the
    exercise was refused, to buy Aphria shares in the market and benefit from the rise
    in prices that subsequently occurred. There is no reversible error in the
    application judge’s approach about which the appellants can complain.</span></p>

    set aside the dismissal of the application, and substitute an order that Aphria
    pay damages to JPF in the amount assessed by the application judge, namely $2,820,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Success on the appeal was divided, but the
    appellants have enjoyed the greater measure of success. I would therefore award
    costs of the appeal to the appellants in the sum of $12,500, inclusive of
    disbursements and applicable taxes. The parties did not address the costs of
    the application in the event the appeal were allowed. If the parties wish to do
    so they may make written submissions, not to exceed three pages each, within ten
    days of the release of these reasons.</span></p>
