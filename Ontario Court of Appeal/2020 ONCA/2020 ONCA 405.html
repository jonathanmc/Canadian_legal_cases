  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h2>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>W.M. is the mother of both complainants, V.M.
    and W.M.(1). W.M.(1) has a twin brother. The three children lived with their
    mother after she separated from her previous husband. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>W.M. met the appellant shortly after the
    separation. The appellant worked at a convenience store close to W.M.’s house.
    He came to Canada from Iraq, where most of his family remained. In addition to
    working, the appellant attended college.  </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>W.M. frequently took her children to the store
    where the appellant worked to buy them candy. The appellant and W.M. eventually
    started to have a relationship. After a few months, the appellant occasionally
    stayed overnight at W.M.’s house but maintained his own residence. The
    frequency of his overnight visits was contentious at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship between the appellant and W.M.
    lasted about two years. They had different ideas about the nature of their
    relationship. W.M. wanted a committed relationship, while the appellant was
    content with something more casual. He was concerned that his family, for
    cultural reasons, would never fully accept W.M. When the relationship ended,
    W.M. was deeply disappointed.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As discussed in more detail below, the
    appellant’s relationships with V.M. and W.M.(1) were very different. Whereas
    W.M.(1) liked the appellant and got along well with him, V.M. did not; their relationship
    was fraught and conflictual. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Allegations of V.M.</span></h2>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>V.M., the older of the two girls, was initially wary
    of the appellant because he was the first person their mother dated after her
    marriage ended. V.M. did not have a good feeling about the appellant when he

    and described a “dry humping” motion. As things progressed, he touched her
    breast area under and over her bra. He also put his hand under V.M.’s underwear
    and touched her buttocks. On some occasions, the appellant did this while he
    was on top of V.M. The incidents lasted about 45 minutes on average.</span></p>

    suggestion that the appellant came to her room about twice a week, both during
    the week and on weekends. In terms of the number of times the appellant stayed

    that she made fun of his accent, disliked the food he cooked, and once told him
    to go back to where he came from. She said that she did not have a specific
    memory of these things because it happened so long ago, “but I’m not going to
    say I didn't say it”. At one point in her testimony she said, “Again, I don't
    have a memory of it, but I didn’t like him and I don’t think I was the nicest
    and I probably said some hurtful things.” V.M. explained that she disliked one
    of the spices he used to cook and she reported having misophonia – a negative,
    emotional reaction to certain sounds, such as the sound of people eating or
    chewing their food.   </span></p>

    he would sometimes leave the bedroom to use the washroom. He also went to the
    girls’ bedrooms to say “good night” to them. She thought it was “sweet” that he
    wanted to tuck them in, but she did not see it happen. In cross-examination, W.M.
    agreed that she never woke up to find that the appellant was not there;

    commitment to any marriage, or move in.” W.M. said, “Sure, and we can have fun”.
    It was not until a few months later that he explained to W.M. what “best
    friends” meant. He advised her that it was always his intention to marry
    someone from his own culture. This was the source of arguments between them. He
    did not tell any of his relatives that he was dating W.M. as it would have been

    relationship with V.M. She criticized his cooking and the way he spoke. The

    from W.M.’s house, and that the convenience store and the college he attended
    were both nearby (essentially equidistant from his home and W.M.’s house).
    However, the appellant said it “didn’t matter” how close they were because he
    never tried it. The appellant kept a t-shirt and underwear at W.M.’s home, and

    155-156:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>By way of overall observation, both
    complainants testified as mature adult women about events that occurred when
    they were children. In my view, [W.M.(1)] was measured but more subdued in her
    testimony. V.M. was thoughtful and balanced in her testimony. V.M. conceded
    that there were limitations on her memory. Both complainants were emotional at
    times. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Mr. H.] was a guarded witness and appeared

    find his evidence unconvincing. He was neither a credible nor a reliable
    witness.”  The trial judge observed that the appellant was “motivated by an
    attempt to distance himself from any likely opportunity to have committed these
    offences”. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In its closing submissions, the Crown argued
    that the evidence of each complainant could be used as similar fact evidence in
    considering the evidence of the other. The appellant resisted the application. In
    his reasons, the trial judge concluded that “standing alone and independent to each
    other, the complainants’ evidence was proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Nonetheless,
    he allowed the similar fact application and analyzed the evidence within this
    framework.  </span></p>

    improperly used a prior statement made by V.M.; improperly relied upon common

    the disclosure; and erred in his similar fact evidence ruling. As noted in
    para. 4, above, all grounds of appeal drive towards the same point – the trial

    the things she said to the appellant as a child. The trial judge addressed this

  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>I found that V.M. was candid with the court
    when she admitted she did have gaps in her memory and was not prepared to fill
    the gaps with untruths</span></u><span lang=EN-CA>. V.M. also admitted to
    unflattering aspects to her personality when she was a teenager. <u>In my view,
    the name calling was not just indicative of a jealous teenage girl but had
    borderline racist overtones.</u> V.M. detested the foods which he ate and the
    way he prepared meals. In addition, she made fun of his accent. <u>In my view,
    these admissions enhanced her credibility</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    V.M. credit for being racist, when it should have undermined her trustworthiness.
    I disagree. In this passage, the trial judge dealt with a number of aspects of
    V.M.’s evidence, including her candid admission to behaviour that reflected
    poorly on her and her refusal to fill in the gaps when she could not remember
    certain things.</span></p>

    judge mischaracterized V.M.’s willingness to admit her faults, especially with
    respect to her treatment of the appellant. Instead of being forthcoming, V.M.
    only admitted unfavourable aspects when pressed in cross-examination. This was
    all laid out before the trial judge and he was entitled to view the evidence as
    he did.</span></p>

    this issue was addressed at trial. Trial counsel did not suggest to V.M. that
    she was racist; nor did counsel ask the trial judge to characterize her
    treatment of the appellant as racist. V.M. was 12 to 14 years old at the time. The
    trial judge recognized the obvious impropriety in what she said to the
    appellant and he used the expression “borderline racist” of his own accord. His
    failure to characterize this misbehaviour of a child in stronger language, with
    a greater impact on her trustworthiness many years later, is not indicative of

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I also have difficulty with the defence
    companion theory that W.M.(1) was in so much hot water with her mother and was
    on the cusp of losing phone and computer privileges that she chose the “nuclear
    option” and concocted a scheme, with her sister to point the finger of blame at
    [Mr. H.]. W.M. questioned W.M.(1) if she was being bullied at her new school or
    if there were any other problems. <u>It seemed logical that she could have escaped
    her mother’s wrath by availing herself to other excuses or explanations in
    order to get out of trouble.</u> Moreover, W.M.(1) had no credible reason years
    later (absent the allegations) to hate [Mr. H.] that much and falsely accuse
    him of sexual assault. W.M.(1) testified that she was ambivalent towards [Mr.

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the defence submission that

    that W.M.(1) did not dislike him. In fact, he testified that W.M.(1) loved him
    and there were no problems in their relationship when he broke up with W.M. <u>I
    agree with the Crown’s submissions that it made no sense that even though
    W.M.(1) was aware of V.M.’s hatred towards [Mr. H.] that years later, according

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The defence argued that given that there were
    open hostilities between [Mr. H.] and V.M. it defied credulity that [Mr. H.]
    was that intrepid to enter V.M.’s bedroom during the night. <u>On its face it
    was an intriguing argument. However, another reasonable inference could be that
    [Mr. H.] had engaged in a regular routine of abuse and since V.M. did not
    complain it may have emboldened him.</u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    the evidence. V.M. testified that although she disliked the appellant, she was
    not able to disclose the abuse, especially given her mother’s love for the
    appellant. Moreover, V.M. testified that, while she did not like the appellant
    from the beginning, her antipathy for him became more intense after the sexual
    abuse started. Accordingly, I reject the appellant’s expansive contention that
    this portion of the trial judge’s reasons is indicative of a “pattern of taking

    appellant. The appellant alleged that W.M. and V.M. were evasive about the

lang=EN-CA>, that the appellant threw a phone at her. The appellant submits,
    “One would have thought that [W.M.] would remember such a memorable incident. A
    more plausible inference is that this incident never took place and was another
    example of [V.M.’s] lies.” Once again, this submission quibbles with the
    credibility findings of the trial judge. It also ignores that it was his
    province to accept some, none, or all of a witness’ evidence. This evidence was
    not referenced in the closing submissions of the Crown or the defence. It was
    not important.  </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant challenges the trial judge’s finding
    that the complainants testified in a thoughtful and balanced way. He submits
    that this was unfair because his own testimony was characterized as “evasive
    and combative”. He relies on the fact that the complaints often “refused to
    answer questions” with “I don’t know” or “I can’t remember”. Apparently, this
    type of response was collectively invoked 400 times by the complainants, in response
    to questions about things “that the complainants could be expected to remember”.</span></p>

    evasive, but the trial judge did not. He was entitled to reach this conclusion.
    There are a number of reasons why it is not indicative of a skewed approach.
    First, the complainants testified about events that happened in 2002 to 2004,
    when they were both young. Second, a witness’ response of “I don’t know” or “I
    don’t remember” does not necessarily amount to a “refusal” to answer. Third, without
    more, the number of times that these types of answers were given is unhelpful.
    The appellant also asserted a lack of memory numerous times in his testimony.
    As he said at one point in his cross-examination, “There are things I remember
    and there are things I forget.” Lastly, trial counsel did not urge the trial
    judge to make this finding about the complainants, presumably because of the
    appellant’s responses along the same lines.</span></p>

    the first two examples discussed below (“Infrequency of staying overnight” and

    judge said, at para. 8: “According to W.M. [Mr. H.] stayed over approximately
    two or three times a week.” This seems to have been a typographical mistake; it
    was V.M. who estimated this frequency, not her mother. Nevertheless, the trial
    judge accurately recorded W.M.’s frequency evidence in para. 43 of his reasons:
    “After they initially dated [W.M.] estimated that [Mr. H.] stayed over
    approximately once every week or every two weeks until the end of the

    para. 41: “I do not intend to spend a lot of time outlining W.M.’s evidence as
    will be explained further on in my reasons.” In summarizing the parties’
    positions, the trial judge wrote, at para. 107:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It was conceded by both the Crown and the

    which he did not refer which, if accepted, would have been damaging to the

    over during the week; W.M. said that he did, but not frequently. W.M. said
    there was a 2-4 week trial period when they tried living together; the
    appellant said this never happened. W.M. said that the relationship had been
    serious and they might have married had the appellant’s family approved; the
    appellant said marriage had never been a possibility. Perhaps most importantly,
    W.M. testified that the appellant would go to her children’s bedrooms to tuck
    them in at night; the appellant denied this happened. On this last point,
    W.M.’s evidence was potentially very damning to the appellant, who claimed
    minimal opportunities to commit the offences, and insisted on never leaving the
    master bedroom except to use the bathroom after having sex with W.M. </span></p>

    engaging in an unbalanced assessment of the evidence, as the appellant

    says the issue should have been decided differently: “There is nothing bizarre
    about remembering such an incident. It would have been more unusual if he had
    no memory of what appeared to be a significant confrontation.” It must be
    remembered that the trial judge made this assessment in the light of his
    general findings that the appellant had sought to minimize his opportunities to
    commit the offences against the complainants. The conclusions he reached were available
    to him on the record.</span></p>

    misapprehended the evidence on this issue. He says that the evidence confirmed his
    view that there was a lock on this bedroom door. But the evidence was
    conflicting. W.M. testified that she did not remember whether the kids’ rooms
    had locks. However, she later said that V.M. would lock her door after
    arguments. W.M.(1) testified that she did not think V.M. had a lock on her
    door. V.M. flatly denied the suggestion: “There was not a lock on my door, I
    was not allowed to have locks.”</span></p>

    whether or not there was a lock on V.M.’s bedroom door, but the appellant’s
    claim to have remembered such a trivial detail, years later, and especially in
    light of the trial judge’s broader conclusion that the appellant attempted to
    distance himself from opportunities to commit the offences. His reasons reveal
    no error, nor any inclination to hold the appellant’s evidence to a higher

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When he was confronted with his testimony in
    his previous trial that in fact he admitted that he had taken the entire family

    clever response, which perhaps technically may be accurate to the specific
    question poised, it was an unpersuasive answer that was intended to not fully
    answer the question. In my view, if [Mr. H.] wanted to be open and honest in
    his evidence he should have fully answered the question, rather than focusing
    on a slight language distinction to cover the fact that he did not recall

    this exchange. Allowing for the fact that other judges may have treated the

    too harsh in his criticism of his evidence on the issue of whether he ever left
    the bedroom at night. The appellant testified that, following intimacies with
    W.M., he would use the bathroom. The appellant was asked about his testimony at
    his first trial when he said that he never left the room. He clarified that,
    once he and W.M. had gone to sleep, he never left the bedroom. This exchange
    was made problematic by the trial Crown’s tendency to summarize the questions

    the appellant’s evidence on this point. As he said, at para. 174:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I also found that during the entirety of the
    relationship [Mr. H.’s] claim that he never left the bedroom at night other
    than when he went to the washroom after sex difficult to accept. His previous
    trial testimony, which was put to him, made it clear that he never left the
    bedroom after going to sleep. However, in his current testimony when he said that
    he did leave the bedroom after sex he did go to the washroom. There was a
    defence objection that the Crown’s question was about not leaving the bedroom
    after sex. However, [Mr. H.] admitted that he never left the bedroom at all. <u>I
    simply find this hard to believe. In my view, it was another transparent

    for uneven scrutiny. The complaint he makes is not so much about the
    application of discordant standards as it is about the complainants being
    believed when he was not. In essence, the appellant’s claim was an assertion of
    an unreasonable verdict. Referring to the shortcomings in the evidence of the
    complainants, the appellant submits in his factum: “Any number of these flaws
    would have been ample basis to raise a reasonable doubt. The cumulative
    evidence of these credibility flaws made the verdict unreasonable.” </span></p>

    placed undue emphasis on evidence of demeanour when he characterized the
    appellant as “uneasy” and “guarded”. The appellant asserts that, “Particularly
    given the cultural and linguistic differences – [Mr. H.] is a relatively recent
    immigrant who speaks English as a second language – the Court should be mindful
    of overemphasizing demeanour and making assumptions about culturally
    appropriate conduct.”</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Respectfully, there is no merit in this
    submission. There was not a hint in the trial judge’s reasons that he made any
    assumptions about the appellant’s linguistic abilities. The appellant declined
    the assistance of the Assyrian interpreter who had originally been requested
    for the trial. There is no indication in the record that the appellant
    struggled to express himself. Moreover, I fail to see any connection between
    the trial judge’s use of the terms “uneasy” or “guarded” and the appellant’s
    allusion to “culturally appropriate conduct”.</span></p>

    guard against </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>undue</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> reliance on demeanour. That does not mean that demeanour is irrelevant. It is

    in using a prior statement made by V.M. as confirmatory of her trial testimony.
    This ground of appeal relates to the incident in which V.M. called the
    appellant a “pervert”. This evidence was adduced by the defence in its
    cross-examination of V.M. in an effort to demonstrate that she made things up
    about the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge referred
    to this incident as “quite telling”. He said: “I agree that there was no
    confirmatory evidence that [Mr. H.] threw a telephone in response. However,
    W.M., V.M., and [Mr. H.] agreed that the word ‘pervert’ had been used at some
    point in time. I accept as a fact that at the time V.M. was reaching out to her
    mother.”</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was tracking the language of
    V.M. in her assessment of the incident. It is important to appreciate the
    context in which the statement was made. V.M. said she made the comment because
    the appellant watched television shows that she thought were inappropriate.
    This would embarrass her when she had company over. V.M. explained:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It wasn't something that was ever on in my
    house prior to that…I didn’t know how to handle the situation because my
    relationship with my mother at the time was rocky at best, and I felt helpless,

lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Moreover, the trial judge’s finding was made
    after a finding in favour of the appellant, based on the totality of the
    evidence, that there was no confirmation for V.M.’s evidence that the appellant
    threw his phone at her. It would have been preferable had the trial judge further
    explained why he referred to the “reaching out” statement. However, there is no
    indication that it played any further role in his analysis, nor that he used it
    to bolster V.M.’s credibility.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in making a common sense assumption about the nature of the appellant’s
    relationship with W.M. In his consideration of how often the appellant stayed
    overnight, and whether he stayed over on weeknights (which the appellant
    denied), the trial judge referenced the strong feelings that the appellant said
    that he had for W.M. at the time. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination, the appellant agreed with
    the suggestion that he and W.M. “wanted to spend basically all the time [they]
    could together”. The trial judge considered this evidence along with the
    evidence that the appellant often went to W.M.’s house for dinner during the
    week, kept underwear and a t-shirt at the house, and that W.M.’s house was
    close to the appellant’s own residence, his place of employment, and the
    college he attended. But as the trial judge said, at para. 172, “It was
    difficult to accept that never once given all the circumstances, as he
    testified, [Mr. H.] never slept over on a week night even though he admitted
    that he wanted to spend as much time as he could with W.M.” </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not make unwarranted assumptions about human

    contradiction between the appellant’s stated actions and his purported state of
    mind. The appellant testified that he wanted to spend as much time as he could
    with W.M., but he also testified that he did not even try to stay overnight
    more frequently. Again, these findings must be considered within the trial
    judge’s overall assessment that the appellant sought to minimize his access and
    opportunities to commit the offences.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not giving
    effect to the argument that V.M.’s delay in disclosure should have given the trial
    judge pause for concern because she was an assertive person who was not shy
    about criticizing the appellant. Such a person would be expected to make a
    timely disclosure, so the argument goes. The trial judge disagreed, at para.
    160:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>V.M. was a strong minded and opinionated
    teenager, however, I do not accept that just because she was an “in your face”
    teenager that should have made her more inclined to disclose the alleged sexual
    abuse. <u>This was close to the stereotypical reasoning in sexual assault cases
    that courts strive to avoid in engaging.</u> The defence promoted the idea [that]
    V.M. always stood up for herself and in fact was extremely disrespectful and
    rude to [Mr. H.], so why did she not disclose the allegations? <u>Whether as a
    teenage girl V.M. was insecure about her relationship with her mother or
    whether both complainants were not emotionally equipped to deal with the sexual
    abuse and to tell anyone about it, was neither here nor there. The delay in
    disclosure standing alone does not give rise to an adverse inference against

    Writing for the majority, Major J. held that, in order to dispel the
    possibility of stereotypical reasoning, a trial judge should instruct the jury
    that “there is no inviolable rule on how people who are the victims of trauma
    like a sexual assault will behave”; “the timing of the complaint is simply one
    circumstances to consider in the factual mosaic of a particular case”, and “[a]
    delay in disclosure, standing alone, will never give rise to an adverse
    inference against the credibility of the complainant”: </span><em><span
