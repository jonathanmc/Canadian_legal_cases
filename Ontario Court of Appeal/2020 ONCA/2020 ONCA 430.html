    a failed renewable energy project that was to be built and operated by a

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2007, Greenview Power entered into a
    Renewable Energy Standard Offer Program Contract (“RESOP Contract”) to build a
    biomass renewable energy facility to generate and supply electricity to the
    Ontario Power Authority. The respondent, the Independent Electricity System
    Operator (“IESO”), is the Authority’s successor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Greenview Power’s obligations under the RESOP
    Contract were to build a renewable energy facility and supply electricity for a
    period of 20 years beginning on November 8, 2010, the “Commercial Operation
    Date.” Greenview Power could not meet this deadline and the IESO amended the
    RESOP Contract twice, extending the Commercial Operation Date to January 15,
    2013. According to the appellant, Hutchingame Growth Capital Corporation
    (“HGC”), the RESOP Contract had a potential revenue stream of $80 million over
    its 20-year term.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Greenview Power could not meet the original or
    revised deadlines in the RESOP Contract for reaching commercial operation. To
    save the project, in the fall of 2012, HGC, led by its principal Eric
    Hutchingame, purchased some of Greenview Power’s secured debt and assumed its effective
    control. Another Hutchingame investment vehicle<i>, </i><span style='color:
black'>Sea to Sky Pollution Solutions Corporation (“Sea to Sky”), played a
    supporting role.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2013, HGC entered into the Waiver and
    Amending Agreement with Greenview Power, the IESO, and Greenview Power’s other
    secured creditors. The Agreement waived specified events of default under the
    RESOP Contract and amended various targets under it, setting November 8, 2015
    as the new Commercial Operation Date. However, Greenview Power went bankrupt on
    February 24, 2014 and the RESOP Contract terminated.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>HGC could have revived the RESOP Contract under
    s. 9.2(3), a provision in the Contract that permitted it, as a secured creditor,
    to step into the bankrupt’s shoes. Instead of invoking this provision, HGC tried
    to assign its rights under the RESOP Contract to Truestar Investments Ltd.,
    including the RESOP Contract, using s. 9.2(2). The trustee obtained a vesting
    order from the bankruptcy court that approved Truestar’s purchase of Greenview
    Power’s assets.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the RESOP Contract
    clearly stated that it would terminate on bankruptcy, that HGC’s efforts to
    assign the Contract to Truestar failed, and that HGC had failed to prove that
    it was entitled to damages for breach of contract or negligence. He dismissed HGC’s
    action. </span></p>

    questions for determination:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the RESOP Contract terminate automatically when

  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Was the vesting order effective in vesting the

  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>Before analyzing these questions, I

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Factual Context</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The root of the case lies in the standard form
    2007 RESOP Contract. Section&nbsp;7 expressly stipulates the acts of default by
    a generator like Greenview Power that could result in the Contract’s termination.
    Some of the defaults could be cured within 30 days after the generator received
    written notice from the IESO. However, the RESOP Contract provided that when a
    generator files a proposal under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, or makes an assignment in bankruptcy, then the Contract
    terminates automatically without the need for the IESO to provide notice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 9.2 of the RESOP Contract, which is
    reproduced in the Appendix to this decision, gave HGC certain rights as a
    secured creditor. Section 9.2(2) allowed HGC to enforce its security by
    acquiring Greenview Power’s interest, defined as “the right, title and interest
    of the Generator in or to the Contract Facility and this Agreement or any
    benefit or advantage of any of the foregoing,” and then selling or assigning
    the interest to a third party. The s. 9.2(2) right to assign was subject to s.
    13.4 of the RESOP Contract, which added two relevant stipulations. First, under
    s. 13.4(1), the Generator (Greenview Power and subsequently HGC, which stepped
    into Greenview Power’s shoes under the RESOP Contract) was obliged to provide
    prior written notice of any assignment to the IESO. Second, s. 13.4(4) provided
    that: “<span style='color:black'>No assignment of this Agreement shall be valid
    or effective and no change of Control shall be permitted if the assigning Party
    is in default at the time of the assignment or change of Control.” </span>Upon
    taking control of Greenview Power earlier, under s. 9.2(2), HGC, standing in
    Greenview Power’s shoes, became “bound by all of the Generator’s rights and
    obligations hereunder so long as it is the owner or is in control or possession
    of the Generator’s Interest.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 9.2(3) provided that if an identified
    “Generator Event of Default” terminated the RESOP Contract before the end of
    its term, then a secured creditor like HGC could revive it by assuming Greenview
    Power’s position. To do so, s.&nbsp;9.2(3) required HGC to send a written request
    to the IESO within 90 days of the default that led to the Contract’s
    termination, pay the outstanding amounts, including fees owing to the IESO, and
    cure any outstanding defaults under the Contract. </span></p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Linespacingsingle1><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Greenview Power defaults and enters into the
    2013 Waiver and Amending Agreement</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Greenview Power defaulted under the RESOP Contract
    by filing a notice of intention to make a proposal under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency
    Act</i> in November 2012. It also missed several targeted dates by which commercial
    operation was to begin. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 15, 2013, Greenview Power entered into
    the Waiver and Amending Agreement with the IESO, HGC, and its other secured
    creditors. The Agreement waived the effect of Greenview Power’s proposal under
    the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> and its other defaults. It also
    amended certain provisions of the RESOP Contract. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sea to Sky also signed in its capacity as
    interim funder under the proposal. Sea to Sky provided interim financing through
    a loan made by Truestar to Sea to Sky. Under the loan agreement, Sea to Sky
    agreed to assign to Truestar all of its interest in the loan being made to
    Greenview Power and the security that it took over the Greenview assets. As
    interim funder, Sea to Sky was granted priority for advances that it made to
    Greenview Power.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is worth noting that the IESO could have
    relied on Greenview Power’s proposal under the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act </i>as a terminating event. But the IESO wanted the project to succeed. The
    IESO’s counsel, Harry Fogul, testified that the IESO was prepared to allow the project
    to proceed because: “</span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>the
    proposal was accepted and Greenview was going to complete the project in
    accordance with the terms of the proposal and in accordance with the terms of
    the RESOP contract, that was what [was] understood and that’s what the
    intention was.” He added: “technically speaking the contract would have
    terminated but for the fact that the [IESO] was prepared to waive it, which is
    why the agreement was called a waiver and amending agreement. It was waiving
    the default.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that after the parties
    entered into the Waiver and Amending Agreement, HGC took “no immediate real
    action” to meet Greenview Power’s new obligations and to put the project back
    on track to meet the revised Commercial Operation Date: at para. 27. </span></p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Linespacingsingle1><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Greenview Power goes bankrupt</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 24, 2014, Greenview Power made an
    assignment in bankruptcy, which had the effect of automatically terminating the
    RESOP Contract. The trial judge found that HGC did not engage the process required
    by s. 9.2(3) to revive the Contract, despite making representations to the IESO
    that it was doing so: at para. 55.</span></p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Linespacingsingle1><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>HGC tries to assign its interest to Truestar</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>HGC took a different tack. On May 15, 2014, several
    months after Greenview Power’s bankruptcy, HGC and Sea to Sky advised the IESO
    that they wanted to exercise their rights under s. 9.2(2) of the RESOP Contract.
    On the same day, and without advising the IESO, HGC alone entered into an
    assignment agreement with Truestar in which it purported to assign its interest
    in the RESOP Contract and in the Waiver and Amending Agreement, along with its
    security interest in Greenview Power, to Truestar for $4.7 million. The
    assignment was prepared without legal assistance. The principals of HGC, Mr.
    Hutchingame, and Truestar, William Baker, are longstanding acquaintances. </span></p>

    revive the terminated agreement within 90 days of the bankruptcy if it paid

    under s. 9.2(2) without first curing the outstanding defaults: at para. 132. He
    noted that an assignment is only permitted in accordance with s. 13.4, which
    states that “No assignment of this Agreement shall be valid or effective and no
    change of Control shall be permitted if the assigning Party is in default at
    the time of the assignment or change of Control”: at para. 133. The trial judge
    held that, since Greenview Power, in whose shoes HGC effectively stood, was in
    default at the time of the purported assignment, HGC could not assign its interests
    in the RESOP Contract or the Waiver and Amending Agreement. The trial judge
    reasoned that a secured creditor could not have greater rights to assume and
    assign Greenview Power’s obligations under the RESOP Contract than Greenview
    Power itself would have had: at para.&nbsp;136.</span></p>

    s. 9.2 of the RESOP Contract. Once the Contract was automatically terminated, HGC’s
    sole avenue to wring value out of it was to pursue its rights under s. 9.2(3).
    If it wanted to assign its interest to Truestar under s. 9.2(2), it could only
    do that after reviving the Contract under s. 9.2(3). But, as Mr. Hutchingame’s
    trial evidence suggests, he might have avoided this course of action, in part,
    because he did not want to incur the expense. </span></p>

    ignoring the effect of the vesting order, which was to vest the RESOP Contract
    in Truestar. The vesting order stated: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>All of the Bankrupt’s and Trustee’s right,
    title and interest in and to the Property and the Purchased Assets [defined to

    Contract “could only be assigned by following the process mandated by section
    9.2(3) of the RESOP Contract”: at para. 63. He said: “the evidence shows that

    arriving at this conclusion, he canvassed the evidence on the vesting order: at
    paras. 60-64 and 142-154. The trial judge was attentive to the “unusual”
    circumstances surrounding the vesting order, particularly that the IESO was not
    served with motion materials and the motion was made without notice to the IESO,
    that both the trustee and the court were unaware of the $4.7 million assignment
    to Truestar, and that “Mr.&nbsp;Hutchingame’s dealings were secretive, and he
    delayed directly addressing the [IESO’s] position until … it was too late”: at

    vehicle for that success. That was communicated to HGC. Mr. Fogul testified: </span><span

    the RESOP contract out of it and proceed under 9.2(3).”</span></p>

    that point he understood that “the trustee [would] bring a motion to amend the
    order[,] change the purchaser, and remove the RESOP contract” from the assets
    to be vested. This understanding arose from a conference call between Mr.
    Fogul, counsel for the trustee, counsel for HGC, and Mr. Hutchingame, to which the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.  Did you get instructions from the [IESO]
    to bring any - any motion to amend the vesting order? </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.  No, because at that point I had understood

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.  Well, from the last call we had on the

    trial judge observed that: “<span style='color:black'>The [IESO] might have

    of honesty in contractual performance ‘does not impose a duty of loyalty or of
    disclosure or require a party to forgo advantages flowing from the contract’”:

    during the 90-day period in which HGC could have asked to revive the RESOP Contract,
    the trial judge found that the IESO’s actions did not constitute bad faith or a
    breach of the general duty of honesty in contractual performance. He stated, at
    para. 127:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I do not find that this constituted bad faith

    because the [IESO] did not lie or otherwise mislead [HGC], and the [IESO’s]
    understanding of section 9.2(3) of the RESOP Contract was straightforward and
    correct. I also find that thereafter the [IESO] acted honestly and in good
    faith, and made all reasonable efforts to facilitate [HGC’s] obtaining a new
    agreement under section 9.2(3) of the RESOP Contract; this is quite apparent
    from the evidence…[.]</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>The IESO’s efforts to help revive the

    terminated. The trial judge quoted this evidence, noting that Mr. Hutchingame
    “considered it to be a declaration of war”: at para. 54. But the trial judge
    then pointed out some 11 actions that belied Mr. Hutchingame’s asserted
    position, noting that his communications made “no mention <span

    at paras. 54-55, 67. He did not find Mr. Hutchingame to be credible, remarking

    that HGC was not fully aware of the automatic termination provision, the IESO’s
    silence during the 90-day period did not prejudice HGC. This is because the
    IESO effectively waived HGC’s obligation to give written notice within the
    90-day period of its intention to trigger the revival of the RESOP Contract
    under s. 9.2(3) by working with HGC to get the vesting order amended, an effort
    that HGC itself abandoned. There was no basis for HGC’s argument that the IESO
