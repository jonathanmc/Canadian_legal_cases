lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the Crown lead evidence to support the
    theory that Mr. Sousa was guilty of a violent sexual assault. That evidence is
    as follows: Mr. Sousa left a party with a heavily intoxicated woman who was in
    and out of consciousness. The two were strangers. He drove her to a wooded area
    and had forced vaginal and anal sex with her. The victim was unable to stop the
    assault. He then put the victim back in the car and drove her to an unfamiliar
    area and removed her from the car. She began to scream and nearby residents came
    to her assistance. A 911 call was made and police interviewed the complainant. She
    could not identify her attacker other than to say he was a male with short “regular
    style” hair and was six feet tall. A year after the incident, police obtained a
    DNA sample that matched that of Mr.&nbsp;Sousa at 15 STR loci.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Sousa’s defence was that the police planted
    the DNA to frame him. He claimed the police could have planted his DNA on the
    swab because he was their main suspect, they had no identification evidence,
    and the case was getting cold.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Sousa represented himself at trial with the

    on January 13, 2020, by Ramsay J. to ten years in custody minus a few months to

    permit him to work, and travel to and from his place of work, without his

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An applicant may apply to vary bail conditions
    so long as they “satisf[y] the conditions of s. 679(3) namely, it is not a
    frivolous appeal, the terms of the release are not contrary to the public
    interest and the appellant can be expected to surrender himself prior to the
    hearing”: <em>R. v. White</em> (1994), 72 O.A.C. 300, at para.&nbsp;7 (C.A.). <span
style='color:black'>Section</span> 679(3) <span style='color:black'>of the </span><em>Criminal
    Code,</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em>R.S.C., 1985, c.
    C-46, provides as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>… the judge of the court of appeal may
    order that the appellant be released pending the determination of his appeal if
    the applicant establishes that</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) the appeal or application for
    leave to appeal is not frivolous;</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) he will surrender himself
    into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(c) his detention is not
    necessary in the public interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown concedes that this appeal is not
    frivolous and that the applicant will surrender into custody when required. The
    only issue is whether it is necessary in the public interest to maintain to
    current strict bail conditions. For reasons that follow, I find that it is.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>              The </span><span lang=EN-CA>First</span><span
lang=EN-CA> Factor: The Strength of the Appeal</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Sousa’s principal ground of appeal is that
    the trial judge erred in determining that a recent federal law (“Bill C-75”)
    removing peremptory challenges applied retrospectively to criminal proceedings
    that had started but not finished, before Bill C-75 came into force.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the time his jury was selected, Mr. Sousa was
    not advised of the amendments to the <em>Criminal Code</em> in Bill 75, nor was
    he given the opportunity to challenge jurors peremptorily. The trial judge
    rather than triers, heard the challenges for cause to prospective jurors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After his trial concluded, this court rendered
    its decision in <em>R. v. Chouhan</em>, 2020 ONCA 40, 149 O.R. (3d) 365, leave
    to appeal granted, [2020] S.C.C.A. No. 19. In that case, Watt J.A. at paras. 5
    and 217 held as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he abolition of the peremptory challenge
    applies prospectively, that is to say, only to cases where the accused’s right
    to a trial by judge and jury vested on or after September 19, 2019. But I
    conclude the amendment making the presiding judge the trier of all challenges
    for cause applied retrospectively, that is to say, to all cases tried on or
    after September 19, 2019….</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he abolition of peremptory challenges
    affected the substantive rights of the appellant, thus it should not have
    applied to the selection of the jury in his case nor should it apply to the
    selection of the jury in other cases if the accused had a vested right before
    September 19, 2019 to a trial by judge and jury as it existed in the prior

    MacMillan</em>, 2020 ONCA 141. In that case, Macpherson J.A. held that “[t]his
    argument is far removed from being frivolous. Indeed it is almost the opposite;
    it is almost certain to succeed.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since those decisions were released, the Supreme
    Court has granted leave to appeal the <em>Chouhan</em> decision relied on in <em>MacMillan</em>,
    but that appeal has not yet been heard. Until then, <em>Chouhan</em> is the law
    in Ontario and must be applied.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Sousa also argues that the trial judge erred
    in denying him the right to present the jury with the complainant’s inconsistent
    descriptions of her attacker. He points out that in <em>R. v. Mullin</em>, 2019
    ONCA 890, 383 C.C.C. (3d) 16, at para. 41, the court held:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The law permits the introduction of excited or
    spontaneous utterances as an exception to the rule against hearsay: a “statement
    relating to a startling event or condition … may be admitted to prove the truth
    of its contents if it is made while the declarant is under the stress of
    excitement cause[d] by the event or condition”: David M. Paccioco &amp; L. Stuesser, <em>The Law of Evidence</em>, 7th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2015), at p. 191.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These statements by the complainant were made
    fairly soon after this vicious attack on the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, this appeal is not frivolous;
    on the contrary, based on the current law the applicant has a strong chance of
    success on appeal to secure a new trial. The basis for the appeal however is
    not one that goes to guilt or innocence but primarily relates to the technical
    selection of jurors.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>              </span><span lang=EN-CA>The Second Factor:
    Whether the Applicant will Surrender into         Custody when Required</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown concedes that the second factor to be
    considered in s. 679(3) of the <em>Criminal Code,</em> whether Mr. Sousa will
    surrender into custody when required, is not at issue on this appeal. Mr. Sousa
    has complied with his bail conditions pending and throughout the trial and to
    date while on bail pending appeal.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>              The Third Factor: Whether Maintenance of
    these Strict Conditions   is Necessary in the Public Interest</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The central question is whether Mr. Sousa has
    shown, on a balance of probabilities, that his detention is not necessary in
    the public interest: see <em>R. v. Oland</em>, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R.
    250, at para. 19; <em>R. v. Iraheta</em>, 2018 ONCA 229, at para. 4.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The “public interest”
    factor in s. 679(3) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> has two parts -public safety and public
    confidence in the administration of justice: See </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Oland</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, at para. 23, and </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Farinacci</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 47-48. While public confidence in
    the administration of justice is rarely a central factor in the test, it ought
    to be considered when an offence is serious: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Oland</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, at paras. 29, 43.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Public confidence requires a balancing of
    reviewability and enforceability. In determining whether public confidence
    requires detention, the relevant factors include: (1) the seriousness of the
    crime, taking into account the gravity of the offence, the circumstances
    surrounding its commission, and the potential for a lengthy term of
    imprisonment; and (2) the strength of the appeal: see <em>Oland</em>, at paras.
    37-46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Sousa has been convicted of a very serious
    and violent sexual assault and the circumstances surrounding the commission of
    the offence are hair-raising. The potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment
    is clear and Mr. Sousa has been sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Public confidence in the administration of
    justice is important in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I note that in <em>MacMillan</em>, a case that
    also involved a very serious sexual assault, the appellant was kept on a strict
    house arrest pending appeal notwithstanding the strong chances of success on
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, prior to his conviction, Mr.
    Sousa’s bail terms only required that he reside with his surety. His fiancée
    swore that “He was working [at the same place of employment suggest on this
    application] before he went into custody” without incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>His existing bail conditions require Mr. Sousa
    to remain in the presence of his surety at all times. His surety is his
    domestic partner. He may leave his home for any reason provided he is with his
    surety at all times.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Sousa seeks to vary those terms to permit
    him to drive over one hour to and from work and work fulltime without
    supervision by his surety. Mr. Sousa notes that his father works at the same
    facility and that he would drive with him to and from work and that his surety
    has an obligation to notify the authorities if he does not leave or return home
    as scheduled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This however, does not address the fact that Mr.
    Sousa’s father is not his surety and has no obligation to account for his son’s
    whereabouts. Not is there any provision is Mr. Sousa’s father cannot go to
    work. Most importantly, there are no repercussions if the applicant fails to do
    what he says he will do as the surety is not with him going to and from or at
    work.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unlike most appeals, a new trial will likely be
    ordered, at which point he will again benefit from the presumption of
    innocence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, given the very serious nature of this
    crime and the importance of public safety and public confidence in the
    administration of justice, residual concerns about public safety are important under
    s. 679(3)(c): <em>Oland,</em> at paras. 27, 39. Thus, although the chances of
    success on appeal are strong, it is not appropriate to loosen the bail
    conditions presently in place as Mr. Sousa’s father is not a surety. In an
    application for bail pending appeal, the applicant does not benefit from a presumption
    of innocence: <em>Oland, </em>at para. 34. Public confidence would be
    undermined if Mr. Sousa were to come and go from work and work unsupervised for
    12 hours a day without supervision from a surety.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, the request to vary Mr.
    Sousa’s bail conditions is denied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the request of both parties, I will remain
    seized of this matter in respect of the issue of bail pending appeal.</span></p>
