  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, A.K., is K.H.s (the complainant)
    half-brother. They have the same father. In 2017, the appellant was charged
    with two counts of sexual assault. The offences allegedly occurred in 2008 or
    2009, when the appellant was 14 or 15 and the complainant was between 6 and 8.
    After a brief trial, in which the complainant and the appellant were the only
    witnesses, the trial judge found the appellant guilty on both charges. She
    imposed conditional discharges on both counts with 18 months probation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals from the findings of
    guilt. For the reasons that follow, we allow the appeal and order a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the time of the alleged offences, the
    complainant resided with her mother and two older brothers, E. and A., in
    Leamington, Ontario. Her father, who was also the appellants father, had access
    visits with the complainant. On occasion, the complainants father and his two
    sons, the appellant and C., would sleep over at the complainants home in
    Leamington.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified one night when the
    appellant was sleeping over with his father, he came into her bedroom. She was
    lying in bed facing away from the door. She awoke to find the appellant standing
    beside her bed. He touched her legs, butt and vagina over her clothing. When he
    tried to put his hands in her pants, the complainant rolled over away from the
    contact. The appellant left her room. Neither the appellant, nor the
    complainant said anything during the incident. It lasted about two to five
    minutes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant described a second assault about
    a month or two after the first. She and her mother were staying overnight at the
    fathers home in Kingsville, Ontario. The complainant went there on weekends to
    visit her father, often with her mother. The complainant testified the
    appellant, who lived with his mother, would sleep over at his fathers home when
    the complainant was there now and then. Because of the earlier incident in
    Leamington, the complainant tried to avoid being at her fathers home overnight
    if the appellant was going to be there.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the complainant stayed at her fathers, she
    slept on a recliner in the living room. One evening, when she was lying on the
    recliner, she saw the appellant sitting on the couch watching television close
    by. She felt the appellant touching her chest, her bum and her back. The
    touching was over her clothing. The complainant stirred in response to the
    touching. The appellant stopped and went back to watching television. Shortly
    afterward, the complainant got up from the recliner and went into her fathers bedroom.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to the two alleged sexual assaults,
    the complainant described another incident, which she recalled occurred before
    the assaults. She was in her bedroom at her mothers house playing with her Barbie
    dolls. The appellant walked by and asked her if the dolls were having sex. She
    said no. He put the dolls in a sex position and walked out of the room.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified some time after the
    alleged assaults when she was nine, she was removed from her mothers care by
    the Childrens Aid Society. Her mother suffered from serious mental health problems.
    The complainant went to live with her grandmother. She told her grandmother
    about the assaults and she thought her grandmother spoke to somebody about

    mothers residence in Leamington on only one occasion. He recalled sleeping
    there so he and his father could drive his brother to the bus station to attend
    a cadet camp in Barrie the next day. The appellant denied he went to the complainants
    bedroom and sexually assaulted her during the night. The appellant recalled
    other brief visits at the home in Leamington when he and his father went to
    that town for the appellants lacrosse games.</span></p>

    he visited his father on occasion, although at times their relationship was
    strained. He recalled when his father lived in Kingsville, he would stay at his
    fathers on the weekend, so he could get up early and go to work with his
    father and grandfather at the produce market in Detroit. According to the
    appellant, the complainant did not stay overnight at the fathers residence in
    Kingsville on any occasion when the appellant stayed there overnight.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, there was not much
    of a relationship between him and the complainant. They seldom saw each other,
    and he was much older than her. In the appellants mind, there had never been any
    problem between himself and the complainant. The complainant also described her
    relationship with the appellant as kind of distant. She rarely saw him. There
    was never any animosity between them. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge properly instructed herself on
    the burden of proof. She acknowledged that this was a he said/she said
    situation with little, if any, independent evidence confirming or refuting the
    different versions of events given by the two witnesses. The trial judge
    acknowledged that both the complainant and appellant gave their testimony in a
    forthright manner and were unshaken in cross-examination.</span></p>

    credible witness. She found the complainant had no motive to fabricate the
    allegations and the evidence showed there was an opportunity for the assaults
    to have occurred, as described by the complainant. The trial judge also
    considered and rejected certain arguments made on behalf of the appellant. Some
    of those arguments she found to be predicated on myths about how victims
    react to sexual assaults. Others were premised on assumptions about how parents
    do and do not arrange sleeping accommodations during access visits. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    treatment of the complainants evidence. Nor did she err in her forceful
    rejection of some of the submissions made by counsel for the appellant in
    support of the contention the complainant was not a credible witness.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    judges treatment of, and outright rejection of, the appellants evidence does

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant couched his denials in tentative

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant repeatedly emphasized he had no
    relationship with the complainant, in an apparent effort to distance himself
    from the complainant;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant absolutely denied the Barbie

    with her; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant professed to have a remarkably detailed
    recollection of his fathers home, including the furnishings and where his
    father habitually sat.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are problems with each of the reasons
    advanced by the trial judge for rejecting the appellants evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9 style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants phraseology</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant used phrases like that would
    never have happened when asked about events, including the alleged sexual
    assaults. On many occasions, in the same answer, he used direct unqualified
    language in making his denials. For example, when asked whether he had any
    recollection of the incident at his fathers home, the appellant replied:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>No I do not, that would not have happened.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge offers no explanation for her
    conclusion that the appellants phraseology was indicative of a lack of
    credibility. It must be borne in mind the appellant was being asked about
    events that may or may not have occurred about 10 years earlier. Some of those
    events were not memorable. It is not surprising a witness, when asked about
    events from long ago, would, in attempting to answer honestly, not speak in
    definitive terms, but rather speak in terms of what would have or would not
    have happened. The phraseology used by the appellant from time-to-time in some
    of his answers could not reasonably offer any insight into his credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants description of his relationship
    with the complainant</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the appellant, in his
    testimony, emphasized over and over again the non-relationship that he had
    with [the complainant]. The trial judge saw this as an attempt to distance
    himself from the complainant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are two difficulties with this analysis.
    First, a reading of the transcript does not support the characterization of the
    appellants evidence as a repeated emphasis of the nature of his relationship
    with the complainant. He was asked about that relationship, just as the
    complainant was asked about it. He answered those questions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, and more importantly, the appellants
    description of his relationship with the complainant was essentially the same
    as the complainants description of the relationship. Both described the
    relationship as distant and largely non-existent, because they seldom saw each
    other, and the appellant was several years older than the complainant. The
    trial judges finding the appellant misrepresented the nature of his
    relationship with the complainant is inconsistent with the complainants
    evidence, the only other evidence about the nature of the relationship, and
    inconsistent with the trial judges finding that the complainants evidence was
    credible.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Barbie doll evidence</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As outlined above (see para. 17), the trial
    judge found the qualified or conditional nature of some of the appellants
    answers demonstrated he was not a credible witness. The trial judge took the
    opposite approach in respect of the appellants evidence about the Barbie
    doll incident. The trial judge determined that the appellants absolute
    denial he would ever go into the complainants room to speak to her while she
    was playing with her Barbie dolls indicated he was not a credible witness.
    Bearing in mind the age difference, the distant nature of the relationship
    between the appellant and complainant, and the evidence the appellant did not
    visit the complainants home very often, it is not apparent why the trial judge
    treated the appellants unqualified rejection of the suggestion he would go
    into the complainants room to speak with her while she was playing with her
    Barbie dolls as a basis for finding the appellant was not a credible witness.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-CA>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants recollection of his fathers
    home</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found it absolutely
    unbelievable the appellant would recall, some 10 years after the relevant
    events, details about his fathers home, the furnishings, and where his father sat
    to watch television. There are two difficulties with that finding. First, the
    appellants recollection was not significantly more detailed than the
    complainants recollection of the furnishings in the room. The appellant and
    complainant did disagree about the number of recliners in the living room. She
    said there were two, he said there was one. Apart from that, the descriptions
    were not dissimilar. Second, apart from the complainants evidence about the
    number of recliners in the living room, there was no evidence to suggest any of
    the other detail provided by the appellant was inaccurate. The trial judge
    simply assumed because the description was detailed, it was fabricated by the
    appellant in an effort to buttress his credibility. Based on this record,
    everything the appellant said about the house, with the exception of the number
    of recliners in the living room, may well have been entirely correct.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the Crown correctly submits that a
    trial judge is not obliged to find fault with an accuseds testimony in order
    to convict. A conviction may flow from a considered and reasoned acceptance,
    beyond a reasonable doubt of the complainants evidence: <em>R. v. J.J.R.D.</em> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252, at para. 53 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judges examination of the
    complainants evidence can be described as considered and reasoned. She did
    not, however, rest her rejection of the appellants evidence, or her ultimate
    verdicts, only on her analysis of the complainants evidence. Instead, the
    trial judge went on to reject the appellants evidence as untrue, citing four reasons
    for that determination. None of those reasons can support or justify her
    assessment. The trial judges reliance on factors that could not reasonably negatively
    impact on the appellants credibility must have played a significant role in
    her ultimate determination that, not only did she not believe the appellant,
    but his evidence did not leave her with a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is allowed. The errors in respect of
    the assessment of the appellants credibility require that the findings of guilt
    be set aside. A new trial is ordered.</span></p>
