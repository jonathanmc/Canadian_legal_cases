  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant, who has been ordered committed in
    an extradition proceeding, seeks an order for judicial interim release pending
    the Minister of Justice’s Decision on Surrender. For the reasons that follow, this
    application is denied.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>MATERIAL FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant entered the United States from the
    Republic of Ghana, his home country, on December 22, 2001. He knowingly used a
    passport and visa issued in the name of another person, Emmanuel Ampaabeng. His
    fraudulent use of the documents was not discovered for many years. Prior to
    that discovery he settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he married.
    Shortly after obtaining a green card through his wife, he and she divorced.
    While in the United States he worked, and he purchased a home under the name of
    Emmanuel Ampaabeng.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 25, 2019, after suspicion was cast
    on his identity and his fraudulent entry into the United States was discovered,
    the applicant was arrested on charges of making a false statement relating to
    naturalization, and aggravated identity theft. Together those charges carry a
    minimum penalty of two years, and a maximum of five additional years of
    imprisonment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Approximately two weeks after his arrest, the
    applicant was released on conditions without sureties, on an unsecured bond of
    $25,000. One of the reasons the court did not detain him was because of the
    applicant’s strong roots in the community, including his home and employment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 4, 2019, despite his roots in the
    community, the applicant breached the conditions of his release and fled to
    Canada, entering illegally. Eight days later, on August 12, 2019, he filed for
    refugee protection under the name of Richy Kyeremeh. He based his refugee protection
    claim on his fear that if he returns to Ghana, he will be punished by death through
    an extra-judicial killing for having declined a tribal appointment because of his
    religious objections. The refugee protection application is still outstanding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Notably, the applicant disclosed to Immigration,
    Refugees and Citizenship Canada (“IRCC”) authorities some of the circumstances
    that brought him to Canada, including that he had entered the United States
    using false documentation, settled there, and that he faces outstanding “identity
    theft and misrepresentation” charges in the United States. He told the
    authorities he came to Canada to avoid being sent back to Ghana by the
    Americans. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 28, 2019, a woman who lived in the
    applicant’s Worcester, Massachusetts home, faxed a handwritten letter to the
    American court that was processing the applicant’s charges, advising the court
    that the applicant had returned to Ghana because he could not bear what was
    going on. The information in the letter was false because by the time the
    letter was sent, the applicant was in Canada with no intention of returning to
    Ghana.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> After his entry into Canada the applicant obtained
    a work permit and settled in Brampton, Ontario, where he worked and integrated
    into the large, local Ghanaian community. Since his arrival he has complied
    with all the conditions imposed upon him by IRCC. He has made no attempt to
    hide while in Brampton, accurately notifying the Immigration authorities of his
    address, and using his actual address on his Ontario driver’s licence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On February 4, 2020, he was arrested in Brampton
    pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant for his extradition to the United
    States, obtained at the request of the United States. The applicant did not
    seek his judicial interim release on that arrest, and on June 12, 2020 a
    consent committal order was issued by Durno J. (subsequently amended on June
    17, 2020). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant has not appealed his committal,
    but applies before me, pursuant to s. 20(b) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>, S.C.
    1999, c. 18, for an order granting judicial interim release pending the
    Minister’s Decision to Surrender. The applicant contends that there is
    significant merit in his request to the Minister that he not be surrendered to
    the United States. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Relevant to those merits, the parties agree that
    the American case against the applicant is strong, and that if he is extradited,
    he will likely be convicted. In turn, if he is convicted, there is a near
    certainty he will ultimately be deported to Ghana. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the applicant contends that he has
    presented a strong case in his refugee protection claim that if he returns to
    Ghana his life will be at risk. He notes that, since he is a refugee protection
    claimant, s. 40(2) of the <i>Extradition Act</i> requires the Minister of
    Justice to consult with the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration before
    ordering his extradition. The applicant contends that given the risk he will be
    under if sent to Ghana, there is strong reason to believe that this
    consultation will trigger s. 44(1)(a) of the <i>Extradition </i>Act, which
    requires the Minister to refuse to make a surrender order if the Minister is
    satisfied that “the surrender would be unjust or oppressive having regard to
    all the relevant circumstances”.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ISSUE AND ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The only issue before me is whether the
    Applicant should be released pursuant to s. 20(b) of the <i>Extradition Act</i>,
    pending the Minister’s Decision to Surrender.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 20(b) applications incorporate the test
    for judicial interim release pending the determination of an appeal, set out in
    s. 679(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, “with any
    modifications that the circumstances require”. Section 679(3) provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><span lang=EN-CA>679 (3)</span></b><span
lang=EN-CA> In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (c),
    the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released
    pending the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><b><span lang=EN-CA>(a)</span></b><span
lang=EN-CA> the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous;</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><b><span
lang=EN-CA>(b)</span></b><span lang=EN-CA> he will surrender himself into
    custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><b><span lang=EN-CA>(c)</span></b><span
lang=EN-CA> his detention is not necessary in the public interest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Attorney General agrees that the applicant
    has met the very low threshold of showing that the issues raised in his
    submissions to the Minister are not frivolous. The Attorney General does not oppose
    the applicant’s release based on public safety concerns; the applicant has led
    a law-abiding, industrious life. Instead, the Attorney General contests the
    applicant’s release because, in the Attorney General’s view, the applicant has
    not met his s. 679(3)(b) onus of establishing that he will surrender himself
    into custody in accordance with the terms of the release order. Consequently,
    he cannot demonstrate under s.&nbsp;679(3)(c) that his surrender is not
    necessary in the public interest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In making this submission the Attorney General
    stresses that one of the modifications to s. 697(3) required in extradition
    proceedings is ensuring compliance with Canada’s international obligations: see <i>A. G. of Canada on behalf of the USA v. Mordi</i>, 2010 ONSC 6666, at para.
    4. Even in the case of refugees, given Canada’s obligations to its extradition
    partners,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Canada’s <i>non-refoulement</i> obligations do
    not displace the well-established requirement that a court considering an
    application for judicial interim release in an extradition proceeding must
    limit the assumption of risk of non-appearance more severely than might
    otherwise be acceptable in the case of an application for judicial interim
    release brought by an offender under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>See <i>Cretu v. Romania</i>, 2012 SKCA
    69, 399 Sask.R. 59, at para. 17; <i>U.S.A. v. Edwards</i>, 2010 BCCA 149, 288
    B.C.A.C. 15, at para. 18. The Attorney General asks that I bear this in mind
    when considering the public interest under s. 679(3)(c).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am not persuaded that the mode of analysis
    offered by the Attorney General is correct. Specifically, I do not believe it
    to be necessary where an applicant has failed to establish that he will
    surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of his order, to go
    on and consider the effect of his risk of flight on the public interest, under
    s. 679(3)(c). In a s. 679 application, the applicant bears the burden of
    establishing each of the three itemized release considerations, on the balance
    of probabilities, before an interim judicial release order may be made: <i>R.
    v. Oland</i>, 2017 SCC 17, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 250, at para. 19. All considerations
    relevant to flight risk can be considered under s. 679(b). This includes the
    lower flight-risk tolerance that applies where an applicant’s failure to
    surrender would frustrate the public interest in Canada’s discharge of its international
    obligations to its extradition partners. The question under s. 679(3)(b) is
    whether the applicant has established, on the balance of probabilities, that the
    likelihood that he will surrender himself into custody overcomes the concern that
    if he is released, Canada may be unable to discharge its international
    commitments to its extradition partner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The challenge for the applicant is that he has
    an established history of dishonesty directly related to his desire to avoid
    being in Ghana. He successfully acquired and used fraudulent identification to
    enter the United States under the name Emmanuel Ampaabeng, and then used that
    false identity to marry and obtain a green card. When confronted by American
    officials about his identity he lied under oath. He breached bail conditions
    that he undertook to respect and violated his bail bond, while trying to
    deceive the court about where he had fled. According to the Attorney General,
    it cannot be assured that he is indeed Richy Kyeremeh, as he currently claims. American
    authorities believe his real name is Richard Ameyaw-Akumfi Cheremeh, a name he
    told American authorities he wished to adopt as his legal name and has used in
    an email account.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant argues that three specific
    considerations should overcome this history and the flight concerns it would
    otherwise raise. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, he has been honest with Canadian
    officials from the outset that he used the false identity, Emmanuel Ampaabeng,
    to enter the United States, and that, as a result of using that false identity
    he faces outstanding American charges. He did not attempt to hide when he
    entered Canada, but instead reported his entry. He has filed a refugee protection
    application and has provided accurate and up-to-date information as to where he
    can be found. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the applicant urges that his refugee
    protection claim is strong, and the likelihood of its success reduces his
    incentive to flee before the Minister’s surrender decision. </span></p>

    strong bail release plan he proposes. Four responsible individuals from the
    Ghanaian community, three of whom attest to having known the applicant from
    Ghana, and three of whom are ministers or pastors at the applicant’s church
    community, are prepared to pledge sums that are meaningful to them, between $2,000
    and $5,000. The applicant would live with one of his sureties and would leave
    the residence only accompanied by a surety. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Attorney General does not share the
    applicant’s belief that his submissions to the Minister provide a strong basis
    for the exercise of the Minister’s discretion because the Attorney General
    contends that there are inconsistencies in the supporting material and other
    credibility concerns. The Attorney General also contends that the release plan
    is not strong, given that the applicant is not close enough to any of the
    sureties to enable them to exact moral suasion over his conduct. Even if they
    report him after he flees, which he could easily do given his ability to secure
    and use false identities, it would be too late, and Canada’s international
    commitment to the United States would be defeated or delayed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I confess to having been challenged by this
    application. The appropriate outcome is not obvious. However, in the
    circumstances I am not satisfied that the applicant has met the burden of proof
    he bears of demonstrating, on the balance of probabilities, that he will
    surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the proposed
    release order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If the applicant is extradited, he acknowledges
    that it is almost certain that he will be convicted and then deported to Ghana.
    I am not in a position to decide whether the applicant’s desire to avoid Ghana
    is based on a sincere and reasonable fear of persecution, but what cannot be
    questioned is that he is highly motivated not to go there. He has demonstrated
    that he will use fraudulent means to avoid doing so, and that he would breach
    bail at great personal expense to achieve that. He had strong personal and
    financial ties to the United States yet violated a bail release order. If he
    had to breach his bail in Canada to avoid going to Ghana, there is a real risk
    that he would do so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept that the applicant’s bail release plan
    is commendable, but I am not persuaded that it would probably prevent him from
    fleeing, if he feels the need to do so. The applicant does not have meaningful
    ties to Canada that would be apt to discourage him from violating Canadian law.
    Although he has known some of the proposed sureties for many years, his
    reacquaintance with them is recent and the amounts they have pledged may not be
    sufficient to discourage his flight.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The concerns I express are mitigated to some
    degree by the fact that the applicant surfaced after his illegal entry into
    Canada, identified himself to authorities, and brought an application for
    refugee protection in which he disclosed his time in the United States and his
    outstanding charges. However, these facts do not right the balance in the
    applicant’s favour. The applicant would have had a difficult time surviving in
    Canada without Canadian identity, which his refugee application has provided.
    If he wished to file a credible refugee application, he would have no choice
    but to provide an accurate and verifiable recent history. Although his
    application clearly exposed him to the risk of extradition, there is strong
    reason to believe that immediately after it was filed, he took steps to make
    his trial look cold to the Americans by notifying the American court that he
    had already returned to Ghana. This is not a case where I can find that the
    applicant has been entirely open in trusting his fate to the processes of law.</span></p>
