lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On a 19-count indictment, the applicant pled
    guilty to four offences, including the offences of invitation to sexual
    touching, contrary to s. 152 (count 7) and sexual interference contrary to s. 151
    (count 16), under the <em>Criminal Code</em><i>, </i>R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46. The
    other two offences were trafficking a substance included in Schedule 1
    (methamphetamine), contrary to s. 5(1) of the <em>Controlled Drugs and
    Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 19 (counts 18 and 19). </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties filed an Agreed Statement of Facts in
    relation to the four counts on the understanding the court would hear evidence
    about disputed facts pursuant to ss. 723 and 724 of the <em>Code</em>. The
    Crown called eight witnesses and the defence called two witnesses. Based on the
    Agreed Statement of Facts and his findings on the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt,
    the sentencing judge described the applicant’s offences as “a toxic mixture of
    sustained trafficking in methamphetamine to numerous adults and children, over
    prolonged periods of time, with clear evidence that the trafficking to children
    was used as a means of grooming and facilitating sexual abuse in relation to
    those children”.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge imposed a global sentence
    of six years in custody. He thought it appropriate to impose higher sentences on
    the trafficking counts than on the sexual counts because “the more pervasive methamphetamine
    trafficking activity … essentially formed the manipulative platform or tool
    used by Mr. Stone to enable his perpetration of repetitive sexual misconduct in
    relation to his numerous young victims.” He imposed custodial sentences of
    three years on each of the trafficking convictions, 20 months on the invitation
    to sexual touching conviction, and 22 months on the sexual interference
    conviction. The trafficking sentences were made consecutive to each other because
    they stemmed from “two non-overlapping periods of trafficking”. The sexual
    counts were made consecutive to each other “as they occurred at different times
    and involved different victims”. Each sentence for a sexual conviction was made
    concurrent to the trafficking conviction in the corresponding time frame. This
    resulted in a six year global sentence.</span></p>

    judge did not take into appropriate consideration the prolonged sexual abuse
    that the applicant had suffered earlier in life, and that all sentences should

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The submission counsel presses most strenuously is
    that the applicant should be granted release because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
    She has filed a lengthy affidavit from Dr. Aaron Orkin, an expert
    epidemiologist, who outlines the risks for the spread of COVID-19 in congregate
    facilities such as jails. Dr. Orkin sets out data showing that the prevalence
    of COVID-19 in Ontario correctional institutes is several magnitudes higher
    than the prevalence in the general population. He does not set out the equivalent
    data for federal institutions. He explains that jails are in the category of what
    he terms “not fully voluntary congregate settings” (NFVCS). He accepts that
    NFVCS “remain in operation because of their socially essential function”. However,
    he states that from a public health perspective it is preferable to “depopulate
    and decongregate” these settings rather than resort to secondary mitigation
    strategies. He points out that “every admission prevented, and every resident
    discharged or released, is an opportunity to flatten the curve and improve
    health for the individual involved, other inmates in the facility in question,
    staff at the facility in question, and the public.” Dr. Orkin also foresees a second
    wave of outbreaks in correctional facilities in the future should mitigation
    measures be relaxed without reducing populations. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Orkin acknowledges his perspective is from a
    “medical and population health perspective” and that “[a] judicial official … deciding
    whether or not to detain somebody will take various factors into account, and
    will have to balance public health and individual safety against factors
    outside of [his] area of expertise in determining what is in the community’s best
    interest.”  </span></p>

    three criteria of which the applicant must satisfy the court on a balance of
    probabilities to obtain release pending appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span class=lawlabel><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif;color:black'>(a)</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;the appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances, it

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span class=lawlabel><span lang=EN-CA

lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span class=lawlabel><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-family:"Helvetica",sans-serif;color:black'>(c)</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>&nbsp;his detention is not necessary in the public interest.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 679(4)(a)</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The legal test of “unnecessary hardship” under
    s. 679(4)(a) depends on the likelihood the applicant would spend more time in
    custody than his sentence is ultimately determined to be, considering the
    merits of the appeal: <em>R. v. Hassan</em>, 2017 ONCA 1008, at para. 33. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see little merit in the appeal. The sentencing
    judge discussed at length “the reality that [the applicant] himself is the
    victim of devastating prolonged and horrific sexual abuse”. It was up to him to
    weigh that circumstance. As well, there is no error in principle in the
    sentencing judge’s reasons for imposing consecutive sentences for the trafficking
    offences and for the sexual offences. The applicant supplied methamphetamine to
    17 different identifiable individuals over two distinct time periods, two of
    whom were the complainants in the <em>Criminal Code</em> offences. The applicant
    concedes that the global sentence was within the sentencing range for those
    offences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, there is little prospect that the
    appeal will result in the appellant spending more time in custody than his
    sentence is ultimately determined to be. My view is that the appeal, even if
    successful, would be determined before the term he must ultimately serve has
    expired.</span></p>

    had been charged with failing to attend court and that the charge was withdrawn
    when he pled guilty to other charges. However, she did not press the
    application of s. 679(4)(b). I am satisfied that the applicant has met his onus
    on this ground.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is in the public interest that the spread of
    COVD-19 in correctional institutions be minimized. The current COVID-19
    pandemic is a factor that is to be considered in assessing the public interest
    criterion: <em>R. v. Omitiran</em>, 2020 ONCA 261, at para. 26; <em>R. v. Jesso</em>,
    2020 ONCA 280, at para. 36. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That said, the primary responsibility for the
    safety of inmates in federal correctional institutions lies with the federal government
    and Corrections Canada. The applicant points out that the Honourable Bill
    Blair, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, on March 31, 2020,
    recommended that the Superintendent of Prisons and the Head of the Parole Board
    consider releasing inmates. The Superintendent and the Parole Board may have
    resort to special powers to grant early parole to inmates whose release will
    not pose an undue risk to the public.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In contrast to the comprehensive perspective
    Corrections Canada may take, the focus of a court is necessarily solely on the
    individual case before it and the administration of the law (in this case, s.
    679(4) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The fact is that the applicant has been
    sentenced to six years in custody in a federal penitentiary. Being on release
    for a few months now will not change the fact he must serve his sentence and may
    be serving it during the second wave of COVID-19 that Dr. Orkin foresees,
    should it occur. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the applicant is in custody at Bath
    Institution where no inmate has tested positive to date. The applicant is diabetic
    and a former smoker and says he is especially vulnerable to the virus. He
    attributes his high sugar levels to being incarcerated. The Crown has introduced
    evidence that he has consistently been purchasing from the canteen a high
    number of products high in carbohydrates such as pop, cookies, swiss rolls, and
    Fudgee-O cookies. The evidence does not satisfy me the applicant’s high sugar
    levels are attributable to his incarceration.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If, in the future, there is an outbreak of
    COVID-19 at Bath Institution, it will up to the prison authorities to take
    appropriate measures to ensure the health and safety of those who are
    incarcerated or work in the institution, as well as of the general public.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this individual case, the applicant has not satisfied
    me that his detention is not necessary in the public interest. In addition to
    the considerations noted above, the evidence shows that the applicant has
    previously breached recognizances, breaches that involved the use of drugs,
    access to a computer and the Internet and child pornography. Troubling is the
    sentencing judge’s finding the applicant has no insight into his sexual
    preference for prepubescent and pubescent individuals. His plan of release is
    weak, proposing his spouse as surety, and that he be released to live with her.
    As noted, the applicant has committed offences while on bail before, albeit not
    with his spouse as surety. The acts for which he has been sentenced are serious
    crimes against children.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having considered all the applicant’s
    submissions including those relating to COVID-19, I am not satisfied the test
    for granting release pending appeal is met. The application for release pending
    the appeal is dismissed. I order the preparation of the transcripts, if
    necessary, and the appeal to be expedited. The parties may arrange an expedited
    date with the Court’s Appeal Scheduling Unit. </span></p>
