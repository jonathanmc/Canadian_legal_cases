  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal arises out of a dispute between the
    appellant, Seahold Investments Inc., and the respondent, William First, as to
    who is entitled to settlement funds held in trust by McNally Gervan LLP for its
    client, Andre Fillion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals the motion judge’s order,
    dated April 25, 2019, that McNally Gervan pay all monies held in trust for Mr.
    Fillion to Mr. First.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal was case managed. The case
    management judge directed that Mr. First file his factum by May 11, 2020 if he
    intended to respond to the appeal, and that, if he did not do so by that date,
    the appeal would proceed before a panel in the absence of responding materials.
    Mr. First did not file a factum, and this appeal has accordingly proceeded in
    writing without the benefit of submissions from Mr. First. Counsel for McNally
    Gervan advised the case management judge that McNally Gervan would not be
    participating in the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Background </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2009, Mr. Fillion sustained injuries in a
    slip and fall accident. He commenced an action against the owner and occupier
    of the premises where the accident occurred. Mr. First – Mr. Fillion’s then
    common law partner – was also a plaintiff in the action. He claimed damages in
    the amount of $25,000 for “loss of care, guidance and companionship” pursuant
    to s. 45 of the <em>Family Law Act</em>, R.S.O., 1990, c. F.3, and special
    damages in an unspecified amount for out-of-pocket expenses and loss of income.
    Mr. Fillion retained McNally Gervan to act for him and Mr. First. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship between Mr. Fillion and Mr.
    First broke down and, on April 28, 2013, they entered into an agreement (the
    “Agreement”) to settle all financial matters arising from the termination of
    their relationship. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Paragraph 4(b) of the Agreement arose out of the
    accident and required Mr. Fillion to pay Mr. First “One-Hundred and Twenty
    thousand dollars for extraordinary care provided to Andre Fillion and income
    forfeited as a result of providing that care”. Paragraph 5 of the Agreement
    provided that, “Should Andre Fillion make any successful insurance claims or
    obtain any settlement funds from any parties found liable for the personal
    injury which brought about the need for extraordinary care and complications to
    the spousal relationship, any amount claimed therein for the re-imbursement of
    William First will be deducted from the monies referred to in 4(b)”. Paragraph 6
    provided that monies payable under the Agreement became due and payable,
    without interest, on the later of September 1, 2015 or “the day on which all
    claims made by Andre Fillion for compensation for losses sustained by his
    personal injury are resolved or settled”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no evidence before the motion judge of
    when or if McNally Gervan received notice of the Agreement. The affidavit of
    Mr. First indicates that McNally Gervan was made aware of Mr. Fillion’s debt to
    Mr. First in October of 2017, but there is no indication that McNally Gervan
    was made aware of the language of the Agreement or any possible equitable
    assignment to Mr. First. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is a litigation financer and
    provided funds to Mr. Fillion to permit him to pursue the litigation. Between
    May of 2013 and June of 2014, Mr. Fillion signed the first of several
    promissory notes in favour of the appellant and Irrevocable Directions to Frank
    McNally of McNally Gervan. The Irrevocable Directions required Mr. McNally to
    pay any and all sums owing to the appellant “immediately upon receipt by
    him/her or his/her law firm of all or any portion of the Settlement Funds and
    to make the aforesaid payment in priority to any other payment out of the
    Settlement Funds, saving and excepting any payment to my solicitor or his/her
    law firm”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The promissory notes and Irrevocable Directions
    were faxed to McNally Gervan within days of being signed by Mr. Fillion.
    McNally Gervan was also sent monthly statements setting out the amount
    outstanding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In August 2017, the action settled for $150,000,
    all inclusive. On August 23, 2017, Mr. Fillion and Mr. First signed an
    Authorization &amp; Direction to McNally Gervan, instructing it to settle for
    $150,000, all inclusive, and acknowledging that their net amount would be $90,000
    to $95,000 after disbursements, legal fees and HST, and that from that amount,
    $12,000 would be allocated to Mr. First and the balance to Mr. Fillion. Mr.
    Fillion also acknowledged that he had loans with the appellant that he was
    responsible to pay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 7, 2017, Mr. First commenced an
    action against Mr. Fillion, to enforce the payment obligation in the Agreement.
    On the consent of Mr. Fillion, he obtained judgment against Mr. Fillion in the
    amount of $185,000. Mr. First then issued and served McNally Gervan with a
    Notice of Garnishment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response, McNally Gervan brought a motion
    under rules 60.08(16) and 43 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>, R.R.O
    1990, Reg. 194, seeking a garnishment hearing or interpleader order to
    determine its liabilities with respect to Mr. First, the appellant, Mr.
    Fillion, and another litigation financer, Settlement Lenders Inc., in relation
    to the settlement funds balance of $78,000 it held in trust. The appellant was
    a respondent to McNally Gervan’s motion, as both an interested person to the
    garnishment, and as a claimant to the interpleader. It also brought its own
    motion seeking payment of the settlement funds. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neither Mr. Fillion nor Settlement Lenders Inc.
    filed materials or attended the motions.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge’s reasons</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In brief oral reasons, the motion judge
    commented that the Agreement “could certainly have been drafted more clearly”
    but that “the agreement does indicate that the monies owed were to come from
    any settlement of the action”.  She concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is apparent that Mr. Fillion and Mr. First
    believed that any settlement would be large enough that everyone would be paid.
    Unfortunately, that did not turn out to be the case. As the agreement with Mr.
    First was executed first, it stands first in line for the funds. Consequently
    McNally Gerv[an] are ordered to pay all the monies they hold in trust to Mr.
    First. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge ordered that there be no costs
    awarded for the motions.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge did not make an express finding
    that the Agreement and the Irrevocable Directions constituted equitable
    assignments of the settlement funds. However, it is implicit from the manner in
    which she resolved the priority issue that she considered both to be equitable
    assignments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the motion judge
    failed to consider binding authority from this court as to what is required to
    make an equitable assignment and that her interpretation of the Agreement and
    the Irrevocable Directions is accordingly not owed deference. It submits that,
    considering the applicable jurisprudence, only the Irrevocable Directions are
    equitable assignments, and, therefore, the appellant has priority. In the
    alternative, relying on <em>Bank of Montreal v. Union Gas Co. of Canada Ltd.</em> (1969), 7 D.L.R. (3d) 25 (C.A.), citing <em>Dearle v. Hall</em> (1828), 38 E.R.
    475, it submits that the motion judge erred by determining priority by the
    order of execution of the Agreement and the Irrevocable Directions, rather than
    by considering the order of notice given to McNally Gervan.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We agree with the appellant that the motion
    judge erred by failing to consider what is required to make an equitable
    assignment and that, having regard to what is required, only the Irrevocable
    Directions are equitable assignments. The appellant, as an equitable assignee
    based on the Irrevocable Directions, has priority over Mr. First, as a judgment
    creditor. Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider whether, as the
    appellant argues, when the funds at issue have not been paid over, priority of
    equitable assignments is determined by the order of notice given to the person
    holding the funds, rather than by the order of the assignments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court has described the law of equitable
    assignment as follows, in <em>Thibodeau v. Thibodeau</em><i>, </i>2011 ONCA
    110, 104 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 57, citing the House of Lords in <em>Swiss
    Bank Corp. v. Lloyds Bank Ltd.</em><i>, </i>[1981] 2 All E.R. 449 (H.L.), at p.
    453, quoting <em>Rodick v. Gandell</em><i> </i>(1852), 42 E.R. 749, at p. 754: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>an agreement between a debtor and a creditor
    that the debt owing shall be paid out of a specific fund coming to the debtor,
    or an order given by the debtor to his creditor upon a person owing money or
    holding funds belonging to the giver of the order, directing such person to pay
    such funds to the creditor, will create a valid equitable charge upon such
    fund, in other words, will operate as an equitable assignment of the debts or
    fund to which the order refers. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Equity does not require a particular form to
    effect a valid assignment. But whatever form is used must <span
class=Underline>clearly</span> show an intention that the assignee is to have
    the benefit of the debt or chose in action assigned: <em>Nadeau v. Caparelli</em>,
    2016 ONCA 730, 132 O.R. (3d) 729, at para. 19. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge did not consider the
    requirement that the Agreement must <span class=Underline>clearly</span> show
    an intention that Mr. First was to have the benefit of the settlement funds. Indeed,
    she found that the Agreement “could certainly have been drafted more clearly”.
    We agree with the motion judge that the Agreement does not clearly show an
    intention that Mr. First was to have the benefit of the settlement funds.
    Rather, it provides that the monies payable under the Agreement became due and
    payable on the later of September 15, 2015 or “the day on which all claims made
    by Andre Fillion for compensation for losses sustained by his personal injury
    are resolved or settled”. If the action settled before September 15, 2015, Mr.
    Fillion had the benefit of the settlement funds. The Agreement did not direct
    him to pay the monies he owed Mr. First out of the settlement funds. </span></p>

    Funds and to make the aforesaid payment in priority to any other payment out of
    the Settlement Funds, saving and excepting any payment to my solicitor or
