  <h1><strong><span lang=EN-CA>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></strong></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant physician appeals from an award of
    damages against him for negligent management of a twin pregnancy following a
    jury trial. He does not challenge the jury finding that he did not meet the
    standard of care, but he submits that the jury verdict on causation was
    unreasonable. He says there was a critical gap in the evidence on causation. He
    says further, that the trial judge ought to have instructed the jury that it
    could draw an adverse inference against the respondents because they did not
    call a witness to deal with the gap the appellant identifies in the evidence.
    He submits that the charge to the jury was inadequate, unbalanced and contained
    errors. He submits that, although the trial judge’s instruction on causation
    was legally correct, the trial judge erred in failing to further explain that a
    mere loss of chance to avoid an injury that does not satisfy the “but for” test
    does not establish causation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept these arguments and would
    dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Factual background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Booth was pregnant with twins. She saw the
    appellant for an unscheduled appointment on July 5, 1991, as she was
    experiencing severe abdominal pain and excessive weight gain. The appellant
    sent her home to rest. When the symptoms became worse, she went to Niagara
    Hospital on July 7 which arranged for her immediate transfer by ambulance to
    McMaster Hospital. By then, her cervix was two or three centimetres dilated.
    Doctors there delivered the babies by emergency C-section at 27 weeks into the
    pregnancy. As a result of the premature birth, one of the twins, Kelsey Woods,
    sustained brain damage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury found that the appellant was negligent
    for, among other things, failing to arrange for her to be seen immediately by a
    perinatologist – a fetal medicine specialist – on July 5. The theory of the respondents’
    case was that if she had been seen on July 5, 1991 by specialists at a tertiary
    center with expertise in high-risk pregnancies, like McMaster Hospital, then the
    Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (“TTTS”) imperilling the babies would have
    been detected and treated, and the premature delivery and the brain damage to
    Ms. Woods would have been avoided.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>TTTS is a rare complication of twin pregnancies.
    One twin gets too much fluid, while the other gets too little. The twin getting
    excess fluid continues to urinate, creating a large volume of amniotic fluid
    around it. This large volume of fluid compresses the other twin who gets less and
    less fluid. Untreated, this condition is usually fatal for both. The respondents’
    experts testified that there was effectively only one treatment in 1991:
    amnioreduction, a procedure where a needle is inserted into the amniotic cavity
    to remove some of the excess fluid. If this was not possible, the only other
    option was an emergency C-section, which at this gestational age could have
    catastrophic consequences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The matter went to trial in 2019. It was a
    two-issue case:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the appellant breach the standard of care?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>If yes, did his breach of the standard of care cause the brain
    damage that Ms. Woods sustained because of her premature birth? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury answered, “yes”, to both questions. As
    indicated above, the appellant does not challenge the jury’s conclusion that he
    breached the standard of care and limits his appeal to issues related to
    causation. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence and arguments relating to the respondents’
    theory of causation</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Booth would have gone to McMaster Hospital,
    at least initially, had she been referred to specialists on July 5. The
    causation issues related to the availability of effective treatment for TTTS at
    McMaster Hospital at that time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Barrett, an expert in management of twin
    pregnancies called by the respondents, testified that removal of excess fluid
    from the amniotic cavity was “not a complicated procedure” and that “</span>[a]ny
    maternal-fetal medicine should do it.” <span lang=EN-CA>He said it was first
    developed in the 1940s and became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. If for some
    reason McMaster Hospital could not do it in order to treat TTTS, the patient
    could have been sent to Toronto for the procedure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Barrett testified that in 40% of cases, this
    procedure would resolve the TTTS entirely, and allow the pregnancy to continue
    normally to term. In other cases, it would prolong the pregnancy, allow the
    twins more time to develop, and allow effective use of steroids. The use of the
    procedure would have immediate beneficial effect. Dr. Barrett testified that
    amnioreduction was a “standard” treatment of TTTS in 1991, noting, “We were
    doing it all the time and I think the evidence is pretty clear that we knew it
    got better results than doing nothing.” Dr. Barrett disagreed when it was
    suggested to him that the appellant’s expert Dr. Mundle would say that there
    was limited availability of amnioreduction, and that Ms. Booth would not have had
    the treatment if she had been referred to McMaster Hospital on July 5. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Barrett testified that TTTS develops rapidly
    and that the mother’s presentation on July 5 would have been materially
    different from her condition on July 7. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Barrett testified that had amnioreduction
    been performed on July 5, the pregnancy would have been prolonged by about 5
    weeks, and in addition there was a further 40% likelihood that the TTTS would
    have resolved completely. According to other expert evidence, a five-week
    extension of the pregnancy would have avoided the brain damage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Farine, another expert for the respondents, testified
    that in Hamilton “they did amnios all the time”, though he did not have direct
    knowledge of whether McMaster Hospital did amnioreduction to treat TTTS at the
    time. He testified that amnioreduction was generally used to treat pregnancies
    where the “baby had too much fluid on board”. When counsel put to him that Dr.
    Mundle would say that Ms. Booth would not have received amnioreduction if
    referred on July 5 or earlier because there was limited availability of
    amnioreduction in 1991, Dr. Farine disagreed. Dr. Farine responded, </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]f you’re
    perinatologist and you have two hands, you can do an amniocentesis. So each one
    of the perinatologists and probably some of the generalist[s] in Mac could have
    done it… So in the 1991 there was no reason not to embark on it and it’s easy
    to do…</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s expert, Dr. Mundle, ultimately
    said that his “feeling” was that McMaster Hospital did not offer amnioreduction
    for TTTS at that time. He explained that when he arrived in Ontario in 1997,
    McMaster Hospital was not doing it. However, by 1997 laser treatment for this
    condition had become available and was a more effective treatment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant distinguishes withdrawal of
    amniotic fluid for diagnostic purposes, amniocentesis, and withdrawal of
    amniotic fluid in single-baby pregnancies where there is too much fluid, from
    amnioreduction to treat TTTS. He submits that neither Dr. Farine nor Dr.
    Barrett were able to opine as to whether this treatment for TTTS was available
    at McMaster Hospital on July 5, 1991. Dr. Farine was familiar only with the
    practices at his own hospital. Dr. Barrett came to Canada after 1991, and when
    asked if he knew whether McMaster Hospital was offering the treatment for TTTS,
    he responded, “I don’t know exactly. I wasn’t working there. … I would assume
    it could’ve - it would’ve been. It’s not a complicated procedure. Any
    maternal-fetal medicine should do it.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that without evidence from
    someone at McMaster Hospital that amnioreduction was available there for
    treatment of TTTS, the respondents’ case on causation had to fail. He says this
    absence of evidence amounted to a fatal gap in the respondents’ case and made
    the jury verdict on causation unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant introduced expert evidence
    supporting his position, but the jury did not accept that evidence. Since the
    appellant challenges the jury verdict on the ground that it was unreasonable,
    the focus on appeal is on whether there was evidence which could support the
    jury’s decision. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The jury answers on causation</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury answered “yes” to the question, “If
    your answer to question 1 (a) [was there a breach of the standard of care?] is
    YES, have the plaintiffs satisfied you on the balance of probabilities that,
    but for the breach of the standard of care, [Ms. Woods] would not have
    sustained brain damage?”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response to the further question, “how did [the
    appellant’s] breach of the standard of care cause [Ms. Woods’s] brain damage?”,
    the jury responded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We recognize that the breach of the standard
    of care may not be the sole, exclusive, or entire cause of the brain damage.
    However, we do believe there is a causal link between the breach in standard of
    care and the brain damage. The breach is Dr. Jackowitz [sic] failure to refer
    Ms. Booth to a perinatalogist [sic] or consult a perinatalogist [sic] on July
    5th.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In consequence,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>- she did not receive specialist perinatal
    care in a timely fashion.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>- this would have included an earlier

    do not fine-comb jury answers but accord them the respect of a common sense

    always timely to be reminded that juries do not write reasons for judgment, and
    their answers must be taken against the background of the evidence from which
    they are entitled to select, without manifesting their selection, what is
    credible, what is significant, what is persuasive to them. It is very often
    easy for an appellate Court, in the leisurely scrutiny of the transcript, to
    find significance in pieces of evidence to contradict jury findings, and in so
    doing to usurp the jury’s function. What an appellate Court may believe from a
    reading of the transcript may be the very things which a jury disbelieved or believed
    in part only. It is one thing to interfere with a jury’s verdict where there is
    simply no evidence to support its findings or to support a critical one; it is
    a different thing, and not to be encouraged, to interfere with its findings
    where there is evidence, however slight, on which they may be based, but where
    because of offsetting evidence a question of credit and weight arises. These

    Booth been referred to McMaster Hospital on July 5, 1991, amnioreduction would
    have been performed to effectively treat the TTTS. McMaster Hospital was a
    tertiary centre specializing in high-risk or problem pregnancies. The jury
    could infer that the easy-to-perform treatment would have been administered,
    given that there was no other treatment available other than a potentially
    catastrophic early C-section. The respondents’ experts provided a basis from
    which the jury could infer that the TTTS would have been successfully treated at
    McMaster Hospital in 1991. The jury rejected the appellant’s expert’s “feeling”
    that amnioreduction was not offered at that time at McMaster Hospital. There
    may have been any number of reasons why the jury preferred the evidence of the respondents’
    experts. It was open to them to do so and conclude that the treatment would have

    that it was actually being performed there at that time to treat TTTS. Similarly,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge misdescribed Dr. Barrett’s evidence
    as being that “[a]mnioreduction was available at the time”, when his actual
    opinion was that McMaster Hospital could have and should have performed
    amnioreduction in 1991, not that it would do so. The appellant asserts these
    statements were misleading and do not reflect the fact that neither expert was
    present at McMaster Hospital and they could not directly attest to whether

    about 1.5 hours. The jury charge was given the day after submissions. The trial
    judge told the jury, “we have heard two very thorough, well-prepared, very
