    appeal from the judgments of Justice Wendy Matheson of the Superior Court of
    Justice, dated December 11, 2018, with reasons reported at <span
style='color:black'>2018 ONSC 7278</span>.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Nogueras purchased Unit 210 in Muskoka
    Condominium Corporation No. 22 (“the Condominium”), a lakeside condominium
    development, in May 2014. In February 2016 their immediate neighbour, Don
    Mitchell, advised them that Unit 211 was to be sold. The Nogueras were
    interested in purchasing, but only if they could make an opening from their
    unit into the adjoining unit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before making an offer on Unit 211 and without
    committing to buy it, Mr. Noguera asked the Condominium’s board of directors
    for permission to make the alterations. This request was addressed at the board
    meeting on March 25, 2016. Mr. Noguera was then a director as was Mr. Mitchell,
    the seller of Unit 211. Mr. Mitchell absented himself from the meeting but Mr.
    Noguera remained. The board approved the proposal with several conditions. Mr.
    Noguera did not vote on the proposal. We note in passing that with respect to
    Unit 211, Mr. Noguera was not an owner, and the board could have refused his
    request to consider the proposal. But it proceeded as it was entitled to do.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The minutes of the meeting were set out in the
    application judge’s decision at para. 9. The board imposed seven conditions on
    the approval, set out by the application judge at para. 54: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the unit owner pay all the costs;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the alteration not affect the use and
    enjoyment of other unit owners;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the alteration not affect the symmetry of
    the building;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the alteration not affect the Condominium’s
    budget;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that all the necessary engineering and town
    approval be given before the work commenced;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the wall be returned to its existing state
    if the unit owner (Mr. Noguera) was to sell one of the units and at no cost to
    the Condominium; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(7)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the
    two units “could never be sold as one unit.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 98 of the <i>Condominium Act, 1998</i>,</span><i><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>S.O. 1998, c.
    19<i> </i>(“<i>Condominium Act</i>”) </span><span lang=EN-CA>required the
    Condominium to enter into and register on the title to the units an agreement
    with the Nogueras before they <em><span style='font-style:normal'>made “an
    addition, alteration or improvement to the common elements.” Consistent with
    its long-standing past practice, the Condominium neglected to do so.</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>The respondent
    Nogueras provided the property manager with a copy of the plans in April 2016.
    They showed an opening on the main floor and a door on the second. The Condominium
    gave a letter to the Town on June 6, 2016, confirming the board’s approval and
    stating that “All conditions have been met to the [b]oard’s satisfaction.”</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the board’s approval, the Nogueras bought
    the adjoining unit.  They signed an offer to purchase on June 16, 2016 and the
    transaction closed in August 2016.  Renovations began in the summer of 2017 and
    were completed in early 2018. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The membership of the board of directors changed,
    and the new board sought to unravel all that had gone before regarding the two
    units owned by the Nogueras, largely on the basis that there was no s. 98
    agreement covering the alterations. The new president of the board also advised
    the Nogueras that they could not use the lakeside path based on unproven
    allegations of window peeping.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The controversy between the parties alerted the
    Condominium board to a problem. The evidence was that the Condominium had
    consistently neglected to enter into agreements required by s. 98 of the <em>Condominium
    Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, from the Nogueras or from anyone
    else who had made “an addition, alteration or improvement to the common
    elements”. </span></em>The application judge noted, at para. 10, that “[m]ost
    of the unit owners had previously made structural changes, and none had been required
    to enter into the statutorily-required s. 98 agreement.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The board decided to validate retrospectively
    the changes made by unit owners by what was termed “blanket” s. 98 agreements. The
    Nogueras agreed to sign a s. 98 agreement and were told that others who had
    made structural changes would sign one too. The s. 98 agreements provided to
    the affected unit owners were identical, except for the one provided to the
    Nogueras. Their s. 98 agreement, as proposed by the Condominium board contained
    the following additional language in clause 5: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Improvements
    shall be removed by the Unit Owner, at the Unit Owner's sole expense, before
    the Unit is sold. Specifically, the Unit shall be restored to the condition
    before the Improvements were made, <i>including but not limited to the
    reinstallation of the common element demising wall within the Unit and any
    changes that were made by the Unit Owner related thereto</i>. [Emphasis added
    by application judge.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two board meetings were held without notice to Mr.
    Noguera even though he was a director.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Nogueras brought an application under s. 135
    of the <em>Condominium Act</em> for an oppression remedy on the basis that they
    were “targeted” after their relationship with members of the new board began to
    break down: at para. 23. The indicia were described by the application judge,
    at para. 72, and signal considerable animosity on the part of some members of
    the new board towards the Nogueras, who consequently asked for the following
    relief: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the Condominium be foreclosed from
    re-opening the approval process as it has requested in its cross-application;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the operative s. 98 agreement be that
    proposed by the applicants;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the applicants may use the lakeside path
    again; and,</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that the
    applicants receive damages for their loss of enjoyment of their property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response, the Condominium sought extensive
    relief. The relief sought, which the application judge outlined at para. 75,
    included: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>a cease and desist
    order regarding the structural change (even though the work has been
    completed), more plans (even though the plans were provided long ago), consent
    to obtain the Town’s files (even though it confirmed to the Town that its
    conditions had been met long ago), written consent of the current Board, unit
    owner approval by two-thirds vote, its version of the s. 98 agreement, the
    right to impose more conditions and require changes at the applicants’ expense
    and numerous other orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge dismissed the Condominium’s
    cross-application, and granted the Nogueras’ oppression application, in part,
    on the following terms: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

    the Respondent approved changes to the demising wall between suite 210 and 211

    demising wall should be removed by the Unit Owner, at the Unit Owner’s sole

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge, at para. 83,
    canvassed the instances of oppressive behaviour by the Condominium at some
    length:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Condominium proceeded in breach of its
    governance obligations by holding board meetings without proper notice. The
    Condominium proceeded as if it had little or no responsibility for the
    circumstances giving rise to the disputed approval and that stance was taken
    even in oral argument before me. There is no doubt that the Condominium was
    responsible for a great deal of what happened here, most notably for an illegal
    past practice regarding s. 98 agreements that was in place before the
    applicants even became unit owners. The approach taken with these unit owners,
    as if the Condominium had little or no role in the prior events, was harsh and
    unfair. This is in stark contrast to the approach taken with other unit owners
    who had also made structural changes with now admittedly defective approvals. I
    recognize that there was a range of types of structural changes, and opening
    the demising wall had not been done before, but the s. 98 requirement applies
    to all of the changes. The Condominium treated the applicants more harshly than
    the other unit owners. Associated conduct by Board members shows targeting and
    ill will toward the applicants. Bearing everything in mind in the exercise of
    my discretion, I would foreclose the Condominium’s requested orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She found, at para. 73, “that the Condominium
    wrongly disparaged the applicants, especially [Mr. Noguera], wrongly excluded
    them from use of common elements, specifically the path, and wrongly fostered
    an atmosphere that made them uncomfortable.” She made the finding, at para. 77,
    that the particular form of s. 98 agreement to which the Condominium would accede
    was “abusive and unfair, and prejudicial” to the Nogueras. She concluded, on
    the evidence, that the requirements of the oppression remedy under s. 135 had
    been met. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s view was so strong that
    she added, at para. 81:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have found that the 2016 approval process
    was not deficient and the Condominium is therefore not entitled to reopen or
    revisit that approval or require that the applicants restore the demising wall
    other than in connection with a sale. However, if I am wrong and there were
    defects, I would grant the applicants’ request that the Condominium be
    foreclosed from its requested relief of essentially restarting the approval
    process now. I would make that order under s. 135 of the Act.</span></p>

    argues that Mr. Noguera had a conflict of interest and could not be counted in

    the meeting at which the alteration proposal was approved lacked a quorum. Although

    43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The change was to
    an interior wall. It would not be used by and was not even visible to anyone
    outside of these two units. There was no financial impact on the Condominium.
    The applicants were paying for the work. The common expenses and other
    financial obligations of each of # 210 and # 211 would not be reduced or
    eliminated. There was no impact on the Condominium’s insurance. I find that the
    proposed transaction was properly described in the minutes as a “minor
    alteration” from the standpoint of the Condominium.</span></p>

    argument, largely based on the cost of the alteration, that “the proposed
    transaction is material to it, in hindsight”: at para. 42. The cost was
    initially estimated at between $6,000 and $8,000, but once the Town imposed its
    requirements that the doors in the openings be fire-rated, the cost climbed to
    about $32,000.</span></p>

    incurred rather than on the initial estimate. She found, at para. 44, that “in
    financial terms, it was not material to the Condominium at the time it was
    approved, and the Condominium has not established that hindsight should control
    the analysis in this case.” We agree.</span></p>

    could be available to the Nogueras to retrospectively validate and ratify their
    alterations. The terms required by the application judge in her order would
    comply with s. 98(2), and save harmless the Condominium.</span></p>

    that the court has no business making an order prescribing the terms of the s.
    98 agreement. The parties should be left to negotiate the terms of the
    agreement with the Condominium retaining its complete discretion. We reject
    this argument. The application judge provided relief from oppression, a remedy
    that is broad and flexible. The application judge described in para. 83 an
    attitude on the Condominium’s part that “<span style='color:black'>shows
    targeting and ill will”. The Condominium had provided s. 98 agreements to the
    other unit owners who had completed alterations but the one prepared for the
    Nogueras to sign was both onerous and different. It is not surprising that the
    application judge declined to give effect to the Condominium’s argument. The
    evidence supporting her view is overwhelming. The application judge’s remedy
    served to rectify the Condominium’s oppressive conduct, which seeped through
    all its actions, including its approach to this litigation. The Condominium’s real
    interests were entirely protected by the s. 98 agreement ordered by the application
    judge, which simply incorporated the conditions imposed when the Board originally
    approved the Nogueras’ proposal. </span></span></p>
