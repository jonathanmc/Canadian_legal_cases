    of second-degree murder, returned on February 2, 2017 by a jury presided over

    sentence imposed on March 2, 2017 and reported at 2017 ONSC 1441.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the afternoon of August 30, 2012, the
    appellant repeatedly stabbed Cory Fleetwood at Mr. Fleetwood’s home in
    Peterborough. Mr. Fleetwood had invited the appellant to come from Toronto for
    a visit. Mr. Fleetwood died from his wounds.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with second-degree
    murder. He admitted killing Mr. Fleetwood. He claimed he acted in self-defence
    and did not mean to kill Mr. Fleetwood or cause him serious bodily harm that he
    knew was likely to cause Mr. Fleetwood’s death. The evidence also gave rise to
    the defence of provocation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury convicted the appellant of second-degree
    murder. The trial judge imposed a life sentence with no parole eligibility for
    13 years. The appellant appealed conviction and sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the conviction appeal, the appellant advanced
    five grounds. Two alleged misstatements of parts of the evidence by the trial
    judge, and in one instance by the Crown. The other grounds of appeal alleged
    misdirection in the jury instructions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentence appeal focused on the trial judge’s
    finding the appellant was the aggressor in the confrontation with Mr.
    Fleetwood.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the end of oral argument, the court advised
    counsel the conviction appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow. The court
    reserved judgment on the sentence appeal. These reasons set out the basis upon
    which both the conviction and sentence appeals are dismissed.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the evidence</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 30, 2012, the appellant travelled from
    his home in Toronto to Peterborough to visit Mr. Fleetwood. They had known each
    other since they were teenagers and got together from time-to-time to drink and
    play video games.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant arrived at Mr. Fleetwood’s home
    around 2:00 p.m. They set up their Xbox consoles, had a few drinks and smoked
    some marihuana. The appellant described himself as “buzzed”, but not drunk. A
    short time later, Mr. Fleetwood lay dead in his bedroom, having suffered 30
    knife wounds, several of which were potentially fatal. The appellant had fled
    Mr. Fleetwood’s home and made his way back to Toronto. Mr. Fleetwood’s body was
    not found until four days later on September 3, 2012.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Fleetwood and the appellant were the only
    people in Mr. Fleetwood’s home when the appellant killed Mr. Fleetwood. The
    only direct evidence of what happened came from the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified, while he and Mr.
    Fleetwood were playing video games and chatting, he mentioned to Mr. Fleetwood
    his house was very cluttered and messy. The appellant meant nothing by the
    comment, but Mr. Fleetwood took offence. He told the appellant the “stuff”
    cluttering his home belonged to his deceased father. The appellant assured Mr.
    Fleetwood he had not intended to disrespect his father.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the appellant, Mr. Fleetwood went
    into the kitchen and returned with a large kitchen knife. He scratched the
    appellant’s Xbox. The appellant responded by grabbing Mr. Fleetwood’s hard
    drive and slamming it to the floor. The appellant decided it was time to leave
    and went upstairs to retrieve his bag and cellphone. His cellphone was charging
    in Mr. Fleetwood’s bedroom.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the appellant was leaving Mr. Fleetwood’s
    bedroom with his cellphone, Mr. Fleetwood confronted him at the door. He was
    angry and yelling at the appellant. The appellant pushed Mr. Fleetwood and he
    tripped and fell to the floor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Fleetwood got up and came aggressively toward
    the appellant, swinging at him. The appellant was still standing in Mr.
    Fleetwood’s bedroom. He put his right hand up to block what he thought was a
    punch coming from Mr. Fleetwood. In fact, Mr. Fleetwood had the large knife in
    the hand he was swinging toward the appellant. The appellant instinctively
    grabbed the knife blade with his right hand, as it came toward him. He suffered
    a deep cut between his thumb and forefinger. The appellant went to the hospital
    in Toronto later that night and received ten stitches to close the wound.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified when he grabbed the
    blade of the knife, he immediately felt intense pain. He could not, however,
    let go of the blade as he feared Mr. Fleetwood would stab him. They wrestled on
    the floor of the bedroom. The struggle went on and intensified. The appellant
    could not remember many of the details but did recall poking Mr. Fleetwood in
    the eye and eventually gaining control of the knife with his left hand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant swung the knife with his left hand
    in Mr. Fleetwood’s direction. He also made stabbing motions toward Mr.
    Fleetwood. According to the appellant, his eyes were closed most of the time.
    He was in extreme pain from the cut on his hand, overwhelmed by the
    circumstances, and very afraid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant knew he struck Mr. Fleetwood in
    the chest with the knife at least once. He could not say how many times he hit
    him with the knife, or where those blows landed on Mr. Fleetwood.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not know exactly how the
    struggle with Mr. Fleetwood ended. He was able to make his way from the bedroom
    to the bathroom. He closed the door in an effort to get away from Mr.
    Fleetwood. The appellant believed Mr. Fleetwood was still alive, because he heard
    him make “gurgling” sounds in the bedroom. The appellant passed out in the
    bathroom. When he regained consciousness, he washed his hands and placed a
    facecloth around the cut on his right hand. He tried to clean up the blood in
    the bathroom using water and cleaning products he found in the bathroom. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant next returned to the bedroom and
    saw Mr. Fleetwood’s body lying on the floor. He appeared to be dead. There was
    blood everywhere. The appellant made no effort to determine whether Mr.
    Fleetwood was dead or alive.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not call 911 or otherwise seek
    any help. Instead, he set about cleaning up the blood in the bedroom, hallway
    and bathroom using water and cleaning products. There was evidence from which
    it could be inferred the appellant showered, although he denied doing so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant put various bloodstained items,
    including Mr. Fleetwood’s Xbox, his cellphone, the appellant’s own clothing,
    and blood-soaked towels, into two garbage bags and a smaller bag. The appellant
    took the bags with him when he left Mr. Fleetwood’s home. As he headed to the
    bus station, he dropped the bags full of the bloodied material beside other
    garbage bags on the curb awaiting garbage pick-up.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant acknowledged in his evidence he
    attempted to clean up his blood at the scene and removed various bloodied items
    from the residence. When asked why he did so, he replied:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Cuz my blood was on it…because I was scared, I
    was confused, and I just didn’t want no part of what just happened.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant returned to Toronto. He lied to
    his ex-girlfriend about his whereabouts that afternoon. He lied to his brother
    about the cause of the injury on his hand. He repeated that lie to the doctor
    who stitched him up that night at a Toronto hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The large kitchen knife used to kill Mr.
    Fleetwood was found about four feet from his body. DNA testing linked blood on
    the blade and the handle to the appellant. DNA testing also linked blood found
    on the knife to Mr. Fleetwood. The copious amounts of blood in the bedroom were
    linked to Mr. Fleetwood only.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the defence case rested on the testimony
    of the appellant, the Crown’s case relied on the evidence of the number,
    location, and nature of the wounds inflicted on Mr. Fleetwood by the appellant,
    and the appellant’s conduct after he killed Mr. Fleetwood. I have summarized
    his after-the-fact conduct. The Crown argued the appellant’s failure to call
    for help, his attempt to clean up the scene, his flight, his removal of
    material evidence from the scene, and the lies he told to various people were
    all consistent with the appellant having unlawfully killed Mr. Fleetwood, and
    inconsistent with the appellant’s claim he acted in self-defence. The trial
    judge instructed the jury the after-the-fact conduct, although relevant to
    whether the appellant acted in self-defence, could not assist the jury in
    differentiating between murder and manslaughter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence about the many wounds suffered by
    Mr. Fleetwood came primarily from Dr. Rose who performed the post-mortem. She
    located 30 wounds, all consistent with having been inflicted by a sharp knife.
    Mr. Fleetwood had wounds on his face, head, hands, the front and back of his
    torso, and his arms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Rose explained she followed the usual protocol
    in describing the many wounds suffered by Mr. Fleetwood. She characterized all
    of the wounds as “sharp force injuries”, meaning injuries inflicted by an
    object that had a pointed tip and a sharp edge. A sharp knife is the most
    common example of a weapon that causes “sharp force injuries”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Rose divided the sharp force injuries into
    two categories. One category, incised wounds, consists of wounds that are
    longer than they are deep. Incised wounds are inflicted with a slashing motion.
    They are not, however, necessarily “shallow” wounds. By definition, they are
    longer than deep, meaning a long incised wound might also be quite deep. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second category of wounds, stab wounds, are
    wounds that are deeper than they are long. Those wounds are inflicted with a
    thrusting or stabbing motion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Rose testified the decomposition of Mr.
    Fleetwood’s body made it difficult to characterize some of the wounds as
    incised or stab wounds. She also indicated the decomposition of the body and
    the number of wounds to the torso made it impossible to match specific wounds on

    Crown and the trial judge to “30 stab wounds” amounted to a serious misstatement
    of Dr. Rose’s evidence. The appellant argues, on Dr. Rose’s evidence, only some
    of the knife wounds were stab wounds. As outlined above, Dr. Rose described all
    30 knife wounds as “sharp force injuries”, some of which she characterized as
    incised wounds (longer than deeper); some she characterized as stab wounds (deeper
    than long); and some she could not definitively characterize as either incised
    or stab wounds.</span></p>

    were required to distinguish between incised wounds and stab wounds when
    referring to the knife wounds in cross-examination, closing argument, or the
    instructions to the jury. The appellant submits the distinction drawn by Dr.
    Rose was important to the defence in that Dr. Rose’s description of the manner
    in which incised wounds were inflicted was consistent with the appellant’s
    description of swinging the knife blindly in an effort to defend himself.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The distinction between incised wounds and stab
    wounds, as articulated by Dr. Rose, offered some support for the defence
    position concerning the manner in which the injuries occurred. I observe,
    however, that support seems limited. The many internal injuries inflicted on
    Mr. Fleetwood by the appellant clearly indicate he was doing more than blindly waving
    the knife about. It is also significant experienced trial counsel did not rely
    on the distinction between incised wounds and stab wounds in his closing argument.
    Instead, counsel relied on the “20 or 30” blows struck by the appellant with
    the knife as indicative of the appellant’s desperation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Whatever the value to the defence case of the
    distinction between incised wounds and stab wounds might have been, I do not
    accept Crown counsel or the trial judge were required to use exclusively Dr.
    Rose’s nomenclature when referring to the knife wounds. Dr. Rose used the
    terminology commonly employed by pathologists to help her describe the contours
    of individual knife wounds. To the extent counsel or the trial judge were
    referencing Dr. Rose’s evidence, it is incumbent on them to do so accurately. However,
    in referring to the wounds themselves, ordinary parlance allows for the
    description of all wounds inflicted with the knife as stab wounds. I see
    nothing misleading in referring to 30 stab wounds when describing the number of
    wounds, or the location of the wounds on Mr. Fleetwood’s body. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For example, in cross-examination, Crown counsel
    sought to stress the number and location on Mr. Fleetwood’s body of the many
    knife wounds inflicted by the appellant. The Crown did so to rebut the
    appellant’s evidence he swung wildly and defensively with his eyes closed, not
    meaning to cause Mr. Fleetwood serious harm. For the purposes of the Crown’s
    questions, it did not matter whether any particular wound was characterized by
    Dr. Rose as an incised wound or a stab wound. What mattered to the Crown’s
    questions was the number of wounds and the location of the wounds on Mr.
    Fleetwood’s body. In that context, there is nothing misleading in the use of
    the more generic phrase “stab wounds”. The same observation applies to the
    trial judge’s reference to “30 stab wounds” in the course of his summarizing
    parts of the evidence relevant to the various issues. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no objection by counsel for the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the appellant also argues some of
    the appellant’s answers to Crown counsel’s questions about “30 stab wounds” indicate
    those questions were misleading. I disagree. On occasion when answering
    questions in which the Crown had made reference to “30 stab wounds”, the
    appellant referred to Dr. Rose’s distinction between incised wounds and stab
    wounds. To the extent the appellant regarded that distinction as relevant to
    his answer, he was entitled to make the distinction as part of his answer.
    However, the Crown was not obliged to incorporate the distinction, which the
    Crown viewed as irrelevant for its purposes, into the question.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Not even Dr. Rose maintained the distinction
    between incised wounds and stab wounds throughout her evidence. She used the
    phrase “stab wounds” when referring to all of the wounds to the torso, although
    she testified she could not characterize some of those wounds as incised or stab
    wounds due to the decomposition of the body. The stab wounds to Mr. Fleetwood’s
    torso caused his death. </span></p>

    nor the trial judge are, however, required to use terminology that best accords

    and the Crown used the phrase “30 stab wounds”, and bearing in mind the limited
    purpose underlying the distinction drawn by Dr. Rose between incised wounds and
    stab wounds, the use of the phrase “30 stab wounds” did not misstate her

    instruct the jury, even if the appellant’s evidence does not leave the jury
    with a doubt, the jury can convict only if, based on the evidence it does
    accept, the Crown has proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the
    trial judge repeatedly instructed the jury the Crown had the burden on each

    potentially fatal. The appellant’s post-offence conduct strongly suggested he
    did not act in self-defence. If the jury rejected the appellant’s version of

    judge’s misstatement in his initial instructions could potentially have caused
    some confusion, his concise and correct answer to the specific question posed by
    the jury removed any possibility of confusion as to the requisite <em>mens rea</em><em><span

    jury’s question on provocation?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge correctly left provocation with
    the jury, even though the appellant resisted any suggestion he lost control of
    himself during the fatal encounter with Mr. Fleetwood. The appellant does not take
    issue with the initial instructions on provocation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury asked three questions relating to the
    instructions on provocation. The appellant’s argument on appeal focuses on the
    third question. In that question, the jury asked for “the legal definition of
    loss of self-control”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge, after hearing submissions from
    counsel, interpreted the jury’s question as directed at the second of the four
    elements of the defence of provocation, outlined by the trial judge in his
    initial instructions. In describing that element, the trial judge had told the
    jury to determine whether the wrongful act or insult was sufficient “to deprive
    an ordinary person of the power of self-control”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge told the jury the words should
    be given their “ordinary meaning”. He went on to remind the jury of the
    ordinary person standard to be applied in addressing loss of self-control. In
    answering the question as he did, the trial judge followed the submissions of
    counsel for the appellant. The Crown had requested a wider response which
    included reference to the appellant’s state of mind. The Crown took the
    position the appellant had all but denied losing self-control in his testimony.
    On this view of the evidence, any reference to the subjective component of
    provocation could not help the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the appellant argues the trial judge
    erred in focusing exclusively on the ordinary person standard when answering the
    question. He submits the jury should have been instructed on the other elements
    of the defence that engage the appellant’s subjective state of mind. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I interpret the question as the trial judge did.
    The trial judge properly focused his answer on the specific question asked. That
    question did not invite further instructions on other elements of the
    provocation defence. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span lang=EN-CA>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial judge misstate the appellant’s
    evidence?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits the trial judge repeatedly
    told the jury the appellant went to the bathroom after the struggle with Mr.
    Fleetwood ended “to clean up”. The appellant testified he made his way from the
    bedroom to the bathroom and closed the bathroom door in an effort to get away
    from Mr. Fleetwood. The appellant submits the trial judge’s misstatement of his
    purpose in going to the bathroom significantly undermined his self-defence
    claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I have outlined the appellant’s evidence on this
    point earlier in my reasons (see para. 17). It was common ground the appellant,
    after stabbing Mr. Fleetwood many times, made his way to the bathroom and,
    while in the bathroom, attempted to clean the blood in the bathroom and from
    his hands (at least) before he returned to the bedroom, where Mr. Fleetwood lay
    dead or dying. The appellant then set about trying to clean up his blood in the
    bedroom. The appellant maintained, however, that his purpose in going into the
    bathroom was not to clean up, but to get away from Mr. Fleetwood, who he
    believed was still alive. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge referred to the evidence
    relating to the appellant’s movement to the bathroom and his actions in the
    bathroom on four occasions during his instructions. On one of these occasions,
    when reviewing the position of the defence, the trial judge accurately set out
    the appellant’s evidence he went to the bathroom to try to get away from Mr.
    Fleetwood.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the other three occasions, the trial judge
    made briefer references to the evidence and related it to certain issues
    pertaining to self-defence or the required <em>mens rea</em>. At least one of
    those references, and perhaps two, could be understood as the trial judge
    indicating the evidence was the appellant had gone to the bathroom to clean up.
    While that was the inference urged by the Crown, it was contrary to the
    appellant’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept at least one, and perhaps two, of the
    trial judge’s references to the evidence can reasonably be characterized as a potentially
    misleading description of the appellant’s evidence. I do not, however, agree
    these statements vitiated the verdict. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge reminded the jury that it was
    their responsibility to determine the facts and their recollection of the
    evidence that mattered. I see no reason to think the jury did not follow that
    instruction. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also do not share the appellant’s view as to
    the significance of the trial judge’s misstatement of the evidence. The
    after-the-fact conduct, considered as a whole, provided powerful evidence
    pointing away from self-defence. Assuming the appellant initially went to the
    bathroom to get away from Mr. Fleetwood, there remained a formidable body of
    after-the-fact conduct supporting the Crown’s position. On the appellant’s own
    evidence, he remained in the bathroom, attempting to clean up the blood without
    making any effort to assist Mr. Fleetwood, even though he knew he had stabbed
    Mr. Fleetwood and Mr. Fleetwood was making “gurgling” sounds in the bedroom. Even
    after the appellant returned to the bedroom, he focused on attempts to destroy potential
    evidence, rather than making any effort to assist Mr. Fleetwood.  </span></p>

    aggressor. Nor, however, does the verdict preclude the trial judge from finding
    the appellant was the aggressor. That factual finding is not inconsistent with
    any factual finding implicit in the jury’s verdict: see <em>R. v. Ferguson</em>,
