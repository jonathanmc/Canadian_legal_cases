lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Beth Markowski, owns a cottage
    near Lake Waseosa. Her property is not directly on the waterfront but she has a
    right-of-way over a beach that leads to Lake Waseosa for “all the usual
    purposes”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents, Dwayne and Kathleen Verhey, own
    two adjoining lots, including the beach over which the appellant has a right-of-way.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The key issue on this appeal is whether the
    “usual purposes” entitles the appellant to bring boats across the right-of-way
    using a motor vehicle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims it does.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents accept that the right-of-way
    allows the appellant to access Lake Waseosa “for various activities such as
    swimming and boating” but deny that she is allowed to bring boats to and from
    the shore using a motor vehicle. They take the position that the right to bring
    boats across is limited to small boats that can be portaged across the right-of-way.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the originating proceedings, the appellant
    brought an application seeking a declaration about the extent of her rights pursuant
    to the right-of-way. The appellant claims she has a right to cross the beach as
    well as to use the beach for recreational purposes. She claims this includes
    the right to launch and retrieve watercraft using mechanical power as may be
    necessary. She challenges the portion of the application judge’s decision
    holding otherwise.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2016, the appellant bought a cottage lot
    described as Pt Lt 10 Con 12 Chaffey Part 2, RD999. Her lot is not on the waterfront.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1997, the respondents, Dwayne and Kathleen
    Verhey, bought two lots described as Pt Lt 10 Con 12 Chaffey, Parts 3 and 6,
    RD999. One of those lots, Part 6, is on the waterfront.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>None of the parties to the appeal are parties to
    the original instruments that created the lots or the right-of-way in dispute.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before 1969, Parts 2 through 6 formed part of a
    larger parcel of land that was acquired by Frederick Rhoads and used by members
    of the Rhoads family. The family built four cottages on the parcel and used the
    beach as a common recreational area.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1969, the parcel was formally subdivided into
    four cottage lots, an access road, and a beach lot over which the cottage lots
    had a right-of-way. Parts 2 and 3 are two of the cottage lots. Part 6 is the
    beach lot. The lots were conveyed to the Rhoads children in 1970; all but Dale
    Rhoads have since sold their lots.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>All of the cottage lots, apart from Part 3, have
    a right-of-way over Part 6. The right-of-way was created in 1970 when the lots
    were conveyed to the Rhoads children. The deed to the appellant’s property contains
    a right-of-way “for all the usual purposes, in, over, along and upon” the waterfront
    property at Part 6.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s lot (Part 2) and the
    respondents’ lots (Parts 3 and 6) are shown on the reference plan attached to
    these reasons as Appendix A.</span></p>

style='line-height:200%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>THE APPLICATION JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge reviewed the meaning of
    the words “the usual purposes” in the right-of-way and the history of how the Rhoads
    family used what is now Part 6.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He noted that the historical uses of a right-of-way
    are informative, though not determinative, of the meaning to be attributed to the
    phrase “the usual purposes”. The application judge held that the phrase “for
    all the usual purposes” should be interpreted to “refer to the purposes of the
    right of way not … the purposes to which Part 6 was being put at the time of
    the grant.” Otherwise, the grant would confer “an ownership interest in Part 6”
    when what was conveyed was a right-of-way. He concluded that the uses “must be
    those appurtenant to the easement, not the land itself. That is to say, the
    right to gain access to Lake Waseosa over Part 6.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge then attempted to
    distinguish between the historic uses that would have required permission from the
    owner of the beach and those that were part of the right-of-way and therefore would
    not.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He found that launching and retrieving large
    boats was an activity that would have only been done with the express or
    implied permission of the owner of the beach and as family members, not as part
    of the right-of-way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I … find that the daily use the owners of
    Parts 2, 4, and 5 made of their right to cross the beach included swimming, and
    its related activities such as building sand castles, and sunbathing and
    perhaps the use of canoes or kayaks. This was done without the express
    permission of Frederick when he was alive or Paul [Rhoads, who received title
    to Parts 3 and 6 after Frederick’s death]. However other activities such as …
    launching and retrieving large boats … would have been extended family
    activities or extraordinary ones that would have been done with the permission
    of the owner of the beach lot. It was in this context that the grants of
    easement over Part 6 were made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He therefore held that the right-of-way included
    the following uses as part of “the usual purposes”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. Regular access to Lake Waseosa for the
    purpose of swimming or related aquatic activities,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>B. Use of that part of the beach directly
    adjacent to the swimming area during such activities,</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(i) for children’s recreational activity.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(ii) temporary storage of towels, clothing,
    beach chairs etc. while the users of such items are present on the beach, and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>C. Launch and retrieval of small craft capable
    of being carried or dragged across the beach without resort to mechanical
    power, but not the storage of such craft.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s notice of appeal claims the
    application judge made palpable and overriding errors in Part C of his order by
    restricting the appellant’s right to bring boats across the right-of-way on
    Part 6 in the following ways:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>He limited ingress and egress to “launch and retrieval of small

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>He limited ingress and egress to “what amounts to pedestrian travel
    … with no evidence to suggest a limitation to pedestrian travel or to
    pedestrian travel with small crafts that can be dragged or carried”; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>He limited ingress and egress to pedestrian travel notwithstanding
    uncontradicted evidence that the right-of-way included the launching of boats
    as of right.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims the order unduly limits her
    use of the right-of-way to pedestrian traffic thereby rendering the basic right
    of ingress and egress “almost useless”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her factum, the appellant claims the
    application judge also erred in Parts A and B of his order by “limiting the
    right to use of land based on inadequate language, such as ‘children’s recreation’
    rather than general recreation”. This issue was not raised in the notice of appeal.
    The only relief sought in the notice of appeal is that the restriction in Part

    accept that the application judge erred by “caus[ing] the right of way to be
    limited to pedestrian traffic only” without any argument to that effect being
    raised by the parties. The application judge was not asked to, nor did he, rule
    broadly on the means by which the appellant may travel across the right-of-way.
    He properly restricted himself to the issue raised in the notice of application
    – whether the right-of-way included the “use of Part 6 as a beach for
    recreational purposes”. He accepted that one of these recreational purposes was
    launching boats but restricted the right to launch large boats that needed to
    be towed using a motor vehicle.</span></p>
