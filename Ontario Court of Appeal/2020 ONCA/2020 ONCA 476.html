    Minnema of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 13, 2019, with reasons reported
    at 2019 ONSC 3707, 25 R.F.L. (8th) 195.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><span lang=EN-CA>Feldman J.A.:</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue on this appeal is whether a plea asking
    the court to set aside a marriage contract is subject to a limitation period,
    and if so, what is the period?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties entered into a prenuptial agreement
    (the “marriage contract”) immediately before their marriage. The contract waived
    any entitlement to spousal support and provided that the parties would be
    separate as to property. After seven years of marriage, the parties separated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Eventually, the husband brought family law proceedings
    claiming equalization of net family property and spousal support. The wife
    defended by relying on the marriage contract as a complete answer. He replied
    by asking the court to set aside or rescind the marriage contract on the basis that
    he had signed it without financial disclosure, without legal advice, under
    duress, and under a clear power imbalance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the husband commenced the proceeding
    within the six-year limitation period for equalization claims under the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, s. 7(3)(b), more than two years had elapsed since
    the parties separated. The wife’s position was that the request to rescind the marriage
    contract was out of time. On summary judgment, the motion judge found that rescission
    of a marriage contract constitutes a “claim” under the <em>Limitations Act</em><i>,
    2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sched. B., that claim is subject to the two-year limitation
    period in s. 4 of the Act, and the husband discovered his claim roughly two
    months after separation. The motion judge therefore found the claim to be
    time-barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal. The husband’s plea for rescission of the marriage contract is a
    proceeding for a declaration where no consequential relief is sought and
    therefore, under s. 16(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, no limitation
    period applies to that pleading. The husband’s claim for equalization is
    subject to the six-year period set out in s. 7(3)(b) of the <em>Family Law Act</em>,
    and his claim for spousal support is not subject to a limitation period,
    pursuant to s. 16(1)(c) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>. Neither is time-barred
    and the action may proceed.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties married in July 2005 after
    cohabiting for one year.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One week before the wedding, they signed the
    marriage contract based on a template for prenuptial agreements that the wife
    had found on the internet. Although the contract states that each party “has
    retained their own lawyer and has received independent legal advice”, neither the
    husband nor the wife retained or consulted a lawyer. Similarly, the contract
    states that the parties exchanged financial disclosure, but no formal exchange took
    place.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The agreement contains provisions setting out
    the parties’ intent to keep their assets separate, to bar any property claims
    following separation, and to waive any future rights to spousal support. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the parties separated in August 2012, the
    husband moved out of the matrimonial home, which was owned by the wife. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties retained counsel and began
    negotiations until the husband abandoned the negotiations in the spring of 2013
    because his existing mental illness had worsened. In the spring of 2015, the
    husband’s lawyer contacted the wife’s lawyer to indicate that the husband was
    preparing to initiate a court proceeding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, no proceeding was commenced until
    August 24, 2017, when the husband brought an application for spousal support,
    equalization of net family property, and yearly financial disclosure. The
    husband did not explicitly seek to set aside the marriage contract in his original
    pleading, but his statement of facts referred to the contract and stated that
    he had signed it with no legal advice, no financial disclosure, and under
    duress.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The wife filed an answer, relying primarily on
    the marriage contract as a defence to the husband’s claims. She subsequently
    amended her answer to argue that the husband’s claim to set aside the marriage
    contract was statute-barred by s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the amendment, the husband filed a reply
    contesting the applicability of the <em>Limitations Act</em> and stating that
    the marriage contract should be deemed invalid because he signed it “without
    financial disclosure, without legal advice, under duress and with a clear power
    imbalance.”</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Decision of the Motion Judge</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue whether the husband’s request to set
    aside the marriage contract was statute-barred was heard four weeks prior to
    the scheduled trial date, as a summary judgment motion. The two issues on the
    motion were whether a trial was required to decide: first, whether the two-year
    limitation period in s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> applies to an
    application to set aside a marriage contract under s. 56(4) of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>; and second, if so, whether the husband had brought his
    application in time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dealing with the first issue, the motion judge
    found that the request to set aside the marriage contract constituted a “claim to
    remedy an injury, loss or damage” within the meaning of s. 4 of the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>. The husband’s loss was the extinguishment of his rights under the <em>Family
    Law Act</em> to equalization and spousal support by an allegedly improperly obtained
    marriage contract: at para. 27. Therefore, the two-year limitation period applied
    unless the <em>Limitations Act</em> provided otherwise. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge then considered whether a
    request to set aside a marriage contract comes within s. 16(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations
    Act</em>. That section provides that there is no limitation period for “a
    proceeding for a declaration if no consequential relief is sought”. The motion
    judge found that while the husband was seeking a declaration that the marriage
    contract was of no force or effect, s. 16(1)(a) was not engaged because he was
    also seeking the consequential relief of spousal support and equalization of
    net family property: at para. 31.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Having found that the two-year limitation period
    applied, the motion judge turned to the question of when the husband discovered
    his claim, using the criteria in s. 5 of the <em>Limitations Act</em>. He found
    that by October 17, 2012, when the husband told his social worker that the
    marriage contract “had issues” and that the wife was still relying on it, the husband
    knew that a court proceeding was appropriate: at para. 44. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge rejected the husband’s further
    argument that he was not legally able to discover what limitation period
    applied to a proceeding to rescind a marriage contract under s. 56(4) of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em> because there was no previous case law on the issue: at para. 46. The
    motion judge also considered whether the husband’s mental health issues had
    made him incapable of commencing the proceeding until he did so more than two
    years after October 17, 2012, but the motion judge found no evidence in the
    record to make incapacity a genuine issue for trial: at para. 50.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the motion judge found that he
    could decide on the record before him on summary judgment that the husband’s request
    for rescission of the marriage contract was out of time, as more than two years
    had elapsed since he discovered his claim: at para. 51.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>D.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Issues on Appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sole issue on the appeal is whether the
    motion judge erred by dismissing the husband’s claims for equalization and
    spousal support on summary judgment because his plea to rescind the marriage
    contract was statute-barred. As the <em>Family Law Act</em> provides no
    limitation period for an application to set aside a marriage contract, the
    appeal requires this court to decide which of the <em>Limitations Act</em>’s
    provisions governs the request to set aside the marriage contract under s.
    56(4) of the<i> <em>Family Law Act</em></i>. The question is thus whether the
    application to set aside the marriage contract is subject to no limitation
    period because it is a proceeding under s. 16(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act</em> for a declaration where no consequential relief is sought, or whether it is subject
    to the two-year limitation period and if so, when the loss or damage occurred and
    when the claim was discovered.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties agree that the standard of review on
    this appeal is correctness. Although the motion judge made a number of
    determinations of mixed fact and law in granting summary judgment, the issue
    under appeal is whether he erred in law by determining that the two-year
    limitation period under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act</em> applies to an
    application under s. 56(4) of the <em>Family Law Act</em>. </span></p>

    between a declaratory and a remedial judgment as follows in his text, <em>The
    Law of Declaratory Judgments</em>, 4th ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2016), at
    p. 54:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A distinction is made between a remedial
    judgment and a declaration. In those provinces where declaratory orders are
    excluded from limitations statutes or the purview of juries, the distinction is
    crucial. A remedial judgment carries within its own terms a solution for the
    cure of a dispute, be that an order to do or not to do, or more specifically,
    to pay, deliver over, seize, sell, dissolve, remove, or refrain. It is
    self-executing in the sense that the parties and the executing officer need no
    further direction or authorization than that contained in the judgment. A
    declaration confirms or denies the existence of a right, as if bearing witness
    to what has always been the legal relationship between the disputing parties.
    Put that way, it is an existential judgment that considers rights to be or not
    to be. An executing officer would be at a loss for guidance if called upon to
    execute the declaration because no remedial course is stated in the declaration.
    The parties are not even called upon to take the next step in accommodating the
    declaration: rather, their challenge is to consider immediate compliance, or
    new court proceedings to remedy a situation interpreted and clarified by the
    declaration. [Footnote omitted.] </span></p>

    Act</em> provides that there will be no limitation period for a proceeding for
    a declaration “if no consequential relief is sought”. As this is a limitations
    statute, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the question is: what is the
    meaning of consequential relief in this section, and what is the intent of
    limiting the circumstances when there will be no limitation period to when the
    request for a declaration does not also claim consequential relief?  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To answer the question, one must be careful not
    to confuse procedure with substance in interpreting and applying s. 16(1)(a) of
    the <em>Limitations Act</em>. The <em>Limitations Act</em> is not concerned
    with procedural issues: the purpose and effect of its provisions is to govern
    the time limits for commencing actions and proceedings. Whether the parties
    have combined different claims or causes of action into one or more proceedings
    will not alter the time periods that govern. Put differently, different
    limitation periods may govern different claims in the same action.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The key, therefore, is not whether consequential
    relief in the form of a claim for a remedy against another party is sought
    procedurally in the same proceeding or in a subsequent proceeding. The key is
    whether the request for a declaration coupled with a claim for enforceable
    relief is, in substance, a claim for a remedy against the other party and not
    merely a request for a declaratory order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is because, if it is a claim for a
    substantive remedy against another party, then the limitation period applicable
    to that substantive remedy will apply to that claim. Similarly, if a
    declaration is necessary as a prelude to a claim for a remedy against another
    person, no limitation period applies to the proceeding for a declaration, but the
    applicable limitation period for seeking the remedial order may still bar that
    claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, if a party seeks both consequential
    and declaratory relief against another party, the consequential relief is
    subject to the limitation periods set forth in the <em>Limitations Act</em>, or
    in this case, the <em>Family Law Act</em>, while the declaratory relief alone
    benefits from the absence of a limitation period. The bar is not against
    joining a claim for consequential relief; the bar is against applying no
    limitation period to the consequential relief.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Applying the principle to this case, where the
    husband seeks a declaration that would remove a significant obstacle to his
    claims for equalization and for spousal support, that declaration is subject to
    no limitation period, pursuant to s. 16(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.
    The limitations governing the consequential relief he seeks, namely
    equalization and support, are the periods applicable to those forms of relief:
    six years from the date of separation for equalization, and no limitation
    period for support. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Conversely, had the husband brought his
    equalization claim seven years after the date of separation with no reasonable
    possibility of reconciliation, and therefore out of time, the fact that he
    would be able to obtain a declaration setting aside the marriage contract would
    not mean that his equalization claim could proceed. That claim would remain
    time-barred, subject to the power of the court to extend the time under s.
    2(8). </span></p>

    any relief that is sought that depends on the outcome of the declaration
    proceeding as consequential relief, the intent and effect of s. 16(1)(a) is not
    to preclude the party seeking the declaration from also asking for
    consequential relief as a matter of procedure. It is to prevent a party who
    seeks a consequential remedy from circumventing the limitation period that is
    applicable to the claim for the remedy by joining that claim with an
    application for a declaration: see, for example, <em>Alguire v. The

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Conclusion on s. 16(1)(a) of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i></span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I conclude that a proceeding under s. 56(4) of
    the <em>Family Law Act</em> comes within s. 16(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act</em>.
    There is no limitation period for bringing the proceeding for a declaration
    setting aside a marriage contract, whether as a stand-alone matter or if the
    proceeding also claims other family law relief. The other relief remains
    subject to the applicable limitation periods, including the residual discretion
    of a family court to grant extensions of time under s. 2(8) of the <em>Family
    Law Act</em>. In this case, those limitation periods are six years for the
    husband’s equalization claim, and there is no limitation period for his spousal
    support claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This result also works seamlessly within the
    limitation structure of the <em>Family Law Act</em>, because it does not add a
    new, shorter limitation period of two years, which would disrupt the longer
    time spouses have been given to resolve their affairs. It does not interfere
    with the philosophy of the Act, which is to give more generous time periods for
    separating spouses to resolve their claims for equalization and spousal
    support. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, while spouses may seek to set aside a
    marriage contract in the circumstances set out in s. 56(4) at any time, a
    spouse is unlikely to bring such an application during the marriage, even if
    the spouse learns that the other spouse failed to disclose some material assets
    when they were negotiating their agreement. If they remain happily married,
    there will be no need. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An application to set aside a marriage contract
    would likely be brought in the context of marriage break-up and its financial
    consequences for the parties. Those financial consequences are governed by the
    limitation periods specified in the Act and in the <em>Limitations Act</em>. An
    application to set aside a marriage contract will not extend or reduce those
    periods. </span></p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Is the request to set aside a marriage contract
    a claim for loss or damage caused by an act or omission?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Because of my conclusion that the request to set
    aside a marriage contract under s. 56(4) of the <em>Family Law Act</em> is a
    proceeding for a declaration where no consequential relief is sought under 16(1)(a)
    of the <em>Limitations Act</em>, it is unnecessary to consider whether that
    request falls within the definition of claim, and in that context when the loss
    or damage occurred and when the husband discovered the claim. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I conclude that the motion judge
    erred in law in failing to find that s. 16(1)(a) of the <em>Limitations Act</em><i> </i>applies to a proceeding under s. 56(4) of the <em>Family Law Act</em> for a
    declaration setting aside the marriage contract, and in finding that the two-year
    limitation period under s. 4 applies.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore allow the appeal and set aside
    the summary judgment, with costs of the appeal to the husband in the agreed
    amount of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and HST. If the parties are unable
    to agree on the costs of the summary judgment motion in light of the
    disposition of the appeal, they may each file costs submissions not exceeding
    two pages in length by August 10, 2020.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> Professor Sarna explains, at pp. 55-56, that some actions for
    declaratory relief may nevertheless seek remedial orders:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:10.0pt'>The importance of
    defining an order as declaratory or remedial lies in part in the question of
    limitations. Limitation periods for remedial claims are statutorily different
    than that for declarations, if any. For example, many provincial statutes
    define the “remedial order” as a judgment or an order made by a court in a
    civil proceeding requiring a defendant to comply with a duty or to pay damages
    for the violation of a right, but excludes a declaration of rights and duties,
    legal relations, or personal status without consequential relief.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:10.0pt'>If in addition to
    declaratory relief, a claim against pension trustees would require them to act
    by making payment, the thrust of the action seeks a remedial order, and engages
    the [Ontario] <i>Limitations Act</i>. Similarly, a foreclosure action
    effectively seeks a remedial order because an order nisi, although containing a
    declaration of a mortgage being in default, also orders requiring the debtor to
    pay. The borderline cases where a litigant tries to avoid the limitations bar
    by using a declaratory recourse will easily be screened out by the presumption
    that all claims are caught by limitations. Accordingly, the litigant cannot
    avoid the consequences of the passage of time by seeking a declaration that
    money is payable. [Footnotes omitted.]</span></p>
