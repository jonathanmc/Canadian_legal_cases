  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Sentencing judges are among those decision&#8209;makers
    who have the power to influence the treatment of aboriginal offenders in the
    justice system. They determine most directly whether an aboriginal offender
    will go to jail, or whether other sentencing options may be employed which will
    play perhaps a stronger role in restoring a sense of balance to the offender,
    victim, and community, and in preventing future crime. </span></p>

    the availability of a conditional sentence for offences, prosecuted by
    indictment, where the maximum penalty is 14 years or life in prison, under s.
    15 of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, because its effect is to
    discriminate against Aboriginal offenders on the basis of race. The sentencing

    contravene two sections of the <em>Charter</em>: they contravene s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em> because their effect is to discriminate against Aboriginal offenders on the
    basis of race, and they contravene s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> because they
    are arbitrary and overbroad in relation to their purpose. While the s. 7
    challenge was initially raised before the sentencing judge, it was withdrawn at
    the submission stage after all the evidence was heard and he did not rule on it.
    This court allowed Ms. Sharma to raise the s. 7 challenge on the appeal.</span></p>

    provisions contravene both ss. 7 and 15 of the <em>Charter</em> and are not saved
    by s. 1. I would allow the appeal and strike down the provisions. I would set
    aside Ms. Sharma’s custodial sentence. As submitted by Ms. Sharma, the
    appropriate sentence would have been 24 months less a day, to be served
    conditionally. However, as Ms. Sharma has served her custodial sentence, I
    would substitute a sentence of time served.</span></p>

    exchange for $20,000 from her boyfriend to avoid homelessness for herself and
    for her daughter. After she was apprehended, she confessed to the RCMP that she

    money but I would have to do something for him. He said I would have to take a
    vacation and do a few things for him down there. I said okay because I didn’t
    have any way to get the money to pay off my bills and it needed to be paid or
    else me and my daughter would have gone homeless and I couldn’t let that happen
    because I didn’t bring life into this would to be raised like that – without a
    home. I wanted to raise my daughter better than I was raised. I wanted to be
    independent and take care of her and when I got behind in rent I didn’t know

    kilogram of a Schedule I substance attracted a mandatory minimum sentence of
    two years’ imprisonment, pursuant to s. 6(3)(a.1) of the <em>CDSA</em>, subject
    to the following proviso, in s. 8:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><span lang=EN-CA>8</span></b><span lang=EN-CA> The
    court is not required to impose a minimum punishment unless it is satisfied

    contained within ss. 718, 718.1, and 718.2 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, s.
    718.2(e) was notably relevant to the sentencing of an Aboriginal offender like
    Ms. Sharma. That provision codifies the principle that “all available
    sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and
    consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be
    considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of
    Aboriginal offenders.” The Supreme Court has held that s. 718.2(e) specifically
    instructs courts to consider whether to impose a conditional sentence, namely a
    sentence served in the community under strict conditions, pursuant to s. 742.1
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: <em>Gladue</em>, at para. 40. </span></p>

    that followed Ms. Sharma’s arrest, the Crown sought a sentence in the six-year
    range. That position changed to three years and six months in the Crown factum
    filed on sentencing in September 2017, on the basis of balancing the
    seriousness of the offence with the <i>Gladue </i>factors codified in s.
    718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. One week later, the Crown withdrew the
    notice pursuant to s. 8 of the <em>CDSA</em> and instead sought a sentence of
    18 months in light of the personal hardship Ms. Sharma had endured. </span></p>

    represented a unique mode of sentencing. Conditional sentences allow a sentencing
    judge to impose a sentence to fit the circumstances of the offender and further
    the goals of denunciation and deterrence, but permit the offender to serve that
    sentence in the community on conditions including a form of house arrest. The
    statutory scheme sets out certain mandatory conditions in s. 742.3(1) and
    confers discretion on the sentencing judge to impose further conditions in s.
    742.3(2). When first enacted, a conditional sentence could be imposed where
    three conditions were met: the offence did not carry a mandatory minimum
    sentence; the sentence imposed was less than two years; and serving the
    sentence in the community would not pose a danger to the community. </span></p>

    Minister of Justice explained to the House of Commons Standing Committee on
    Justice and Legal Affairs that alternatives to incarceration were necessary
    given the reality that Aboriginal offenders were overrepresented in prisons, as
    quoted at para. 47 of <em>Gladue</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he reason we referred specifically [in s.
    718.2(e)] to aboriginal persons is that they are sadly overrepresented in the
    prison populations of Canada. I think it was the Manitoba justice inquiry that
    found that although aboriginal persons make up only 12% of the population of
    Manitoba, they comprise over 50% of the prison inmates. Nationally aboriginal
    persons represent about 2% of Canada’s population, but they represent 10.6% of
    persons in prison. Obviously there’s a problem here. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>What we’re trying to do, particularly having
    regard to the initiatives in the aboriginal communities to achieve community
    justice, is to encourage courts to look at alternatives where it’s consistent
    with the protection of the public – alternatives to jail – and not simply
    resort to that easy answer in every case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In other words, Parliament recognized the
    significant problem of overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in prisons in
    Canada, and enacted both a directive to sentencing judges in s. 718.2(e) and,
    most importantly, a real tool to address the problem in s. 742.1: the
    conditional sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In its landmark 1999 decision in <em>Gladue</em>,
    the Supreme Court identified s. 718.2(e) as a “watershed”, not merely a
    restatement of existing principles of restraint in sentencing: at para. 39. The
    court stated, at para. 40, that the purpose of s. 718.2(e) was remedial,
    particularly given the concurrent introduction of the conditional sentence in
    s. 742.1:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The availability of the conditional sentence
    of imprisonment, in particular, alters the sentencing landscape in a manner
    which gives an entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should
    be resorted to only where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the
    circumstances. The creation of the conditional sentence suggests, on its face,
    a desire to lessen the use of incarceration. The general principle expressed in
    s. 718.2(e) must be construed and applied in this light.</span></p>

    it relates specifically to Aboriginal people, the court discussed at length the
    “serious problem of aboriginal overrepresentation in Canadian prisons”: <em>Gladue</em>,
    at para. 59. The court observed that this problem is well documented and only
    one manifestation of the broader issue of Aboriginal overrepresentation in the
    criminal justice system, noting, at para. 61:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Not surprisingly, the excessive imprisonment
    of aboriginal people is only the tip of the iceberg insofar as the estrangement
    of the aboriginal peoples from the Canadian criminal justice system is
    concerned. Aboriginal people are overrepresented in virtually all aspects of
    the system. As this Court recently noted in <em>R. v. Williams</em>, [1998] 1
    S.C.R. 1128, at para. 58, there is widespread bias against aboriginal people
    within Canada, and “[t]here is evidence that this widespread racism has
    translated into systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system”.</span></p>

    important role that sentencing judges could play in remedying injustice against
    Aboriginal people, at para. 65 of <em>Gladue</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is clear that sentencing innovation by
    itself cannot remove the causes of aboriginal offending and the greater problem
    of aboriginal alienation from the criminal justice system. The unbalanced ratio
    of imprisonment for aboriginal offenders flows from a number of sources,
    including poverty, substance abuse, lack of education, and the lack of
    employment opportunities for aboriginal people.&nbsp;It arises also from bias
    against aboriginal people and from an unfortunate institutional approach that
    is more inclined to refuse bail and to impose more and longer prison terms for
    aboriginal offenders.&nbsp;There are many aspects of this sad situation which
    cannot be addressed in these reasons.&nbsp;<u>What can and must be addressed,
    though, is the limited role that sentencing judges will play in remedying
    injustice against aboriginal peoples in Canada.&nbsp;Sentencing judges are
    among those decision&#8209;makers who have the power to influence the treatment
    of aboriginal offenders in the justice system.&nbsp;They determine most
    directly whether an aboriginal offender will go to jail, or whether other
    sentencing options may be employed which will play perhaps a stronger role in
    restoring a sense of balance to the offender, victim, and community, and in
    preventing future crime.</u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Importantly, the court in <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>rejected
    the suggestion that sentences that prioritize restorative justice principles are
    more lenient than sentences that impose a term of imprisonment. Rather, they
    reflect Aboriginal justice concepts and enable a sentencing judge to impose a
    sentence that will better serve the purposes of sentencing for an Aboriginal offender,
    as the court recognized at para. 74 of <em>Gladue</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[O]ne of the unique circumstances of
    aboriginal offenders is that community-based sanctions coincide with the
    aboriginal concept of sentencing and the needs of aboriginal people and
    communities. It is often the case that neither aboriginal offenders nor their
    communities are well served by incarcerating offenders, particularly for less
    serious or non-violent offences. Where these sanctions are reasonable in the
    circumstances, they should be implemented. In all instances, it is appropriate
    to attempt to craft the sentencing process and the sanctions imposed in
    accordance with the aboriginal perspective. </span></p>

    of the <em>Charter</em> and s. 718.2(e), the court stated, at para. 87 of <em>Gladue</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There is no constitutional challenge to s. 718.2(e)
    in these proceedings, and accordingly we do not address specifically the
    applicability of s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>. We would note, though, that the aim
    of s. 718.2(e) is to reduce the tragic overrepresentation of aboriginal people
    in prisons. It seeks to ameliorate the present situation and to deal with the
    particular offence and offender and community. The fact that a court is called
    upon to take into consideration the unique circumstances surrounding these
    different parties is not unfair to non&#8209;aboriginal people. Rather, the
    fundamental purpose of s. 718.2(e) is to treat aboriginal offenders fairly by
    taking into account their difference.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the court also explained that the
    remedial nature of s. 718.2(e) does not require an automatic reduction in
    sentence for all Aboriginal offenders. Rather, the court held at para. 88,
    sentencing continues to reflect the full circumstances of the offender and the
    offence, including the factor set out in s. 718.2(e):</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Section 718.2(e)] is one of the statutorily
    mandated considerations that a sentencing judge must take into account. It may
    not always mean a lower sentence for an aboriginal offender. The sentence
    imposed will depend upon <u>all</u> the factors which must be taken into
    account in each individual case. The weight to be given to these various
    factors will vary in each case. At the same time, it must in every case be
    recalled that the direction to consider these unique circumstances flows from
    the staggering injustice currently experienced by aboriginal peoples with the
    criminal justice system. The provision reflects the reality that many
    aboriginal people are alienated from this system which frequently does not
    reflect their needs or their understanding of an appropriate sentence. [Emphasis

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By 2012, courts in Canada had had 13 years to
    implement the Supreme Court’s directions in <em>Gladue</em>. However, in <em>R.
    v. Ipeelee</em>, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, the majority of the Supreme
    Court reported that “overrepresentation and alienation of Aboriginal peoples in
    the criminal justice system ha[d] only worsened” since <em>Gladue</em> and the
    1996 <em>Criminal Code</em> amendments: at para. 62. The majority accepted that
    the failure to alleviate the situation could be the result of ongoing
    misunderstanding and misapplication of s. 718.2(e) and the <em>Gladue</em> decision. Writing for the majority, LeBel J. sought to provide additional
    guidance. He recognized, at para. 65, that overincarceration of Aboriginal
    people could be caused or contributed to by two circumstances: either Aboriginal
    people commit a disproportionate number of crimes, or they are the victims of a
    discriminatory justice system. </span></p>

    can address both phenomena. Specifically, sentencing judges can address the first
    circumstance by imposing just sentences that meet the needs of Aboriginal offenders
    and their communities, thereby deterring criminality and rehabilitating
    offenders: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 66.</span></p>

    the focus of s. 718.2(e). The role of sentencing judges, “as front-line workers
    in the criminal justice system”, is to ensure that systemic factors do not
    inadvertently produce discriminatory sentencing results: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at
    para. 67. Factors such as employment status, family support, and education
    influence whether a person goes to jail in a borderline case. The court
    accepted that because social, political, and economic forces cause many Aboriginal
    people to experience instability in these areas, they are sentenced to jail
    more often, reflecting systemic discrimination: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 67. </span></p>

    impose just sanctions that do not operate in a discriminatory manner. At para.
    72, LeBel J. instructed sentencing judges to consider: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(1) the unique systemic and background factors
    which may have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender
    before the courts; and (2) the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions
    which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his
    or her particular Aboriginal heritage or connection. Both sets of circumstances
    bear on the ultimate question of what is a fit and proper sentence.</span></p>

    repeated the principles from <em>Gladue</em>, that Aboriginal communities traditionally
    have different conceptions of just punishment. By crafting a sentence to be
    served with appropriate conditions in the community that takes those views into
    account, the sentence imposed may be viewed as more just and may therefore be
    more effective in achieving the objectives of sentencing.</span></p>

    that treating Aboriginal offenders differently in sentencing violates the
    parity principle, codified in s. 718.2(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. That suggestion
    ignores the impact of the history of Aboriginal peoples in Canada, given that
    “[t]he overwhelming message emanating from the various reports and commissions

    a causal link between the systemic and background factors referred to in s.
    718.2(e) and the commission of the offence. Requiring a causal link is an error
    because it is well recognized that Aboriginal people have suffered from
    systemic discrimination in Canada, the effects of which are interconnected and
    complex. At para. 83 of <em>Ipeelee</em>, LeBel J. quoted with approval the
    Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba’s conclusion that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Cultural oppression,
    social inequality, the loss of self-government and systemic discrimination,
    which are the legacy of the Canadian government’s treatment of Aboriginal
    people, are intertwined and interdependent factors, and in very few cases is it
    possible to draw a simple and direct correlation between any one of them and
    the events which lead an individual Aboriginal person to commit a crime or to
    become incarcerated.</span></p>

    decisions since <em>Gladue</em> related to the applicability of <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>principles to serious or violent offences. Courts had picked up on one
    comment from <em>Gladue</em>, at paras. 33 and 79, that suggested that for such
    offences, Aboriginal offenders and other offenders would likely receive similar
    jail sentences. In <em>Ipeelee</em>, at paras. 86-87, LeBel J. clarified that
    the <em>Gladue</em> framework was obligatory in every case and that the
    sentencing court has a duty to apply s. 718.2(e), including for serious and
    violent offences:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Trying to carve out an exception from <em>Gladue</em> for serious offences would inevitably lead to inconsistency in the
    jurisprudence due to “the relative ease with which a sentencing judge could
    deem any number of offences to be ‘serious’” ([<span style='color:black'>R.
    Pelletier, “The Nullification of Section 718.2(e): Aggravating Aboriginal
    Over-representation in Canadian Prisons” (2001), 39 Osgoode Hall L.J. 469]</span>,
    at p. 479). It would also deprive s. 718.2(e) of much of its remedial power,
    given its focus on reducing overreliance on incarceration. A second question
    arises: Who are courts sentencing if not the offender standing in front of them?
    If the offender is Aboriginal, then courts must consider all of the
    circumstances of that offender, including the unique circumstances described in <i>Gladue</i>. There is no sense comparing the sentence that a particular
    Aboriginal offender would receive to the sentence that some hypothetical
    non-Aboriginal offender would receive, because there is only one offender
    standing before the court.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge has a statutory duty,
    imposed by s. 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, to consider the unique
    circumstances of Aboriginal offenders. Failure to apply <em>Gladue</em> in any
    case involving an Aboriginal offender runs afoul of this statutory obligation.
    As these reasons have explained, such a failure would also result in a sentence
    that was not fit and was not consistent with the fundamental principle of
    proportionality. Therefore, application of the <em>Gladue</em> principles is
    required in every case involving an Aboriginal offender, including breach of [a
    long-term supervision order], and a failure to do so constitutes an error
    justifying appellate intervention.</span></p>

    reinforcing, perpetuating or exacerbating their disadvantage”: <em>Taypotat</em>,

    “demonstrate that the law at issue has a disproportionate effect on the
    claimant based on his or her membership in an enumerated or analogous group”: <em>Taypotat</em>,
    at para. 21. However, at this second stage of the analysis, the specific evidence
    required “will vary depending on the context of the claim” and “‘evidence that

    the substantive inequality of Aboriginal people in sentencing. It is certainly
    the case that conditional sentences are available to all offenders, not just
    Aboriginal offenders. However, the legislative history and jurisprudence demonstrate
    that conditional sentences take on a unique significance in the context of
    Aboriginal offenders by conferring the added benefit of remedying systemic

    firearms offence would affect black offenders disproportionately because they
    are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. Code J. held, at para. 82,
    that the mandatory minimum sentence for the firearms offence did not draw a
    race-based distinction against black offenders because it did not cause any
    discriminatory effect; rather, that effect existed independently of the
    provision. In reaching this conclusion, Code J. endorsed the reasoning of Green
    J. in <em>R. v. Johnson</em>, 2011 ONCJ 77, 268 C.C.C. (3d) 423, at para. 130,
    which he quoted at para. 81 as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The Bill C-25 amendments, as I read them, do not
    create a distinction based on race. The impugned provisions apply to all
    offenders. While a disproportionate number of black and native persons may be
    captured by the amendments, they do not distinguish the Applicant from other
    offenders on the basis of his heritage, either in intent or effect. […] [T]he
    current demographic evidence relating to pretrial custody suggests that
    detention orders are correlated with considerations such as attenuated
    community ties, unemployment and a history of prior criminality. These factors
    may disproportionately characterize members of the black and Aboriginal
    community, but they are present in all racial and ethnic groups and <u>are far
    from universal or defining features of persons sharing either of the Applicant’s
    ancestries.</u><i> </i>Further, the Applicant’s argument, logically pursued,
    renders much of criminal law – or, at minimum, those statutory instruments
    bearing on penal sanctions – vulnerable to s. 15 challenge on the same footing.
    This hardly seems tenable. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    observation raised by Code J. in <em>Nur</em>, that the s. 15 argument amounted
    to the claim that because black offenders are disproportionately represented in
    the criminal justice system, then any penal provision will have a
    disproportionate effect on that community and will therefore be vulnerable to a
    s. 15 challenge. In this case, the Crown presented a similar “floodgates”
    argument, namely that Ms. Sharma’s claim amounted to saying that s. 742.1(c)
    created a distinction based on race because it was part of a discriminatory
    criminal justice system. In my view, the sentencing judge erred in accepting
    this argument and in characterizing Ms. Sharma’s claim in this way.</span></p>

    together with the conditional sentence, was to address the issue of
    overincarceration generally and in particular, the overincarceration of Aboriginal
    offenders in Canada. In <em>Gladue</em>, the court stated at paras. 50 and 51:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The parties and interveners agree that the
    purpose of s. 718.2(e) is to respond to the problem of overincarceration in

    connection between ss. 718.2(e) and 742.1, observing that “[t]he general
    principle expressed in s. 718.2(e) must be construed and applied” in light of
    the desire, reflected in the creation of the conditional sentence, to reduce
    the use of incarceration: at para. 40; see also <em>R. v. Proulx</em>, 2000 SCC
    5, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 92. The court acknowledged that
    overincarceration was part of the larger issue of overrepresentation of Aboriginal
    people within the criminal justice system, and the role that systemic
    discrimination played in causing and contributing to the circumstances that
    allowed that problem to develop. However, while the remedial sentencing
    provisions are aimed at addressing the larger issue indirectly through
    restorative justice in the context of sentencing, their direct focus is on
    reducing the number of Aboriginal offenders sentenced to jail. </span></p>

    the impugned provisions relates to the overincarceration of Aboriginal
    offenders, not their overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. By
    removing the ability to impose a conditional sentence instead of a prison sentence
    for an offence, the effect on an Aboriginal offender is to undermine the
    purpose and remedial effect of s. 718.2(e) in addressing the substantive
    inequality between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people manifested in overincarceration
    within the criminal justice system, which has been acknowledged by Parliament
    and the courts as requiring redress. I therefore reject the contention that any
    finding of a breach of s. 15 in this case will thereby open all penal
    provisions to a similar s. 15 attack. </span></p>

    the impugned provisions did not “create” the distinction of overincarceration
    of Aboriginal offenders, which already existed. This submission effectively
    relates to the second part of the analysis: the extent to which the law does or
    does not reinforce, exacerbate or perpetuate disadvantage for the affected
    group. Therefore, this submission properly belongs within the analysis under
    the second part. I nevertheless address it briefly here in response to the
    Crown’s submission.</span></p>

    technicalities: <em>Quebec v. Alliance</em>, at para. 26. It was intended to
    ensure that the claim was based on an enumerated or analogous ground. In
    referring to the creation of a distinction, the first part of the analysis merely
    asks whether the legislation created a differential impact on the basis of a
    protected ground. </span></p>

    in a discriminatory manner, that law will “create” a distinction. But where, as
    here, a law removes a remedial provision that was put in place to alleviate the
    discriminatory effect of other laws, then the removal of that remedial
    provision may not create a new distinction, but it will reinforce, perpetuate,
    or exacerbate the discriminatory effect that was intended to be alleviated by
    the remedial provision. As Abella J. explained in <em>Quebec v. Alliance</em>,
    at paras. 33-36, 42, provisions enacted to alleviate a discriminatory impact are
    not unchangeable, and can be modified, but any modifications must be constitutionally
    compliant in their effect, and must not cause a discriminatory impact.</span></p>

    scheme, with reference to the amended pay equity regime at issue in that case:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black;background:white'>I do not
    share the unions’ view that once Quebec adopted ss. 40 to 43, it was
    constitutionally required to keep them on the books, so that any modification
    in the type or extent of protection afforded by those provisions would amount
    to a constitutional violation. To accept that submission in these circumstances
    would constitutionalize the policy choice embodied in the first version of the <i>Act</i>,
    improperly shifting the focus of the analysis to the <i>form</i> of the law,
    rather than its effects. <u>Instead, there is a discriminatory impact because,
    assessed on their own and regardless of the prior legislative scheme, the

    reasons below, the effect of the impugned provisions that restrict the
    availability of the remedial conditional sentence option is to perpetuate the
    already existing disadvantage suffered by Aboriginal offenders of being
    sentenced to jail more consistently than other offenders. I note that this
    important explanation by Abella J. also answers the criticism raised by Miller

    offender. As Ms. Sharma states in her factum, the Supreme Court and Parliament
    (through s. 718.2(e)) have recognized that Aboriginal offenders “face a unique
    legacy of dislocation caused by government policies of cultural genocide
    through colonial expansion and residential schools.” In <em>Ipeelee</em>, at
    para. 60, the Supreme Court affirmed: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To be clear, courts must take judicial notice
    of such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential
    schools and how that history continues to translate into lower educational

    and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal

    had he not been precluded from doing so by the <em>Safe Streets and Communities

    approximately a 16-year period, would have been eligible for, and did in
    appropriate cases, receive a conditional sentence disposition”: at para. 242. Based
    on Ms. Sharma’s personal background and current circumstances, including her

    colonialism including systemic racism, educational challenges, lack of
    employment opportunities, loss of and disruption to cultural transmission
    processes, as well as social and economic and property disenfranchisement, and
    other resultant factors leading to disproportionate contact with the criminal

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Limiting, removing or restricting the

  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>Research by Elspeth Kaiser-Derrick offers a
    stark illustration of the impact the [<i>Safe Streets and Communities Act</i>]
    will have on the availability of conditional sentences to Indigenous offenders.
    Kaiser-Derrick reviewed ninety-one cases of Indigenous women offenders to
    assess the ways that courts account for the <i>Gladue</i> factors. Of the
    ninety-one cases that Kaiser-Derrick analyzed between 1999 and 2011, thirty-one
    resulted in conditional sentences. She came to the following startling
    conclusion about how these thirty-one cases would be decided in the wake of the
    [<i>Safe Streets and Communities Act</i>]:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>[“]Following the 2012 s. 742.1 amendments,
    29 of those 31 conditional sentence orders would no longer be possible. That
    bears repeating: either immediately on the law, or because on the facts the
    Crown proceeded by indictment for a hybrid offence now excluded by s. 742.1, 29
    of the 31 Aboriginal women that received conditional sentence orders in my
    research would no longer be eligible for conditional sentences for the same
    offences/facts today. For one further case, I was unable to determine whether
    that offender would remain eligible for a conditional sentence, because the
    answer hinged on whether the Crown proceeded by indictment or summarily, which
    is unclear in the judgment. I only found one decision of the 31 that actually
    resulted in a conditional sentence order that would continue to be eligible for
    a conditional sentence order after the 2012 amendments. To be clear, that means
    that those 29 (possibly 30, depending on the answer for the judgment I could
    not conclusively settle) criminalized Aboriginal women would likely have been
    sent to prison instead under the current 2012 law (although perhaps in limited
    cases a strict probationary term may have been ordered). This regressive turn
    in sentencing law is deeply troubling, and threatens to further exacerbate the
    ongoing problem of overrepresentation.[”] [Footnotes omitted.]</span></p>

    the s. 15 claim was that he observed, at para. 257, that the court had no
    statistical information, and found that the record before him did not identify
    “the real measure and likely or established impact” of any adverse effect in
    order to determine whether it would qualify as a distinction based on Aboriginal
    status. He also stated that restricting the availability of conditional
    sentences for crimes with a maximum sentence of 14 years or life and for certain
    drug offences would have a minimal impact on Aboriginal offenders, and that only
    in “a very few cases” would Aboriginal offenders be incarcerated where a
    conditional sentence would also have been appropriate: at para. 256. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, with respect to the error of law, the
    Supreme Court instructed in <em>Taypotat</em> that while the onus remains on
    the claimant to establish disproportionate and discriminatory effect, “the
    specific evidence required will vary depending on the context of the claim, but
    ‘evidence that goes to establishing a claimant’s historical position of
    disadvantage’ will be relevant”: <em>Taypotat</em>, at para. 21, citing <em>Withler</em>,
    at para. 38. This principle follows the direction in <em>Law v. Canada
    (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, that if
    direct evidence is not available, courts may rely on logical inferences and
    judicial notice: at para. 77. In this case, it was not necessary to lead
    statistical evidence to establish that removing the conditional sentence option
    would disproportionately impact Aboriginal offenders. It was therefore an error
    of law to require that evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In respect of the available evidence, first
    there was the direct evidence of Dr. Murdocca on the link between systemic
    discrimination and overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in the criminal
    justice system in general, and female Aboriginal offenders in particular,
    because of their specific challenges. Dr. Murdocca also provided direct evidence
    of the same link to the participation by Aboriginal women in the crime of
    importing drugs. Second, the sentencing judge was entitled to take judicial
    notice of the phenomenon of overincarceration of Aboriginal offenders and the
    fact that systemic discrimination is recognized as a direct cause of that
    phenomenon in Canada. These matters are beyond any serious controversy, as
    reflected in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court.</span></p>

    regarding how many Aboriginal offenders would have received conditional
    sentences had the impugned provisions not been enacted, they would not have
    presented a useful picture. A worthwhile set of statistics would have
    identified the population of Aboriginal offenders who were incarcerated when
    they otherwise would have been eligible for a conditional sentence. That
    population of offender would have had to receive a sentence of less than two
    years, an eligibility criterion for conditional sentencing: <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    s. 742.1. However, Ms. Sharma was convicted of an offence that attracted a
    mandatory minimum of two years’ imprisonment: <em>CDSA</em>, s. 6(3)(a.1). </span></p>

    sentence in s. 6(3)(a.1) of the <em>CDSA</em>, there would have been no other
    similarly situated offenders who were incarcerated for fewer than two years,
    subject to the limited exception in s. 8 of the <em>CDSA</em>. Statistics would
    accordingly have been unable to capture the impact of the impugned provisions
    on Aboriginal offenders, as it would be difficult to identify the population
    that was specifically deprived of a conditional sentencing option.</span></a></p>

    disadvantage experienced by an Aboriginal offender whose background and
    circumstances, when considered under the <em>Gladue</em> framework, weighed in
    favour of a conditional sentence had one been available. As the impugned
    provisions remove an important tool that would have allowed the sentencing
    judge to give effect to the mandate of s. 718.2(e), this is one of the cases
    foreseen in <em>Taypotat</em> in which direct statistical evidence was not

    sentencing judge, is that the removal of the conditional sentence for the
    affected offences does not have the effect of exacerbating the condition of
    overincarceration of Indigenous offenders and therefore does not implicate
    substantive equality considerations, because sentencing judges retain the
    discretion to order other sentencing options such as a suspended sentence and
    probation. The Crown argues that judges are not prevented from giving effect to
    the remedial objective of s. 718.2(e) and their role as directed by <em>Gladue</em> and <em>Ipeelee</em>. To quote from the Crown’s factum: “Judges are still
    perfectly able to take on that role. They simply have one less tool at their

    of the remedial purpose of s. 15. It is not disputed that the imposition of a
    prison sentence can reflect the proper balancing of the sentencing objectives
    of denunciation, deterrence, and rehabilitation. The<i> <em>Gladue</em></i> framework does not undermine that fundamental premise. Rather, it asks
    sentencing judges to consider imposing a community-based sanction that also
    balances the sentencing objectives but carries with it the added benefit of
    redressing the problem of overrepresentation of Aboriginal offenders in
    Canada’s prisons. It is the denial of this benefit that is at issue in this

    that courts replace conditional sentences with suspended sentences appears to
    fly in the face of Parliament’s stated purpose in enacting the <em>Safe Streets

    that a conditional sentence, unlike a suspended sentence, is a jail sentence
    but served in the community. It serves the functions of deterrence and
    denunciation: <em>Proulx</em>, at paras. 41, 67. Indeed, conditional sentences
    may be available even in cases where deterrence and denunciation are the
    paramount sentencing objectives: <em>R. v. Wells</em>, 2000 SCC 10, [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 207, at para. 35. A suspended sentence, on the other hand, is intended
    to promote rehabilitation and is normally imposed where deterrence and
    denunciation are not needed for the particular offender in the particular
    circumstances, or where there are exceptional circumstances: <em>Proulx</em>,
    at paras. 32-36; see <em>Criminal Code</em>, ss. 731(1), 732.1, and 732.2.</span></p>

    weight on its contention that in the ordinary course, sentencing judges would
    be unlikely to impose conditional sentences for serious offences like those
    captured by ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii). Of course, a conditional sentence
    was never available where the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances of
    the case was two years’ imprisonment or more. It is only in cases where the
    appropriate sentence is less than two years that a conditional sentence is
    available. Therefore, it is only in cases where the offence is one included in
    the ambit of the two impugned sections, but the circumstances of the commission
    of the offence do not call for a penitentiary-length sentence that the impugned
    provisions have removed the option of a conditional sentence. The issue whether
    all the included offences are “serious” is discussed below in the context of s.

    would “deprive s. 718.2(e) of much of its remedial power, given its focus on
    reducing overreliance on incarceration”: <em>Ipeelee</em>, at para. 86. The

    reference letters, education, familial and community support, compliance with

    disproportionately denied bail and are less likely to be rehabilitated in
    custody, as the court in <em>Gladue</em> acknowledged at paras. 65 and 68, they
    are less likely to meet the exceptional circumstances criteria. For example, in
    the 59 cases that were identified by the intervener where a suspended sentence
    was requested, the offender received such a sentence in 27 cases, and in each
    one, the offender was on bail and consequently able to overcome addiction,

    saying that, “because of Indigenous overrepresentation in the criminal justice
    system, <em>any</em> Parliamentary enactment of general application that makes
    the criminal law more stringent <em>necessarily</em> violates s. 15” (emphasis
    in original), and, as a consequence, Parliament can never make the criminal law
    more stringent, only more lenient. For example, a <em>Criminal Code</em> amendment increasing a maximum sentence for a given offence would risk running
    afoul of s. 15 if this court accepted Ms. Sharma’s arguments.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would strongly reject this contention. It is
    based on a misunderstanding of Ms. Sharma’s position and of the s. 15 analysis.
    As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Gladue</em>, the purpose of s. 718.2(e)
    is to address the issue of Aboriginal overincarceration by providing a
    sentencing directive of restraint, a mandate to consider in every case the
    circumstances of an Aboriginal offender because they arise in part from the
    history of systemic discrimination, and an available remedy in s. 742.1 of a
    conditional sentence to be served in the community, where appropriate in all
    the circumstances. By reducing overincarceration, these provisions are intended
    to also affect the larger issue of Aboriginal overrepresentation in the
    criminal justice system. But the provisions are focused directly on sentencing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship between ss. 718.2(e) and 742.1
    in sentencing is well established. The conditional sentence is a central tool given
    to sentencing judges to apply the <em>Gladue</em> factors. By restricting the
    availability of the conditional sentence, the impugned amendments deprive the
    court of an important means to redress systemic discrimination against
    Aboriginal people when considering an appropriate sanction. <em>Criminal Code</em> amendments that make the criminal law more stringent or that increase a maximum
    sentence for an offence would not have the same effect. Sections 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii)
    undermine the purpose of the <em>Gladue</em> framework, exacerbating and
    perpetuating the discriminatory disadvantage of Aboriginal offenders in the
    sentencing process. </span></p>

    accept the Crown’s contention that the impugned provisions of the <em>Safe
    Streets and Communities Act</em><i> </i>do not impair the ability of sentencing
    judges to consider alternatives to imprisonment when sentencing Aboriginal
    offenders. To the contrary, the Act deals a significant blow to the remedial
    policy that Parliament enacted in s. 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.
    When amending remedial policies, Parliament must not do so in a discriminatory
    fashion: <em>Alliance</em>, at paras. 36-37.</span></p>

    offenders convicted of certain offences. The reality is that the Act will
    result in more Indigenous offenders serving their sentences in jail rather than
    in their communities. Thus, I conclude that ss. 742.1(c) and 742.1(e)(ii) deny
    the benefit of a conditional sentence in a manner that has the effect of reinforcing,
    perpetuating or exacerbating the disadvantage of Aboriginal offenders, and is
    therefore contrary to s. 15 of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Arbitrariness asks whether
    there is a direct connection between the purpose of the law and the impugned
    effect on the individual, in the sense that the effect on the individual bears
    some relation to the law’s purpose.&nbsp;There must be a rational connection between
    the object of the measure that causes the s. 7 deprivation, and the limits it
    imposes on life, liberty, or security of the person ([Hamish Stewart, <i>Fundamental
    Justice: Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, 1st ed.<i> </i>(Toronto: Irwin Law, 2012)], at p. 136). A law that imposes limits on these
    interests in a way that bears <i>no connection</i> to its objective arbitrarily
    impinges on those interests. Thus, in [<i>Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>,
    2005 SCC 35, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791], the law was arbitrary because the
    prohibition of private health insurance was held to be unrelated to the
    objective of protecting the public health system.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Overbreadth deals with a
    law that is so broad in scope that it includes <i>some</i> conduct that bears
    no relation to its purpose. In this sense, the law is arbitrary <i>in part</i>.
    At its core, overbreadth addresses the situation where there is no rational
    connection between the purposes of the law and <i>some</i>, but not all, of its
    impacts. For instance, the law at issue in [<i>R. v. Demers</i>, 2004 SCC 46,
    [2004] 2 S.C.R. 489] required unfit accused to attend repeated review board
    hearings. The law was only disconnected from its purpose insofar as it applied
    to permanently unfit accused; for temporarily unfit accused, the effects were
    related to the purpose.</span><span lang=EN-CA> [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

    guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment: <em>R. v. Lloyd</em>, 2016 SCC
    13, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 130, at paras. 40-42. Nevertheless, sentencing legislation
    remains vulnerable to a s. 7 challenge on the basis of overbreadth or
    arbitrariness, as the court accepted in a decision released on the same day as <em>Lloyd:
    R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali</em>, 2016 SCC 14, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 180. As Ms.

    about the intent and purpose of the legislation, I discern that the purpose of
    the two impugned provisions is to maintain the integrity of the justice system
    by ensuring that offenders who commit serious offences receive prison sentences.
    The means by which the legislation implements Parliament’s purpose is by
    removing the availability of a conditional sentence for offences where the
    maximum penalty is 14 years or life or 10 years in the case of offences

    depending on the prosecutorial route chosen. While the majority struck down the
    provision under s. 12 of the <em>Charter</em> and thus found it unnecessary to
    consider whether it also violated s. 7, Moldaver J., in his dissenting reasons,
    would have upheld the provision under both ss. 7 and 12 of the <em>Charter</em>.
    He declined to find the two-year sentencing gap arbitrary for the purposes of
    s. 7 because he was satisfied that prosecutorial discretion would be used
    appropriately to cure any potential arbitrary effect. However, he did not
    “gainsay the possibility that, in other circumstances, this type of gap might
    raise s. 7 concerns”: at para. 191.</span></p>

    objective was to maintain the integrity of the justice system by ensuring that
    offenders who commit serious offences receive jail sentences: where a
    conditional sentence would have been available and imposed in the
    circumstances, sentencing judges will now substitute a prison sentence. To the
    extent that Parliament would view a conditional sentence as the middle of the
    sentencing range, its purpose was to remove that middle option with the intent
    that judges will impose a more stringent, denunciatory, and deterrent sentence.
    The effect of removing the conditional sentence option is not arbitrary because
    it coincides with Parliament’s purpose.</span></p>

    violate s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>because they are overbroad. Although
    the purpose of the amendments was to ensure that serious offences would always
    attract a custodial sentence, the provisions identify seriousness by focusing
    on the maximum sentence for an offence (14 years or life imprisonment, or 10
    years for drug offences involving importing, exporting, trafficking or
    production) and consequently capture a broad spectrum of offences and
    underlying criminal conduct that can range from the low to the high end of
    seriousness or gravity. In other words, Ms. Sharma submits that the maximum
    sentence for an offence is not an appropriate proxy for its seriousness.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Sharma argues that the purpose of providing a
    significant maximum sentence for many offences in the <em>Criminal Code</em> is
    to have that sentence available for egregious cases and circumstances that
    could arise. It does not indicate that the underlying prohibited conduct is
    always or even most often going to call for such a sentence. As a result, using
    a high maximum sentence as a proxy for the seriousness of the offence and the
    crime is not reasonable and results in overbreadth.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Sharma suggests that there are a number of effective
    and reasonable methods that could have been used to identify serious offences. For
    instance, a constitutionally valid mandatory minimum is one indicator of the
    seriousness of an offence: even where the circumstances are particularly
    sympathetic, the offence is so serious that the minimum sentence is not
    inappropriate. Another method that Parliament has used is to classify an
    offence, such as theft, assault and sexual assault, by tiers of severity,
    thereby subjecting conduct at the serious end of the spectrum to its own
    sentencing regime. A third method is for Parliament to designate certain
    aggravating features, such as terrorism, as always serious. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, by using the maximum sentence to designate
    serious offences that require a custodial sentence, Ms. Sharma submits that the
    legislation includes a number of offences which, while by no means trivial,
    often attract a low sentence. Counsel for Ms. Sharma researched sentences
    imposed for five offences for which a conditional sentence is no longer
    available because they are punishable by a maximum term of 14 years’
    imprisonment – forging a passport and possession of counterfeit money contrary
    to the <em>Criminal Code</em>, and price-fixing, false advertising, and
    deceptive telemarketing contrary to the <em>Competition Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985,
    c. C-34 – and found that the longest sentence imposed for any of them was two
    years (for deceptive telemarketing). The breadth of the sentencing range
    available for the included offences and the sentences actually imposed for such
    offences show that they are not always the type of serious offence that the
    impugned provisions were intended to affect.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s position is that Parliament’s
    purpose was to remove the conditional sentence option for serious offences and
    that the impugned provisions are therefore rationally connected to the
    amendments’ purpose. As discussed in the previous section, however, that
    position conflates the purpose of the legislation, to maintain the integrity of
    the justice system by ensuring that offenders who commit serious offences
    receive jail sentences, with the means used to accomplish it, which is the
    removal of the conditional sentence option for offences punishable by high
    maximum penalties. </span></p>

    offences are serious, the Crown argues that Parliament was entitled to use the
    maximum sentence to determine the seriousness of the offence in a generic
    sense, referring to <em>R. v. Hamilton</em> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at
    para. 90, regardless of the underlying conduct of any particular offender. I

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since the inception of conditional sentences,
    this mode of punishment has been subject to two internal limits: the offence
    must not have attracted a mandatory minimum sentence, and the sentencing judge
    must have determined that a fit sentence for the offender would be less than
    two years in prison. On the surface, the <em>Safe Streets and Communities Act</em> amendments purport to restrict the availability of conditional sentences for
    certain classes of offences. However, the practical impact of the legislation
    is to alter the sentencing landscape most directly for those offenders
    convicted of an offence with a high maximum penalty who nevertheless deserved penalties
    at the low end of the sentencing range, by denying those offenders the
    availability of a conditional sentence. For more serious offenders who would
    ordinarily have received a prison sentence exceeding two years, the <em>Safe
    Streets and Communities Act</em> has no effect on the sentencing landscape, as
    those offenders could not have received conditional sentences to begin with.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this respect, the impact of ss. 742.1(c) and
    742.1(e)(ii) is similar in scope to the impact of the impugned legislation in <em>Safarzadeh-Markhali</em>.
    That case concerned s. 719(3.1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which denied
    enhanced sentencing credit for days spent in pre-trial detention to an offender
    who was refused bail because of previous convictions, and that was endorsed on
    the offender’s record pursuant to s. 515(9.1). Writing for a unanimous court, McLachlin
    C.J. found that the legislative purpose of s. 719(3.1) was to “to enhance <span
style='color:black'>public safety and security by increasing violent and
    chronic offenders’ access to rehabilitation programs</span><span
style='color:black'>” (emphasis omitted): at para. 47. At para. 53, she held
    that the law was overbroad because it applied to offenders in circumstances
    that did not further the legislative purpose:</span></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>First, the provision’s
    ambit captures people it was not intended to capture: offenders who do not pose
    a threat to public safety or security. Section 515(9.1) is broadly worded. It
    catches any person denied bail primarily for a criminal record, without
    specifying or even broadly identifying the nature or number of offences that
    would warrant a s. 515(9.1) endorsement. The section may therefore ensnare
    persons whose imprisonment does not advance the purpose of the law. For
    example, a person with two or three convictions for failing to appear in court
    might be subject to a s. 515(9.1) endorsement, even though he or she did not
    pose any real threat to public safety or security. And even if such a person
    receives greater access to rehabilitative programming and benefits from it, the
    consequence is not necessarily to improve public safety and security. In short,
    a s. 515(9.1) endorsement is an inexact proxy for the danger that an offender
    poses to public safety and security. The Crown says the law casts the net
    broadly because targeting all offenders with a criminal record is a more practical
    option than attempting to identify only offenders who pose a risk to public
    safety and security. But practicality is no answer to a charge of overbreadth
    under s. 7: <i>Bedford</i>, at para. 113. </span></p>

    precisely tailored to their purpose than the legislation at issue in <em>Safarzadeh-Markhali</em>.
    As discussed, in a practical sense, the only offenders who face an altered
    sentencing regime by virtue of the <em>Safe Streets and Communities Act</em> amendments are those whose circumstances would ordinarily militate in favour of
    a sentence at the lower end of the spectrum. While there will be cases where eliminating
    the availability of a sentence served in the community and mandating a sentence
    of imprisonment could meet Parliament’s purpose of incarcerating those who
    commit serious crimes, there will be many other cases where, as in <em>Safarzadeh-Markhali</em>,
    the impugned provisions will impact people they were not intended to capture.</span></p>

    to impose jail sentences on offenders convicted of the designated offences,
    whether or not the circumstances of the crime made their conduct serious

    review of the sources for determining Parliament’s intent, as discussed above,
    which was to ensure that offenders convicted of serious crimes serve their
    sentences in prison. The intent of the amendments was to promote the integrity
    of the administration of justice and the public’s confidence in it by ensuring
    that serious crimes are punished with a sufficiently strong sentence, which
    Parliament deems to be a sentence of incarceration. </span></p>

    reasoning in <em>Hamilton</em> provides a foundation for the use of maximum
    penalties as a proxy for an offence’s seriousness is inconsistent with this
    court’s reasoning in that case and misconceives the sentencing process. In <em>Hamilton</em>,
    the issue was the determination of a fit sentence for the offence of importing
    cocaine. In setting out the analytical framework, Doherty J.A. considered the
    proportionality requirement under s. 718.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, which
    provides that “[a] sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence
    and the degree of responsibility of the offender.” He stated, at para. 90, that
    the gravity of the offence is a product of both the potential penalty imposed
    and the specific features of the commission of the crime:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The “gravity of the offence” refers to the
    seriousness of the offence in a generic sense as reflected by the potential
    penalty imposed by Parliament and <u>any specific features of the commission of
    the crime</u> which may tend to increase or decrease the harm or risk of harm
    to the community occasioned by the offence. For example, in drug importation
    cases, the nature and quantity of the drug involved will impact on the gravity
    of the offence. Some of the factors which increase the gravity of the offence
    are set out in s. 718.2(a). [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>He continued, at para. 91, by explaining that “the degree of
    responsibility of the offender” addresses the offender’s role in carrying out
    the crime, as well as “a<span style='color:black;background:white'>ny specific
    aspects of the offender's conduct or background that tend to increase or

lang=EN-CA>When read in context, Doherty J.A.’s acknowledgement that the
    maximum penalty for an offence can reflect its seriousness in a generic sense
    was tempered significantly by his concurrent observation that the actual
    circumstances in which a specific offender committed a specific offence will
    play a critical role in the determination of seriousness. This description is
    consistent with the sentencing framework in the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>and
    Ms. Sharma’s submission that the seriousness of a crime is not determined solely
    by the maximum penalty, viewed in isolation. Sentencing is not an abstract inquiry
    and cannot be divorced from the circumstances of the commission of the crime,
    which will reduce or increase the level of seriousness of the offence in any
    particular case. Furthermore, I observe that the jurisprudence reflects that while
    maximum penalties are not reserved for some abstract conception of the worst
    possible offender, they are nevertheless rarely imposed: <em>R. v. Cheddesingh</em>,
    2004 SCC 16, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 433, at para. 1; <em>R. v. L.M.</em>, 2008 SCC 31,

lang=EN-CA>Ms. Sharma sought to distinguish the case of <em>Canada (Minister of
    Employment and Immigration) v. Chiarelli</em>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711, in which the
    Supreme Court found that a provision of the <em>Immigration Act</em></span><i><span
lang=EN-GB>, 1976</span></i><span lang=EN-GB>, S.C. 1976&#8209;77, c. 52,</span><span
lang=EN-CA> did not violate the principles of fundamental justice by using
    conviction of an offence with a maximum penalty of five years or more as a
    proxy for “serious criminality”, so as to prevent a permanent resident from
    remaining in Canada. I agree that that decision is distinguishable. First, the parties
    in <em>Chiarelli</em> did not frame their submissions with reference to the principles
    of fundamental justice that have since crystallized in the jurisprudence and
    that are raised in this appeal. The court therefore did not address the issue
    in terms of comparing the purpose of the law with the scope of its impugned
    effects. Second, that case turned on the proposition that Parliament was
    entitled to adopt an immigration policy to regulate non-citizens’ rights to
    enter and remain in Canada, and that it was not unfair to deport a person for a
    crime punishable by five years in prison when that was a known condition for
    remaining in Canada: at pp. 733-34. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>I note, further, that the relevant immigration legislation, in its
    modern form, includes as grounds of inadmissibility not only the maximum
    penalty for an offence, but also the length of the prison term actually imposed
    on the permanent resident or foreign national: see <em>Immigration and Refugee
    Protection Act</em>, s. 36(1)(a). The latter measure is intended as a proxy for
    serious criminality: see <em>Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency
    Preparedness)</em>, 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289, at para. 25.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Finally, the Crown also submits that the legislation is not overly
    broad in respect of the offence in issue in this appeal to which Ms. Sharma pleaded
    guilty, importing cocaine, or the offence of aggravated sexual assault, which
    was specifically addressed by the interveners HIV &amp; AIDS Legal Clinic
    Ontario and Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network. In respect of importing cocaine,
    the Crown argues that the need for denunciation and deterrence justifies the
    removal of the conditional sentence option. In the case of aggravated sexual
    assault, which the interveners argue can be committed by non-disclosure of HIV
    even where the accused takes precautions to prevent transmission and
    transmission does not occur, the Crown submits that the lesser sentences of a
    suspended sentence, an intermittent sentence, and a fine are still available
    for less blameworthy cases.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>With respect, in making that argument, the Crown mischaracterizes the
    conditional sentence as a form of punishment that carries no deterrent or
    denunciatory effect. Even in cases where deterrence and denunciation are the
    paramount sentencing objectives, a conditional sentence may be appropriate,
    depending on “the nature of the conditions imposed, the duration of the
    conditional sentence, and the circumstances of the offender and the community
    in which the conditional sentence is to be served”: <em>Proulx</em>, at para.
    114; see also <em>Wells</em>, at para. 35. These principles apply equally to
    the offences of drug importation and aggravated sexual assault.</span></p>

    Crown where the impugned provisions are overbroad in respect of any of the
    included offences. In <em>Bedford</em>, the court stated that the s. 7 analysis
    regarding arbitrariness, overbreadth, and gross disproportionality is qualitative,

    from <em>Charter</em> non-compliance: at paras. 35-36. Similar paths could
    apply, with appropriate modification, to the impugned provisions of the <em>Safe

    experience in foster care, her lack of education and poverty, as well as her
    determination to re-educate herself and work to make a good home for her

    bedrock constitutional principle that a Parliament cannot bind its successor: <em>Reference

    Ordinary legislation is never immune from amendment or repeal. An

    from amendment or repeal, subject only to s. 1 – something has gone seriously
    wrong with s. 15(1) doctrine. What that problem is, and how to fix it, is at

    conception of discrimination articulated in <em>Kahkewistahaw First Nation v.

    of s. 15(1) doctrine since its emergence in <em>Andrews v. Law Society of
    British Columbia</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143. On this new conception, the
    imposition or maintenance of a burden of any kind is stipulated as sufficient
    basis for establishing an infringement of s. 15(1), without regard to the
    essential question of whether that burden has resulted from any sort of wrong –
    whether intentional or not – on the part of the legislature. This question,
    which requires that the claim of discrimination be assessed within the
    decision-making context, must remain if s. 15(1) analysis is to be a
    substantive inquiry into wrongful discrimination.</span></p>

    reform was undertaken simultaneously with another: a statutory direction to
    sentencing judges to prioritize alternatives to incarcerating all offenders,

    offences and some offenders, a conditional sentence will not be an available

    some of the discretion previously exercised by sentencing judges. Parliament
    determined that for some offences, justice will require incarceration, a more
    complete deprivation of the offender’s range of freedom, regardless of what a
    sentencing judge may otherwise have concluded. This legislation is an exercise
    of one of Parliament’s most important functions – setting the boundaries of the

    these doctrines, it is inadequate to simply take a snapshot of doctrine as it
    has been formulated in the most recent judgments of the Supreme Court. As later
    judgments build on or modify propositions established in earlier cases,
    contemporary doctrine in this area of law cannot be properly understood without
    attention to the course of doctrinal development. Accordingly, I begin with a
    brief doctrinal history of s. 15(1), including its interaction with s. 1. I
    then apply that doctrine to the issues on this appeal, before turning finally

    disagree not only about the meaning of these concepts, but about the criteria

    equality in particular, McIntyre J. remarked that it is “an elusive concept

    associated with Aristotle, that the court intended to use as a contrast. The
    difference between the two is either merely terminological, or is rooted in a
    misunderstanding of formal equality. As explained below, the <em>Andrews</em> court erred in its supposition that formal equality precluded assessment of the <u>substance</u> of a legislative provision, and was concerned only with the
    question of whether legislation – whatever its justice or injustice – was <u>applied</u> impartially. Substantive equality was proposed by the Supreme Court as a
    corrective: to direct that the substance of legislation should also be subject
    to scrutiny. But this is a proposition that formal equality never denied. Once

    to happen: see Sophia Moreau, “What is Discrimination?” (2010) 38:2 Philosophy
    &amp; Public Affairs 143, at pp. 158-60. The prohibition of indirect

    disadvantageous effect was neither desired nor foreseen. There need not be any
    discriminatory intention, or contempt, or animus toward the affected group. It can

    direct discrimination. Its wrongfulness, however, turns on a contextual

    automatically by the finding that legislation has negatively (or even disproportionately)

    category. This standard of culpability would make indirect discrimination akin
    to absolute liability. Indirect discrimination is better understood as a
    failure either to notice the impact of its actions on others, or to accord that
    impact sufficient weight in its deliberations. The analysis requires attention
    to the public good to be achieved through the legislation, and whether it can
    fairly be said that the legislature – in accepting the unintended side-effects
    of the legislation on the claimant group – thereby failed to treat them as
    persons, “equally capable and equally deserving of concern, respect and
    consideration”: <em>Law</em>,<i> </i>at para. 51. It bears repeating that where
    the complaint of indirect discrimination is based on the legislature failing to
    give appropriate weight to the interests of an historically disadvantaged
    group, the argument cannot be assessed without attending carefully to the full
    legislative context: the balance of burdens and benefits the legislation seeks

    is <u>wrongful</u>. In the case of this claim of indirect discrimination, the

    would not be eligible for conditional sentences. A side-effect of this

    available universally. Most prominent among its restrictions is that
    conditional sentences are not available for any offence that attracts a
    mandatory minimum sentence or where the court imposes a sentence of
    imprisonment of two years or more. Undoubtedly, there are many Aboriginal
    offenders who, but for these restrictions, would receive conditional sentences
    instead of incarceration. Do these, and many other, restrictions on the

    problem of principle that cannot be avoided. On the logic of <em>Taypotat</em>,
    it would seem there could be <u>no</u> constitutionally permissible
    restrictions on the availability of conditional sentences whatsoever. Every
    conceivable restriction would exclude some offenders, and necessarily some
    Aboriginal offenders. Every Aboriginal offender who would be denied a
    conditional sentence because of the operation of a statutory restriction would
    contribute to overincarceration, constituting a disadvantage and an
    infringement of s. 15(1). Nothing short of unlimited availability of
    conditional sentences for all Aboriginal offenders, for all offences, would

    whether a person or group has suffered wrongful discrimination, in the sense of

    criteria. To avoid this analysis – and move straight to s. 1 and the

    disadvantage as overincarceration of Aboriginal offenders. General
    overincarceration is the normative judgment that the state (both as a result of
    legislation and judicial sentencing decisions) has historically over-used
    incarceration as a sanction, and that its use should be reduced: <em>R. v.
    Gladue</em>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, at paras. 52-57. Parliament intended to
    remedy general overincarceration with the requirement in s. 718.2(e) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> that “all available sanctions […] that are reasonable in the
    circumstances” should be considered in priority to imprisonment. This is a
    provision of broad application, but it also has specific language separately
    addressing the situation of Aboriginal offenders: sentencing judges are
    required to pay “particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal
    offenders”.</span></p>

    718.2(e), although it is remedial – meaning that its enactment was intended to
    effect a change in the law and not merely codify the law as it existed – does
    not therefore have constitutional status. Just as the state of the law was
    changed through the enactment of s. 718.2(e) and its interpretation in <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>and subsequent cases, these propositions of law are themselves subject to
    change through subsequent legislative enactments such as the <em>Safe Streets
    and Communities Act</em>. </span></p>

    fixed category. What was an available sanction prior to the adoption of the <em>Safe
    Streets and Communities Act</em> became an unavailable sanction. The effect of
    the Act’s amendments was an increase in incarceration for both Aboriginal and
    non-Aboriginal offenders. The salient question is whether these changes are
    contrary to the <em>Charter</em>. I disagree with my colleague over the
    proposition that legislation that restricts the application of a “remedial”
    regime is inherently discriminatory and wrongful.</span></p>

    two dimensions. One is the normative judgment underlying s. 718.2(e): courts
    have over-relied on incarceration generally and, as a requirement of justice,
    should use alternatives where available. Although overincarceration in this
    sense is an injustice, it is not the specific injustice of discrimination or
    failure to respect equality.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[252]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A second type of Aboriginal overincarceration is
    comparative and does invite discrimination-based scrutiny. It is based on the
    empirical observation that Aboriginal offenders as a group have tended to
    receive more and longer custodial sentences than non-Aboriginal offenders for
    the same offences. Redressing this type of overincarceration has been a
    priority for both Parliament and the judiciary. In <em>Gladue</em> and in <em>R.
    v. Ipeelee</em>, 2012 SCC 13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, the Supreme Court directed
    sentencing judges to be alive to systemic discrimination in sentencing,
    particularly the problem that facially neutral sentencing criteria themselves
    may systemically disadvantage Aboriginal offenders. One contributor to
    Aboriginal overincarceration has been the disproportionate difficulty faced by
    Aboriginal offenders in satisfying the material and other conditions necessary
    for conditional sentences.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[253]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>My colleague draws the conclusion that because
    the appellant would likely have received a conditional sentence had one been
    available prior to the enactment of the <em>Safe Street and Communities Act</em>,
    but was instead incarcerated, her incarceration exacerbated the overall
    phenomenon of Aboriginal overincarceration, which constitutes disadvantage and
    is therefore an infringement of s. 15(1). </span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[254]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I cannot agree. Statistical overincarceration,
    of course, is profoundly suggestive of injustice. Where some group of offenders
    consistently receives harsher treatment than others, something is wrong. But
    further analysis is required to determine what that wrong is. The wrong is not
    in the <u>number</u> of incarcerated offenders, such that every addition to
    that number is itself a wrong, or any subtraction an amelioration of the wrong.
    Consider: legislation directing that all Aboriginal offenders should
    automatically receive conditional sentences if they satisfy some arbitrary
    criteria, such as being left-handed, would <u>reduce</u> the absolute numbers
    of Aboriginal offenders incarcerated. In an attenuated sense it would reduce
    overincarceration. But given that it would do nothing to address the
    identification and remediation of the actual wrongs committed at the sentencing
    stage – wrongs evidenced by statistical overincarceration – it would not
    address overincarceration in a substantive sense. It would be an error to
    conclude from a bare statistic – a change in the absolute numbers incarcerated
    – that the legislative change producing that consequence is either ameliorative
    or productive of wrongful discrimination. </span></p>

    or in which circumstances. Whether this decision limits s. 15(1) rights is not

    the numbers of Aboriginal offenders incarcerated would therefore also rise, did
    the legislature treat Aboriginal offenders as though they were not the equals

    even put to Parliament in committee and in debates in Parliament. My colleague
    objects that no answer was received: at para. 55. But the answer was the
    legislation. Parliament was under no duty to consult or to provide reasons. In
    deciding not to carve out any exemption for Aboriginal offenders, Parliament
    made the decision that for these and other serious offences, justice required
    that all offenders receive a sentence of incarceration. Nothing in this
    decision “widens the gap” between the appellant and any other offender charged
    with the same offences, treats the appellant as a means to an end, or treats
    the appellant in a manner that denies her agency or equality. The unfortunate
    reality is that many persons in Canada have suffered wrongs and deprivations
    similar to those suffered by the appellant. Many have been confronted with
    terrible options. But not all persons, and not all Aboriginal persons, have
    made the choice to participate in a scheme of drug importation.</span></p>

    community. Parliament’s reasoning is categorical: offenders who choose to
    engage in drug trafficking crimes – whether they do so from circumstances of
    poverty or riches – inflict harm on their communities, seize advantages for
    themselves, and thus upset the balance of benefits and burdens in a way that
    can only be restored through a focus on deterrence and denunciation, and the
    imposition of the more extreme deprivation of liberty that comes with

    mind that at this stage of the analysis there has been no finding that anyone’s <em>Charter</em> rights have been violated, and the s. 1 inquiry is not as to
    whether the state was justified in violating a <em>Charter</em> right.</span></p>

    appellant is that she has been more thoroughly deprived of her liberty than she

    legislation requires an assessment of its function in maintaining a social
    order. Benefits that are common to all in a society necessarily appear more

    legislative provisions is the judgment that persons who commit certain offences
    ought to be punished by means of incarceration. It is a judgment about what
    justice requires, taking into account (with respect to drug trafficking and
    importing) the enormous financial incentives and the incalculable human misery
    caused by those who facilitate drug addiction. It is a judgment that individual
    circumstances, including indigeneity, are irrelevant to the determination that
    a fit and proper sentence for such offences include some term of incarceration.
    Although addressing race-based disadvantage has itself been identified by
    Parliament as an important legislative objective, it is not the only objective
    to which Parliament must have regard, and it is subject to limits. I cannot
    find that in limiting the reach of conditional sentences in the way that it
    did, for the purposes that it did, Parliament acted unreasonably.</span></p>

    provided evidence in support of its position on s. 1: at para. 177. I am not
    clear about what the nature of such evidence would be. As McLachlin C.J. noted
    in <em>R. v. Sharpe</em>, 2001 SCC 2, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45 – echoing Aristotle’s
    injunction in Book 1 of <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em><i> </i>“to look for
    precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject
    admits” – “the courts cannot hold Parliament to a higher standard of proof than
    the subject matter admits of”: at para. 89. The legislation at issue in this
    appeal is based on a normative proposition, not an empirical one: that
    conditional sentences are too freely available for offences that require a more
    severe punishment. Reasonable people may disagree as to whether this is a good
    policy judgment or a poor one. That is to be expected. This disagreement may
    give rise to further legislative change. But the question is for Parliament,
    not the court. Even if the law is in some ways misguided, it is not on the
    basis of a failure to respect anyone’s right to equal treatment and equal
    benefit of the law, which is what frames both the s. 15(1) analysis and the
    analysis of whether the limit defining that particular right is justified.</span></p>

    colleague’s framing of the s. 7 analysis and, as explained above, her
    characterization of the objective of the legislation. I also agree with her
    analysis and conclusion that the impugned legislation is not arbitrary and does
    not, for that reason, deprive the appellant of liberty in a manner that does
    not accord with principles of fundamental justice.</span></p>

    conclusion that the impugned legislation offends the principle of overbreadth.
    An overbroad law is one that is “so broad in scope that it includes <i>some</i> conduct that bears no relation to its purpose” (emphasis in original): <em>Canada
    (Attorney General) v. Bedford</em>, 2013 SCC 72, [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at para.
    112. The purpose of the impugned provisions is to ensure that offenders who
    commit serious crimes receive fit sentences, deemed to include a period of
    incarceration. What constitutes a serious crime is of course debatable. But
    Parliament has sought to make the law determinant by reference to offences
    punishable by maximum periods of incarceration of 10 years and 14 years. It
    adopts, as the rough indicia of seriousness, the classifications previously
    made by Parliament in assigning maximum sentences. I would not subordinate
    Parliament’s assessment of the seriousness of these offences to my own.</span></p>
