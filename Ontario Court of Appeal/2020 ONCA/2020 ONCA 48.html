    April 25, 2017 by Justice Mark L. Edwards of the Superior Court of Justice,
    with reasons for sentence reported at 2017 ONSC 2550.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was found guilty of sexual assault
    and sexual interference. He was sentenced to 40 months’ custody and was given
    no credit for time spent under house arrest awaiting trial. He appeals both the
    conviction and sentence. At the conclusion of oral submissions, we advised the
    parties that the appeal was dismissed with reasons to follow. These are the
    reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the appellant
    sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl whom he had employed for a few days. The
    complainant testified that she and her 19-year-old friend went to the
    appellant’s hotel room to get paid. He poured her a drink, which she believed
    was whisky. She left and consumed more alcohol and ingested drugs before
    returning to the hotel room where her 19-year old friend had remained. Thereafter,
    she had no memory of what occurred until she awoke in the hotel room and found
    the appellant on top of her having sexual intercourse. She ran out of the room
    naked and screaming. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The hotel security video shows the complainant
    running out of the hotel room naked. In addition, a witness saw her collapsed
    under a tree near the hotel, crying and screaming. Her friend also testified
    that shortly after, the complainant was distraught, repeating: “he raped me”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>No forensic evidence linked the appellant to the
    complainant, although DNA swabs had been taken from both of them. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals on the basis that the trial
    judge erred in relying on the statement made to the complainant’s friend, “he
    raped me”, for the truth of its contents. This statement, he submits, was
    hearsay and not possible to admit as <em>res gestae</em> because it was made 20
    minutes after the complainant left the hotel room. He also contends that it was
    an inadmissible prior consistent statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree. The act of making the statement
    was part of the complainant’s distressed reaction to the events that had
    happened shortly before. The fact she made that statement was therefore
    admissible as part of the narrative and properly before the court. There is no
    basis for concluding that the trial judge relied upon the statement for the
    truth of its contents, or for its consistency with subsequent statements. It
    was in his summary of evidence that the trial judge referred to this statement.
    He did not do so in his analysis. In the analysis portion of his decision, the
    trial judge made clear that he accepted the complainant’s evidence primarily
    because of the independent security video showing her leaving the hotel room
    naked and hysterical and the evidence of the independent witness who saw her
    under the tree. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant further submits that the trial
    judge erred by concluding, in the absence of forensic evidence, that
    intercourse had taken place. He characterizes this as a <em>W.(D.)</em> error
    because the trial judge did not directly advert to the second part of the test: <em>R. v. W.(D.), </em>[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Again, we do not agree. The trial judge
    commented on the absence of forensic evidence establishing intercourse, saying,
    “The fact that such evidence was not presented to the Court does not mean that
    the Crown has failed to prove the case against Mr. DiMichele beyond a
    reasonable doubt.” This passage makes clear that the trial judge concluded that
    the absence of forensic proof of intercourse did not raise a reasonable doubt. He
    also found that the Crown’s evidence as a whole established guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt. He was entitled to come to this conclusion. There was no
    basis on the evidence for concluding that the absence of forensic evidence
    casts meaningful doubt on whether intercourse occurred. Moreover, in this case
    the complainant showered before the forensic testing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree that the sentence of 40 months
    was manifestly unfit. The sentence was fit and within the appropriate range in
    light of: the nature of the assault; the age of the complainant; the position
    of trust the appellant was in (as her employer, albeit for a very short time);
    and the fact that the appellant had a prior criminal record for unrelated
    offences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While the trial judge did not give the appellant credit for time
    spent on restrictive bail conditions, this was because, as the trial judge
    noted, he had breached his bail conditions by consuming alcohol and driving
    while under the influence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The conviction appeal is dismissed. Leave to appeal the sentence is
    allowed, but the sentence appeal is dismissed. </span></p>
