    union against York, they engaged in conduct that the York University Tribunal
    found warranted discipline under York’s <i>Code of Student Rights and
    Responsibilities</i>, despite s. 17(4) of the <i>Back to Class Act (York
    University), 2018</i>, S.O. 2018, c. 10, Sch. 3, which states: “Any dispute
    between the parties concerning discharge or discipline in respect of activities
    that took place [during the strike period] shall be determined through the
    grievance procedure and arbitration procedure established in the new collective
    agreement.” </span></p>

    the respondents were upheld by the York University Appeal Panel. The
    respondents did not appeal the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction; instead,
    they brought an application for judicial review of that decision. The
    Divisional Court allowed the respondents’ application for judicial review on
    the basis that a labour arbitrator had exclusive jurisdiction over their discipline.
    A panel of this court granted leave to appeal from that decision.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court's approach to an appeal from the
    Divisional Court on an administrative law matter is to step into the shoes of
    the lower court and focus on the decision of the tribunal under review: <i>Agraira
    v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)</i>, <span
style='background:white'>2013 SCC 36</span>, <span style='background:white'>[2013]

    Diafwila</i>, <span style='background:white'>2016 ONCA 627</span>, at para. 51.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> </span><span lang=EN-CA>This court does not owe deference to a

    that the standard of review to be applied to the Tribunal’s jurisdictional
    decision was reasonableness, but now accepts that the standard is correctness
    because the appeal raises “questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries
    between two or more administrative bodies”: </span><i><span lang=EN-CA

lang=EN-CA> 441 D.L.R. (4th) 1, at paras. 17, 53, 63-64, 69. As the majority
    instructed in <i>Vavilov</i>, this court “may choose either to uphold the
    administrative decision maker’s determination or to substitute its own view”
    (citations omitted): at para. 54. The majority added that: “While it should
    take the administrative decision maker’s reasoning into account – and indeed,
    it may find that reasoning persuasive and adopt it – the reviewing court is
    ultimately empowered to come to its own conclusions on the question”: <i>Vavilov</i>,
    at para. 54; see also<b> </b><i>Bell Canada v. Canada (A.G.)</i>, 2019 SCC 66, 441

    Commissioner, wrote the Report that led to the </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Back
    to Class Act</span></i><span lang=EN-CA>. He noted that “since 1998, York has
    negotiated 79 collective agreements, and the only labour disputes – meaning
    strikes – involve Local 3903”: Ontario, <i>Report In the Matter of an
    Industrial Inquiry Commission Pursuant to Section 37 of the Labour Relations
    Act, 1995 and In the Matter of the Negotiation of New Collective Agreements to
    Replace the Ones that Expired on August 31, 2017 </i>(Toronto: Labour, Training
    and Skills Development, 2018) (William Kaplan), at p. 7. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>He accepted York’s submission that “the current dispute was part of
    a pattern – a pattern of acrimony and labour disruptions that it experienced
    with none of its other bargaining units”: at pp. 5, 9. Mr. Kaplan concluded
    that the strike could only be resolved by interest arbitration, adding his
    observation that “the union’s bargaining parameters and culture [are] … not
    normative”: at p. 8.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This case bears the unfortunate marks of that unusual
    and longstanding pattern of acrimony. The protagonists in the dispute are York
    and the Union, representing the respondents. Both sides had legal representation.
    The parties’ moves in the unfolding of their struggle for dominance were
    strategic at every step – in the selection of the forums, the timing of procedural
    thrusts, and the language and substance of the submissions, to mention only a
    few. The Union has resolutely opposed the idea that a York-controlled tribunal
    could determine the fate of its members, and York has resolutely opposed the idea
    that an outside tribunal should review its decisions.</span></p>

    strike ended, Ms. McAulay filed complaints against the respondents with York’s
    Office of Student Community Relations (“OSCR”) under the <i>Student Code</i>.
    The <i>Code</i> applies to non-academic student conduct on-campus; it also
    applies off-campus if the conduct in question has a real and substantial link

lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. McAulay complained that the respondents had engaged

    2018 and July 7, 2018 when they participated in strike-related protests and
    secondary picketing at York and at off-campus locations. Despite her senior
    position, Ms. McAulay asserted that she made the complaints as a representative

    tracked the arguments made to the Divisional Court and this court by counsel. However,

    as teaching assistants was dependent upon their being York students. The
    Tribunal acknowledged that the conduct at issue occurred during a labour
    disruption but did not accept the argument that any conduct during a strike by
    an employed York graduate student was a labour issue to be governed solely by
    the collective agreement. The Tribunal considered that the respondents’ unionized
    status did not supersede their independent responsibilities as students under
    the <i>Student Code</i>, and held: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The essential character of this case is that
    the purported actions of students … are alleged to be in violation of the [<i>Code</i>];
    it does not arise from the collective agreement. The fact that the alleged
    breaches of the [<i>Code</i>] occurred during a time of heightened tensions at
    York University, or that the [respondents] are members of a labour union, does
    not remove the responsibilities of students under the [<i>Code</i>] or the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While the [Tribunal] recognizes that the
    conduct giving rise to the complaints occurred during a labour disruption, the
    [Tribunal] finds that student conduct must continue to be governed by the [<i>Code</i>]
    during a labour disruption. The [respondents’] characterization of the conduct
    as “picketing by striking employees” does not eliminate their responsibilities
    as students under the <i>Code</i>. </span></p>

    Mr.&nbsp;Weber sued the employer for alleged torts, including trespass, and
    also under the <i>Charter</i>: at paras. 33-35. The Supreme Court considered
    three models for addressing the question of jurisdiction: concurrent,

    and free to proceed, even if the dispute “arises in the employment context”: at
    para. 39. This model would have allowed Mr. Weber, for example, to proceed with
    his trespass action in Superior Court, regardless of the collective agreement. The
    overlapping model uses the metaphor of “overlapping spheres” under which a
    court action can be brought if the issues raised “go beyond the traditional
    subject matter of labour law”: at para.&nbsp;47. Mr. Weber argued that the
    trespass and torts pleaded in his action went “beyond the parameters of the
    collective agreement”: at para. 47. Under the exclusive jurisdiction model, the
    labour arbitrator has jurisdiction to the exclusion of the court: at para. 50. These
    descriptions apply, with necessary modifications, when the jurisdictional contest

    [1986] 1 S.C.R. 704, on the basis that “mandatory arbitration clauses in labour
    statutes deprive the courts of concurrent jurisdiction”: at para. 41. The court
    also rejected it because concurrency would not be consistent with the language of
    the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, which required “all <u>differences</u> between
    the parties arising from the interpretation, application, administration or
    alleged violation of the agreement” to be referred to arbitration (emphasis in
    original): at para. 45. Lastly, giving effect to the concurrent model would “[undercut]

    parallel proceedings are to be discouraged: at para. 49. This court reiterated
    this stance against parallel proceedings in <i>Naraine</i>: “<i>Weber </i>stands
    for the proposition that when several related issues emanate from a workplace

    overlapping litigation in the courts”: at para. 58. This pattern has not since

    pre-contractual negotiation of that agreement”: at para. 24. The court also noted
    the incongruity of the union prosecuting a grievance when it was one of the
    parties against which the teachers had lodged the complaint: at para. 28. The

    engages discipline that relates to the respondents in their capacity as
    students, not as employees. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellant points out that York’s
    ability to impose discipline is not “clearly excluded by the other statutory
    provisions” in the <i>Back to Class Act</i> and in the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>.
    She adds that n</span><span lang=EN-CA>othing in the <i>York University Act</i> suggests that this authority to discipline students does not apply to students “who
    engage in misconduct during civil protests just because they are also acting in
    their capacity as University employees.” To the contrary, the appellant notes
    that the <i>Student Code</i>, established under s. 13(2)(c) of the <i>York
    University Act</i>, expressly contemplates that the Tribunal will have
    jurisdiction over the conduct of student-employees during strikes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Fourth, </span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant submits that the
    Tribunal has residual jurisdiction to grant the “</span><span lang=EN-CA>several
    specialized sanctions for violations of [the <i>Student Code</i>], including
    educative requirements, removal from residence, campus restrictions, suspension
    and expulsion.” She argues that these remedies are beyond the authority of an
    arbitrator. For example, the Tribunal’s no-contact direction, designed to
    protect Sarah Millington from further contact with Gizem </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Çakmak</span><span lang=EN-CA> , is a remedy the appellant claims
    “only the Tribunal possesses.” The appellant’s assertion is that removing
    jurisdiction from the Tribunal would “paralyze York’s system of regulation
    during times of labour strife, leaving student-employees immune from effective
    University regulation.” Accordingly, she argues that the Tribunal’s authority</span><span
lang=EN-CA> must be preserved to ensure that the complainants she represents
    are not deprived of appropriate remedies. This claim is attenuated by the fact
    that the actual suspensions and no-contact orders imposed by the Tribunal did
    not engage the “special remedies” and are not unusual in labour discipline.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the jurisprudence supports</span><span
lang=EN-CA> her position. She builds on <i>Morin</i> by referring to a number
    of other cases for the proposition that there are exceptions to the exclusive jurisdiction
    of labour arbitrators: <i>Naraine</i>; </span><i>Calgary Health Region v.
    Alberta (Human Rights &amp; Citizenship Commission)</i>, 2007 ABCA 120, 404
    A.R. 201, leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 280; <i>Halifax
    (Regional Municipality) v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission)</i>, 2008 NSCA
    21, 264 N.S.R. (2d) 61, leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 245<span
lang=EN-CA>. I accept this proposition. The question is whether it applies in
    this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the authorities the appellant relies on do not support her arguments,
    but rather undermine them. They address the interplay between a human rights
    tribunal and another statutory tribunal. Human rights legislation has a
    quasi-constitutional status and prevails over inconsistent legislation in the
    absence of express, unequivocal legislative language: <i>Naraine</i>, at para.
    47. The <i><span lang=EN-CA>York University Act</span></i><span lang=EN-CA> and
    the Tribunal created under it do not enjoy that status.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also relies on <i>Nova Scotia (Securities
    Commission) v. Schriver</i>, 2006 NSCA 1, 239 N.S.R. (2d) 306<span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>, in which</span> the jurisdictional contest was
    between the Nova Scotia Securities Commission and the Mutual Fund Dealers
    Association. Cromwell J.A. (as he then was) concluded that the Association did
    not have exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether Mr. Schriver breached its
    rules: at para. 45. He noted that the essential character of the dispute was<span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> “whether Mr. Schriver breached s. 30(3) of
    the [<i>Securities Act</i>, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 418]”: at para. 34. He found that
    “the essential character of the dispute lies at the core of the Commission’s
    statutory mandate”: at para. 34. This decision gives no comfort to the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also relies on a police discipline
    case,<i> Regina Police Assn. Inc. v. Regina (City) Board of Police
    Commissioners</i>, 2000 SCC 14, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 360. In that case, Article 8 of
    the collective agreement specifically excluded disputes arising under <i>The
    Police Act, 1990</i>, S.S. 1990-91, c. P-15.01 and <i>The Municipal Discipline
    Regulations, 1991</i>, R.R.S., c. P-15.01, Reg. 4 from grievance arbitration. <i>Regina
    Police</i> offers support for the respondents’ position, because,</span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not find the appellant’s arguments to be persuasive. The
    Tribunal is not a creature of legislation like a human rights tribunal, a
    securities commission, a police services board, or a labour arbitrator
    appointed under a collective agreement governed by the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>.
    The Tribunal was established under the <i>Student Code</i>, which does not
    amount to a regulation under s. 17 of the <i>Legislation Act, 2006</i>, S.O.
    2006, c. 21, Sched. F, and could be easily changed by York’s president at any
    time. The Tribunal was not established by statute.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, while not dispositive, the appellant’s arguments do establish
    that the choice among the models of <span lang=EN-CA>overlapping, concurrent,
    or exclusive jurisdiction is a live issue in this case, as it was in <i>Weber</i> and <i>Morin</i>. I return to the appellant’s arguments below after considering
    the rest of the legislative tableau and completing the <i>Morin </i>steps.</span></p>

    to Class Act</i>, which the Legislative Assembly of Ontario  enacted to end the

    “all matters remaining in dispute between [the employer and the bargaining
    agent] with respect to the terms and conditions of employment of the employees
    in that unit” to a mediator-arbitrator in what is called interest arbitration. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>17(3) The mediator-arbitrator <u>shall not

    lock-out in respect of the employee’s bargaining unit became lawful and ends on
    the date on which a new collective agreement is executed by the parties or

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>The grievance arbitration provisions
    in the collective agreements referred to in s.17(4) of the <i>Back to Class Act </i>connect to s. 48 and other provisions of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>,

    torts, arising in the context of a collective agreement (emphasis omitted): at
    para. 45. This statement flowed from the language of what is now s. 48 of the <i>Labour

lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I make several observations about the
    intersection of these three statutes. First, the Legislature was well aware
    that that the members of the two bargaining units ordered back to work were
    both students and employees. This was adverted to in Hansard during the
    Minister’s remarks at second reading of the legislation and it is reflected in
    the text of the legislation itself, where the members of the units are expressly
    described as “graduate students” as well as employees: Bill 2, <i>An Act
    respecting Hydro One Limited, the termination of the White Pines Wind Project
    and the labour disputes between York University and Canadian Union of Public
    Employees, Local 3903</i>, 2nd reading, Ontario, Legislative Assembly,<i> Official Report of Debates (Hansard)</i>, 1st Sess., 42nd Leg., No. 6 (19 July
    2018) at p. 188 (Hon. Greg Rickford); <i>Back to Class Act</i>, s. 1(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the Legislature was familiar with the fractious
    situation at York, as Mr. Kaplan finely detailed in his Report that led to the
    enactment of the legislation: see generally </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Report
    In the Matter of an Industrial Inquiry Commission Pursuant to Section 37 of the
    Labour Relations Act, 1995 and In the Matter of the Negotiation of New

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the form of the legislation was uniquely attuned
    to that situation. Typical back-to-work legislation does not contain the
    underlined language set out in ss. 17(3) and 17(4) of the <i>Back to Class Act</i>,
    which I repeat here for convenience:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><span lang=EN-CA>Restriction – discipline
    and discharge</span></b></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>17(3) The mediator-arbitrator <u>shall not

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Contrast, for example, the <i>York University
    Labour Disputes Resolution Act, 2009</i>, S.O. 2009, c. 1, which was enacted in
    response to the Union’s strike in 2009. There was no similar provision related
    to discipline and arbitration contained in this Act. Section 12(1) gave the
    mediator-arbitrator “</span><span lang=EN-CA>exclusive jurisdiction to
    determine all matters that he or she considers necessary to conclude a new
    collective agreement,” without a similar reference to discipline and grievance
    arbitration now found in the </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Back to Class Act</span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>.<i> </i>The 2009 language was more typical of other back-to-work
    legislation in the education sector: see, for example, the following now
    repealed or spent legislation, including <i>Back to School Act (Toronto and
    Windsor), 2001</i>, S.O. 2001, c. 1; <i>Back to School Act (Simcoe Muskoka

    and 17(4) was not present in the original version of the <i>Back to Class Act</i>,
    which</span><span lang=EN-CA> was given first reading on May&nbsp;7, 2018 and
    was similar in form to the 2009 legislation: Bill 70, <i>An Act to resolve

lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the underlined language in ss. 17(3)
    and 17(4) of the <i>Back to Class Act </i>must be given a purposive
    interpretation in the context of its genesis. The unique language was
    deliberately inserted in the final version of the <i>Back to Class Act</i>,
    which was brought forward as part of Bill 2 and introduced for first reading on
    July 16, 2018: Bill 2, <i>An Act respecting Hydro One Limited, the termination

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I draw three inferences from the genesis of the<i> Back to Class Act</i>. First, the Legislature intended York to be free to
    discipline Union members for their activities during the strike period without
    the risk that such discipline would be undone in the mediation-arbitration.
    Second, the Legislature intended the legislation to be comprehensive, using the
    words “<u>any activity</u> that took place” during the period of the strike
    (emphasis added): <i>Back to Class Act</i>, s. 17(3). Third, the Legislature
    required any contested discipline to be resolved under grievance arbitration. I
    explain these inferences in more detail below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By using broad language, the Legislature stated its
    intention that the matters of discharge and discipline “in respect of <u>any
    activity</u>” were to be reserved to the parties and any disputes to be
    resolved ultimately by grievance arbitration (emphasis added): <i>Back to Class
    Act</i>, ss. 17(3), 17(4). This text removed authority, which would otherwise
    have existed, from the mediator-arbitrator to impose a collective agreement
    that would resolve differences over “discharge or discipline in respect of
    activities that took place,” during the strike period: <i>Back to Class Act</i>,
    s. 17(4). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This wording gave York two advantages. First,
    York was left free to impose discharge or discipline in respect of any activities
    that took place during the strike without its authority being nullified by an
    “all-in” mediator-arbitrator’s decision that could wipe the discipline slate
    clean. Second, the language put the burden on grievance arbitration by taking
    away from the Union the ability to attack the discipline as an unfair labour
    practice under s. 96 of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>. This course of action
    would prevent a protracted and expensive public hearing before the Ontario Labour
    Relations Board.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This structure was not accidental. Debate at
    second reading pointed to the difference between the new legislation and the original
    version of the legislation: “[T]he addition of the ‘discipline and discharge’
    clause … prohibits the arbitrator from including language in the new agreement
    to prevent disciplinary action against workers for conduct during the strike”: <i>Official
    Report of Debates (Hansard)</i>, (19 July 2018) at p. 200. It was also pointed
    out that the new language “removes the ability of employees to argue that
    reprisal that is taken against them is an unfair labour practice” and requires
    employees to “go through the normal grievance procedure if there is discipline
    implemented against them”: at p. 200. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the other hand, the Union members also
    benefited from the same broad language. York was not free of any constraint in
    “discharging or disciplining an employee for just cause”: <i>Back to Class Act</i>,
    s. 17(3). A fair reading of ss. 17(3) and 17(4) together confirms that “<u>[a]</u></span><u><span
lang=EN-CA>ny dispute</span></u><span lang=EN-CA> between the parties”
    regarding the discipline of a Union member “in respect of activities that took
    place during [the strike period] <u>shall be determined</u> through the
    grievance procedure”</span><span lang=EN-CA> by a labour arbitrator (emphasis
    added): <i>Back to Class Act</i>, s. 17(4).</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To conclude on the first <i>Morin</i> step
    regarding the legislative mandate, s.&nbsp;17(4) of the <i>Back to Class Act </i>is
    the operative provision to understand the scope of an arbitrator’s jurisdiction.
    In my view, the language chosen was deliberately and uniquely comprehensive in
    labour law terms, as I have explained. It provides, to repeat for convenience:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>17(4) <u>Any dispute between the parties</u> concerning discharge<u> or discipline in respect of [any] activities that took

    the language of s. 17(3), with which s. 17(4) must be read. I see this as the

lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The question in the second <i>Morin </i>step is
    “whether the legislative mandate applies to the particular dispute at issue”:
    at para. 15. The focus is on the particular dispute and on which tribunal is

    this case <i>ad hoc</i>, time-limited, strike-ending legislation.</span></p>

    of the dispute – involving employment benefits – and the ambit of the

lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, I acknowledge that York’s ability to
    discipline the respondents for their activities during the strike could
    plausibly be rooted in both the <i>Student Code</i> and in the collective
    agreement. It was theoretically open to York to proceed under the <i>Student
    Code</i>, under the collective agreement, or under both. It chose the <i>Student
    Code</i> as its preferred venue in the face of the Union’s dogged opposition. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, York could have responded to each act of
    misconduct immediately, but nothing was done until after the strike. Why?
    Perhaps York had in mind s. 80.1 of the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, which
    prevents the imposition of discipline during a strike. Perhaps York considered
    that initiating student discipline would be unduly provocative during the
    strike. Regardless, it seems obvious that strike considerations played a role
    in the timing of the complaints.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Fourth, in its earlier January 11, 2019 decision, the Tribunal noted
    that the complaints were submitted “within 30 days following the end of the
    disruption of University activities (July 25, 2018)” and that the complaints
    “cover several incidents that occurred during the labour disruption of 2018.” The
    Tribunal held that the end of the strike period was the date from which it would
    assess the timeliness of the complaints.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Fifth, the complaints were launched by Ms. McAulay, who is a senior
    administrator. I see her, in the overall factual context, as a proxy for York,
    and all of her arguments were aimed at vindicating York’s position.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>These facts are all demonstrably linked to the strike, to the<i> Back
    to Class Act</i>, and to the collective agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The second <i>Morin</i> step also considers which tribunal is the
    better fit for resolving the particular dispute. In my view, this consideration
    favours labour arbitration in this case, for three reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, labour arbitrators routinely consider the appropriateness of
    discipline for the activities of employees during a strike. They are presumed
    to have expertise in the assessment of the conduct of Union members and whether
    that conduct fits within the acceptable parameters of primary and secondary
    picketing. There are examples of several labour cases in which terminations and
    suspensions have been upheld, others in which reinstatement has occurred, or
    the period of suspension has been reduced. The nuances are intensely factual
    and fall squarely within the expertise of a labour arbitrator: I note that the
    sanctions imposed by the Tribunal – suspensions and no-contact directions – are
    not different in kind from what labour arbitrators often see: Carolyn Hart,
    “Focus 14 – Discipline of Managers for Harassing Employees” in Adam Beatty,
    David M. Beatty &amp; Donald J.M. Brown, <i>Canadian Labour Arbitration</i>,
    5th ed. (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 2019).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, labour arbitration is governed by the collective agreement,
    the <i>Labour Relations Act</i>, arbitral and judicial case law, and arbitral
    practice. An arbitrator must provide procedural fairness to the parties. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Third, of particular importance is the impartiality and the
    appearance of impartiality of the decision-maker. A labour arbitrator is not
    connected in interest to the disputants, unlike the Tribunal in this case, and
    is better fitted to resolve disputes over strike-related discipline. </span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Conclusion on Issue Two Regarding the Tribunal’s
    Jurisdiction</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This court is obliged to respect the intention and the instructions
    of the legislature as set out in the relevant legislation, as <i>Vavilov</i>, <i>Weber</i>,
    and <i>Morin</i> instruct. The legislative mandate identified in the analysis
    at the first <i>Morin</i> step is in the broad and unique language set out in
    s. 17(4) of the <i>Back to Class Act</i>, which requires “Any dispute between
    the parties concerning … discipline in respect of [any] activities that took
    place” during the strike period to be subject to grievance arbitration. The student
    discipline initiated by the appellant is, in my view, a dispute concerning
    discipline in respect of activities during the strike period, to paraphrase s.
    17(4). Any dispute about discipline must be resolved by way of grievance under
    the collective agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The conclusions drawn at the second <i>Morin </i>step reinforce this
    interpretation: this dispute is deeply rooted in the labour conflict and in the
    collective agreement. A labour arbitrator is better fitted to resolve it. The
    legislative language is clear and comprehensive: a labour arbitrator has
    exclusive jurisdiction over disputes connected to discipline for strike-related
    activities. This interpretation is supported by the principles of statutory
    interpretation, which discourage parallel proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant has the strong conviction that York must have primacy
    over student misconduct and that it must have the last word, not a labour
    arbitrator. But that does not give effect to the legislative intent driving the
    enactment of the <i>Back to Class Act. </i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The legislation was carefully designed to minimize the intrusion
    into York’s self-governance. Section 17 of the <i>Back to Class Act </i>is a
    situation-specific, short-acting limitation on York’s autonomy. The appellant
    argues that giving a labour arbitrator the last word improperly gives “primacy
    to the employer-employee relationship over the student-University [relationship].”
    However, that, in the particular circumstances, is precisely what the Legislature
    intended to do.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is no sense in which the legislation, specific and
    time-limited, causes York more generally to “</span><span lang=EN-CA>lose
    jurisdiction over its students each time they act in an employee context.” Nor
    has the legislation “eviscerated York’s ability to meet obligations it has to
    other community members.” And it was, and perhaps still is, quite open to York
    to discipline the respondents under the collective agreement. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>York could have imposed precisely the sanctions set by the Tribunal
    on the respondents under the collective agreement. The respondents could have
    grieved the discipline, and the task of the arbitrator would then have been to
    determine whether the sanctions were warranted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not agree with the appellant’s argument that ss. 17(3) and
    17(4) of the</span><span lang=EN-CA> <i>Back to Class Act </i>must be
    interpreted to apply only to the respondents as employees, and not to them as
    students. The implied limitation would defeat the Legislature’s manifest
    intention, in this high conflict case, to create a single, exclusive process
    for resolving disputes about the discipline of the respondents for strike-related
    activities.</span><span lang=EN-CA> The legislation was a surgical intervention
    designed to restore peace. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The court’s caution in <i>Weber</i> and in <i>Naraine</i> against
    parallel proceedings applies here, especially given the unusual and unique
    language of </span><span lang=EN-CA>the <i>Back to Class Act. </i>There is no
    basis for the appellant’s argument that there is overlapping or residual
    jurisdiction with respect to the respondents’ activities during the strike.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Finally, it is trite law that when a more general provision – the <i>York
    University Act</i> – </span><span class=ssbf><span lang=EN-CA>conflicts with a
    provision that “deals specifically with the matter in question” – the <i>Back
    to Class Act</i> – the court may resolve the conflict through “applying the
    specific provision to the exclusion of the more general one. The specific
    prevails over the general; it does not matter which was enacted first”: </span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Divisional Court was accordingly correct in its conclusion that
    the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to discipline the respondents for their
    participation in the activities that underpinned the complaints.</span></p>
  <h1 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-CA>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Issue Three: Should judicial review have been
    denied because an appeal to the Appeal PANEL was an adequate alternative
    remedy?</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Divisional Court found that there were exceptional circumstances
    justifying its decision to decide the jurisdictional issue despite the respondents’
    failure to pursue an appeal to the Appeal Panel. First, York’s change in
    position about whether it was too late to appeal to the Appeal Panel cast doubt
    on the adequacy of this remedy: at para. 67. Second, there was no risk of
    fragmentation because the Tribunal and the Appeal Panel had already finally
    determined the merits of the complaints and imposed sanctions: at para. 68.
    Third, there was no utility in requiring the respondents to appeal to the Appeal
    Panel before continuing with the judicial review because there was only one
    outcome: The Legislature had conferred jurisdiction on a labour arbitrator to
    adjudicate discipline disputes: at para. 69. Fourth, there was evidence of
    hardship – for example, one of the applicants risked deportation if suspended:
    at para. 70. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='background:white'>The appellant argues that the Divisional
    Court erred in not applying the <i>Strickland </i>factors for assessing whether
    an appeal from the Tribunal to the Appeal Panel was an adequate alternative
    remedy to judicial review: <i>Strickland v. Canada (Attorney-General)</i>, 2015
    SCC 37, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 713. In <i>Strickland</i>,<i> </i>the court considered
    when a court should exercise its discretion to decline judicial review on the
    basis that there was an adequate alternative remedy. The court set out a non-exhaustive
    list of factors to make this determination, at para. 42: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The convenience of the alternative remedy; the
    nature of the error alleged; the nature of the other forum which could deal
    with the issue, including its remedial capacity; the existence of adequate and effective
    recourse in the forum in which litigation is already taking place;
    expeditiousness; the relative expertise of the alternative decision-maker;
    economical use of judicial resources; and cost. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='background:white'>As the Supreme Court instructed in <i>Strickland</i>,
    it is not enough for the court to consider only whether there is an adequate
    alternative; it should also consider the suitability and appropriateness of
    judicial review in the circumstances: at para.&nbsp;43. This balancing exercise
    requires the court to account for the purposes and policy considerations
    underpinning the legislative scheme at issue: at para.&nbsp;44. The Divisional
    Court decided, in its discretion, that it was not appropriate to remit the matter
    back to the Appeal Panel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='background:white'>I would reject the appellant’s argument
    that the Divisional Court erred by not considering the <i>Strickland</i> factors. While the court did not cite <i>Strickland</i>, it did refer to the
    leading case on the adequate alternative doctrine – </span><i><span lang=EN-CA>Harelkin
    v. University of Regina</span></i><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:"91imxtphhkbiywx",serif'>, </span><span lang=EN-CA>[1979] 2 S.C.R. 561</span><span lang=EN-CA
style='background:white'>:</span><span lang=EN-CA style='background:white'> at
    para. 63; <i>Strickland</i>, at para. 40. In my view, the factors the
    Divisional Court considered adequately map onto the <i>Strickland</i> factors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='background:white'>First, the court noted that it was not
    clear the appeal process was an adequate alternative remedy because it was
    uncertain whether the Appeal Panel would grant a time extension: at para. 67.
    This concern maps onto the <i>Strickland </i>factors: convenience of the
    alternative remedy and whether adequate and effective recourse was available in
    the forum in which litigation was already taking place.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='background:white'>Second, the Tribunal and the Appeal Panel
    had determined the merits and sanctions appeals, and so there was no risk of
    fragmenting the proceedings: at para. 68. Because all the evidence was in, it
    was more expeditious to proceed with judicial review than to send the matter
    back to the Appeal Panel and risk another round of judicial review. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='background:white'>Third, the court pointed to the clear
    legislative wording that required an arbitrator to adjudicate this type of
    dispute: at para. 69. It seems obvious that the interpretation of the
    legislation is a legal question that neither the Tribunal nor the Appeal Panel
    was better qualified to undertake than the Divisional Court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='background:white'>Fourth, the court pointed to hardship,
    prejudice, costs or delay as being factors that may constitute exceptional
    circumstances for the judicial review application to proceed: at para. 70.
    These considerations map onto the <i>Strickland </i>factors: expeditiousness,
    economical use of judicial resources, and cost. </span></p>
