  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Juriansz J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1 style='page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction AND OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal is from a motion for summary
    judgment in an action brought under Rule 76 of the <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, awarding Ms. Manthadi, the respondent, damages for
    wrongful dismissal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi was initially employed on February
    7, 1981 by one of the third parties to this action, 63732 Ontario Limited (“637”).
    On or about November 2, 2017, the appellant purchased the assets of 637 along
    with the business name “ASCO”. Ms. Manthadi worked for ASCO for approximately
    one month when she was placed on layoff on December 13, 2017 and never
    recalled. She sued ASCO for wrongful dismissal and ASCO brought a third party
    claim against 637. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge granted Ms. Manthadi’s motion
    for summary judgment. She held that Ms. Manthadi “had been continually employed
    from 1981 to 2017, a period of 36 years”, concluded that the proper notice
    period was 20 months, and awarded Ms. Manthadi $66,391.40 for damages for
    wrongful dismissal plus $11,958.96 for costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, ASCO argues that the motion judge erred
    by holding that:</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Summary judgment was appropriate when there were
    material facts in dispute and an outstanding third party claim;</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi’s employment with ASCO was a
    continuation of her employment with 637 for the purposes of calculating her
    entitlement to reasonable notice on termination; </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The proper notice period was 20 months; and </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The damages should not be reduced by the amount
    paid to Ms. Manthadi by 637 under a settlement and release agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties agreed this appeal could proceed in
    writing. However, the court invited them to make oral submissions in response
    to certain questions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I agree with ASCO
    that summary judgment was not appropriate in this case. The motion judge
    concluded summary judgment was appropriate primarily because she proceeded on
    an incorrect understanding of the common law that governs an employee’s rights
    to reasonable notice from the purchaser of an ongoing business. This appeal
    presents the opportunity to review and restate the applicable law of Ontario. I
    would set aside the order below and remit the matter for trial.</span></p>
  <h1 style='page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Facts </span></h1>
  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi is terminated by 637</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi worked for 637 – then known as ASCO
    Manufacturing Limited – as a braze welder from February 7, 1981 until early November
    2017 when the appellant purchased 637’s assets and business name. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Agreement of Purchase and Sale was dated
    November 1, 2017 and was said to take effect on November 3, 2017. In that
    agreement, the appellant obtained a warranty from 637 stating, among other
    things, that 637 had provided notice of termination and paid severance to all
    its employees. 637 also agreed to indemnify the appellant against all claims arising
    from a breach of its warranties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi’s evidence is that 637 presented
    her with a Settlement and Release Agreement dated September 28, 2017 on or
    about that date. She states that 637 advised her the business was being sold
    and she would be offered continued employment with the appellant. In the Settlement
    and Release Agreement, Ms. Manthadi acknowledges receiving written notice her
    employment would terminate on November 24, 2017 and that she would be paid $5,900
    “representing 8 weeks gross compensation in full satisfaction of all claims …
    including all severance pay, termination pay or other compensation howsoever
    arising”. She released 637 (referred to as Asco in the Settlement and Release
    Agreement) from all liability “in connection with the Employee’s employment
    with [637], including without limitation the cessation of such employment.” In
    my view, nothing turns on a second version of the agreement that ASCO filed as
    fresh evidence in this court on consent showing different execution and
    termination dates.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is common ground that Ms. Manthadi received
    the payment pursuant to the Settlement and Release Agreement, but there is no
    evidence as to when she did. </span></p>
  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi is hired by ASCO</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi was one of twenty of 637’s
    employees who were employed by ASCO. The terms of her employment by ASCO and
    the capacity in which she was employed by ASCO are disputed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>ASCO’s position is that it hired Ms. Manthadi along
    with nineteen other 637 employees for general labour work to pack and unpack
    the purchased assets for the move to ASCO’s place of business. ASCO also says
    it “did not assume the continuity of [637’s] employees” or “recognize [637’s]
    employees’ prior years of service rendered with [637].”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi says she was offered and accepted
    employment by ASCO on an indefinite basis. She states she understood that ASCO
    would recognize her years of service with 637 and that she continued to work as
    a welder without interruption. However, she agreed that she assisted ASCO with
    moving the purchased assets to a new location from December 4, 2017 onward
    until she was laid off.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the affidavits of ASCO’s manager and Ms.
    Manthadi state their respective positions, neither alleges any specific
    communication between them to support those positions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There </span><span lang=EN-CA>was no written
    agreement governing Ms. Manthadi’s employment. Ms. Manthadi was not required to
    apply or attend an interview before she was hired. Ms. Manthadi continued to
    work similar hours at a similar rate of pay until December 13, 2017, when ASCO
    laid her off citing “shortage of work” with an unknown date of recall. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi produced text messages from her
    supervisor in December advising she was not being recalled but that he would
    let her know when she was being recalled. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Manthadi brought an action against ASCO
    alleging wrongful dismissal after she was never recalled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>ASCO in turn brought a third party claim against
    637 and its officers. ASCO pled that 637</span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'> </span><span lang=EN-CA>breached its obligations
    under the Agreement of Purchase and Sale by falsely representing that it had
    terminated Ms. Manthadi and paid her the applicable employment benefits. ASCO
    also relied on the indemnity provisions of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence to the third party claim pled that 637
    entered into an agreement with Ms. Manthadi that gave Ms. Manthadi notice of
    termination and severance pay as required by the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.
    The defence also pled the parties entered into the agreement on September 28,
    2017, before the scheduled closing of the asset purchase on November 3, 2017. </span></p>
  <h1 style='page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the motion judge’s decision</span></h1>
  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Summary judgment was appropriate </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge observed that summary judgment
    remains appropriate in a simplified procedure action that is document-driven or
    where there is limited contested evidence. Summary judgment was appropriate in
    this case, she explained, because the “material facts on this motion have
    either been admitted or not refuted by [ASCO].” She said that any matters in
    conflict were not material and would not impact on her decision. She found it unnecessary
    to resolve the disputes about whether Ms. Manthadi was hired as a temporary general
    labourer to move the purchased equipment or on an indefinite basis as a welder,
    and whether there was an express understanding of how her service with 637
    would be treated by ASCO.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge also determined that ASCO’s
    outstanding third party claim against 637 did not make Ms. Manthadi’s motion
    for summary judgment inappropriate. Noting that 637 did not participate in the
    motion, she inferred that 637 did not consider the outcome of the motion
    relevant to the third party claim. She also found the dealings between 637 and Ms.
    Manthadi to be irrelevant to determining the issues between ASCO and Ms.
    Manthadi. </span></p>

    determining the notice to which Ms. Manthadi was entitled, she was “<u>required</u> to consider her past years of employment with 637, commencing in 1981” (emphasis
    added). Thus, she held that Ms. Manthadi should be considered to have been
    continuously employed by ASCO from 1981 for the purposes of calculating her
    entitlement to reasonable notice under the common law. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge arrived at this conclusion by
    reasoning that the common law approach to assessing a successor employer’s
    obligation to provide reasonable notice mirrored the statutory dictates of the <em>Employment
    Standards Act, 2000</em><i>, </i>S.O. 2000, c. 41<i>.</i> She set out the terms
    of s. 9(1) of the ESA, noting there were only two preconditions to its
    application: (1) that an employer sells his business to a purchaser; and (2)
    that the purchaser employs an employee of the employer. She remarked that “for
    the purpose of the ESA and the calculation of [Ms. Manthadi’s] notice period thereunder,
    [Ms. Manthadi] is considered to have been continually employed by [ASCO] since
    1981.” In these reasons, I will refer to a purchaser of a business who employs
    an employee of the vendor as the “successor employer”, and to the vendor as the
    “predecessor employer”.</span></p>

    ESA to the facts of this case, as the appellant contends. However, she stated
    that “[t]he law also supports this concept of continuous employment for the
    purposes of common law entitlement to damages for wrongful dismissal”. Because Ms.
    Manthadi’s previous employer sold its assets and business and the purchaser
    employed Ms. Manthadi, the motion judge reasoned that she was “required” to
    consider Ms. Manthadi to have been employed by ASCO since 1981 for the purposes
    of determining her entitlement to common law notice. </span></p>

    deducted from the damage award to avoid “double dipping”. She stated that the
    purpose of damages in a wrongful dismissal action is to compensate the employee
    for the notice they should have received on the day of their termination. She
    concluded that “any monies [Ms. Manthadi] may have received previously from 637

    J. in <em>Commander Construction v. Sovereign General Insurance Co</em>., 2012
    ONSC 1075, for the observation that a motion for summary judgment in a
    simplified procedure action is appropriate where the case is document-driven or
    there is limited contested evidence. Almost the whole of Mulligan J.’s reasons are
    devoted to explaining the need for circumspection in entertaining a summary
    judgment motion in a simplified procedure action, based on this court’s
    decision in <em>Combined Air Mechanical Services Inc. v. Flesch</em><i>, </i>2011
    ONCA 764, 108 O.R. (3d) 1, rev’d on other grounds, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R.
    87. As a result, Mulligan J. concluded that summary judgment was inappropriate
    in the case before him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Combined Air</em>, a five-judge panel of
    this court indicated, while a motion for summary judgment could be appropriate
    in some Rule 76 proceedings, such cases would be exceptional: at paras. 254,
    256; see also <em>Singh v. Concept Plastics Limited,</em> 2016 ONCA 815, 2017
    C.L.L.C. 210-011, at para. 23. This was for two reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, it will often be more efficient to simply
    proceed to a summary trial as contemplated by the <i>Rules</i>: <i>Combined
    Air, </i>at para. 254. The court observed that the simplified procedure rules are
    designed to get the parties to trial with a minimum of delay and costs. One of
    the key objectives of the simplified procedure rules is to limit the extent of
    pretrial proceedings. Discovery is restricted and cross-examination on
    affidavits and examinations of witnesses on motions are not allowed. The
    summary trial procedure is designed to reduce the length of the trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court directed that a judge faced with a
    contested motion for summary judgment in a simplified procedure action will
    “need to assess whether entertaining the motion is consistent with the
    efficiency rationale reflected in the simplified procedures”: <em>Combined Air</em>,
    at para. 255. </span></p>

    summary judgment decision in <em>Hryniak v. Mauldin</em>,<i> </i>2014 SCC 7,
    [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87,<i> </i>did not specifically address how summary judgment
    applies in a simplified procedure case. However, the court did affirm that the
    motion judge must assess, among other things, “the relative efficiencies of
    proceeding by way of summary judgment, as opposed to trial” and the impact of
    summary judgment on the litigation as a whole when determining whether it is in
    the interests of justice to exercise their fact-finding powers and grant
    summary judgment: <em>Hryniak</em><i>, </i>at paras. 58, 60. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the simplified procedure rules, which
    are designed to allow the matter to be determined in an expedited fashion, also
    constrain the parties’ ability to marshal evidence on a summary judgment motion
    and meet their obligation to put their best foot forward. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, ASCO submits it was hampered
    because it could not cross-examine Ms. Manthadi on her affidavit supporting the
    motion and did not have the evidence of the third party, 637. Ms. Manthadi responds
    that ASCO could have examined Ms. Manthadi and the third parties for discovery
    (though the parties had initially agreed to proceed without discoveries). These
    submissions illustrate that summary judgment motions should be discouraged
    where they would simply require the parties to prepare for and deal with
    additional procedures, expending resources and time that would have enabled
    them to proceed to a summary trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As this court observed in <em>Combined Air</em><i>,</i> at para. 4, “the inappropriate use of Rule 20 has the perverse effect of
    creating delays and wasting costs associated with preparing for, arguing and deciding
    a motion for summary judgment, only to see the matter sent on for trial.” The
    risk of this perverse consequence is greater in simplified procedure cases.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge in this case did find that the
    motion for summary judgment was “the most proportionate, most expeditious, and
    least expensive method of adjudication of the issues”. But apart from
    expressing that conclusion, the bulk of her analysis is directed to her ability
    to decide the issues. She held that she was able to decide the issues because
    she took the view that the matters in dispute were not material. However, in the
    next section, I explain how factual disputes that the motion judge could not
    and did not resolve on the record before her were genuine issues requiring a
    trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I conclude the motion judge erred in holding that
    summary judgment was appropriate in the circumstances. This was a case in which
    the parties had agreed to proceed without any discoveries but where
    cross-examination on the general assertions in both parties’ affidavits was
    necessary to resolve the competing evidence. Allowing the matter to proceed to
    a summary trial would have ensured a fair and just determination on the merits
    while also disposing of the third party claim.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the common law implies a term in contracts

lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the motion judge did not resolve
    the dispute about the basis on which ASCO hired Ms. Manthadi. ASCO’s argument
    that it hired Ms. Manthadi on a temporary basis for the specific task of moving
    the equipment amounted to a claim she was a fixed term employee, which, if
    accepted at trial, could support finding she was not entitled to notice of

lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge proceeded on the view that the
    common law supported the same “concept of continuous employment” as did s. 9(1)
    of the ESA. This explains why she found it unnecessary to resolve the disputes between
    the parties. The fact that Ms. Manthadi, an employee of the vendor of a
    business, was employed by the purchaser of the business was sufficient to
    establish she was continuously employed and entitled to reasonable notice from
    ASCO. The motion judge reasoned she had all the facts necessary to find the
    notice period. Ms. Manthadi’s length of service was 36 years, and there was no
    dispute about the dates of her employment, hours worked, rate of pay and age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> However, a sharp distinction must be drawn
    between termination of employment by a successor employer under the ESA and
    under the common law. While the ESA is clear that the employment of employees
    of the vendor of a business who are employed by the purchaser is deemed not to
    be terminated for the purposes of the ESA, the common law is equally clear that
    such employees are terminated (by constructive dismissal) when their employer
    sells the business and there is a change in the identity of the employer. Dubin
    J.A. stated the common law in <em>Addison v. M. Loeb Ltd</em><i>. </i>(1986),
    25 D.L.R. (4th) 151 (Ont. C.A.), at pp.<i> </i>152-53,<i> </i>as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>At common law, since a contract of personal

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ordinarily, long-time employees who are
    terminated without reasonable notice can expect a substantial payment of damages
    in lieu of notice. Terminated employees, however, have a duty to mitigate their
    damages. In <em>Addison</em><i>, </i>Dubin J.A. adopted the description of the
    employees’ plight by M. Norman Grosman in “Employee Continuous Service Rights:
    Here Today, Gone Tomorrow - <em>Addison v. M. Loeb Ltd.</em>&quot; (1985) 5:4
    Adv. Q. 500, at p. 502, who observed that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Once the employee accepts employment with the
    new employer, thereby establishing a new contract, he will probably
    &quot;mitigate himself right out of his cause of action&quot; against his
    former employer. If he fails to accept the new job and it is in all respects
    fundamentally the same as his old one, he is likely precluded by the doctrine
    of mitigation from recovering any loss sustained on the constructive
    termination on the basis that such loss could reasonably have been avoided. The
    unfortunate employee is caught in a bind and will inevitably suffer at least
    the loss of his perhaps lengthy service with the former employer. If, on the
    other hand, the new employer declines to employ the individual, the termination
    becomes express rather than constructive and the former employer will remain
    liable for any properly recoverable damage sustained by the employee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, long-term employees, who are employed by
    the purchaser of their employer’s business, have little prospect of obtaining
    damages for the termination of their employment. Damages aside, people need
    jobs. Employees terminated by the sale of a business often have no realistic
    option other than to accept the offer of a new contract of employment with the
    purchaser if such is offered. If they are subsequently terminated by the
    purchaser, the new start date of their term of service weighs in favour of a shorter
    notice period than had the business not been sold. </span></p>

    of employment with the predecessor employer when determining the length of the notice
    period unless there is “an express understanding to the contrary”: at pp.
    155-56. It does so by attaching appropriate weight to the employee’s “experience”,
    one of the factors in the generally accepted formulation for the determination
    of reasonable notice: at p. 156. As stated by McRuer C.J.H.C. in <em>Bardal</em>,

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There can be no catalogue laid down as to what

    working at an IGA store in Delhi, Ontario in May 1963. In September 1981, a
    receiver operated the business for approximately two weeks and then sold the
    assets of the business to the defendant, who continued to operate the store.
    The employee continued to perform the same duties until April 1983 when his
    employment was terminated. The trial judge found the employee was wrongfully
    dismissed and assessed his damages on the basis that he had been employed for
    some 18 and a half months only. The trial judge awarded damages equivalent to
    six months’ notice of termination. The employee appealed.</span></p>

    assess the appellant’s damages for wrongful dismissal in the same manner as if
    he had walked into the store for the first time after the respondent purchased
    the business and became a new employee of the respondent”: at pp. 155-56. His
    examination of earlier cases disclosed “no clear principle other than that in
    the majority of the cases some recognition is given to the period of employment
    with the predecessor employer”: at p. 156. </span></p>

    service was not the only factor to be applied in determining the proper award
    for damages: at p. 156. The conduct of the parties was also relevant: at p. 156.
    Dubin J.A. observed that the purchaser, in hiring the employee, “automatically
    received the benefit of the services of a very experienced assistant manager
    and one fully familiar with the operation of the store”: at p. 156. Dubin
    J.A.’s observation of the value of experienced employees to the purchaser is
    apt. A purchaser of an ongoing business who takes on the vendor’s employees avoids
    the burden, cost, and time of having to recruit a new employment force that is unfamiliar
    with the work, the working environment, and one another. </span></p>

    (4th) 270 (Ont. C.A.), firmly rejected a so-called “rule of thumb” by which the
    starting point in determining reasonable notice would be to allow one month of
    notice for each year of service and then make adjustments for the particular
    circumstances of the case. Laskin J.A. held, at para. 73, that the rule of
    thumb approach “risks overemphasizing one of the <em>Bardal</em> factors, ‘length
    of service’, at the expense of the others” and that it gave “unnecessary
    prominence to length of service.” He concluded that “the rule of thumb approach
    is not warranted in principle, nor is it supported by authority”: at para. 73.

    its own, is simply redundant. Nor did Ms. Manthadi’s release of 637 from all
    claims in respect of her employment make the Settlement and Release Agreement
    relevant. The release clause applied only to 637. The motion judge was correct

    payment is part of those circumstances of the particular case the trial judge
    must consider. Both <em>Addison</em> and <em>Sorel</em> envisage a remedy that
    is fair to both parties. In my view, a payment, whatever its nature, received
    by an employee in respect of the termination of employment for which they are
    seeking “some recognition” from the successor employer is relevant in

    a valid agreement limiting her notice from 637 to her ESA entitlement, the fact
    that the amount of the payment was less than the notice a long-term employee
