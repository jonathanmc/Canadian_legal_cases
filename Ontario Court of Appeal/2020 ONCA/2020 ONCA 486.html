  <p class=Heard><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the order of Justice Lucy K. McSweeney
    of the Superior Court of Justice, dated February 19, 2020, with reasons
    reported at 2020 ONSC 1109.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Benotto J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is the mother of three children
    now ages 4, 7, and 11. Two years ago, she brought them from Kuwait to Canada
    without the respondent father’s consent. On arrival in Canada, she sought
    refugee status for herself and the children. She claims she fled an abusive
    relationship that put her safety and that of her children at risk of serious harm.
    The father denied the allegation and claimed that she wrongfully kidnapped the
    children.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The father applied for an order requiring that
    the children be returned to Kuwait. The mother asked Ontario to exercise jurisdiction
    to decide her custody claim. The basis for her claim was s. 23 of the <em>Children’s
    Law Reform Act</em>, R.S.O., 1990, c. C.12 (<em>CLRA</em>), which, despite
    other jurisdictional limits, permits an Ontario court to exercise its jurisdiction
    to make custody and access orders where the child is physically present in
    Ontario and the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the
    child(ren) would suffer serious harm if removed from Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge found that Ontario did not
    have jurisdiction under s. 23 because there was no risk of serious harm to the
    children. She ordered the children returned to Kuwait. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The mother appeals. She submits that the
    application judge erred in her determination of “serious harm” or, in the
    alternative, that the application should have been adjourned pending a
    determination of the refugee status. The mother’s appeal is supported by the Office
    of the Children’s Lawyer (OCL) and the four interveners: <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
    Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers (CARL), Amnesty International Canada,
    and Barbra Schlifer Commemorative Clinic.</span></em><em> </em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I conclude that the application judge erred in her
    treatment of the children’s evidence provided through the OCL. That evidence establishes
    a risk of serious harm. Ontario therefore has jurisdiction under s. 23 to make
    a custody and access order. I also conclude that it was an error to order the
    return of the children to Kuwait in the face of their asylum claim.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The mother and father are Jordanian citizens. They
    married in Kuwait on May 30, 2008, where they continued to live with their
    three children: a son I.A., born May 2009; a son A.A., born May 2013; and
    daughter H.A., born December 2015. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The family appeared to have a successful life in
    Kuwait. Both parents worked, the mother as a senior human resources executive
    and the father for various financial institutions and a car resale business.
    The boys attended the British School of Kuwait. The family socialized with
    extended family and friends and participated in community and extracurricular
    activities with the children. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 14, 2018, an incident occurred which
    led to the separation of the parties. The mother alleges that she was attacked
    by the father in front of the children. She says that this was part of a pattern
    of ongoing personal and sexual violence that she suffered and could no longer
    tolerate. The police were called and advised the parties not to bring charges.
    The father denies the allegations. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties separated and commenced court
    proceedings in the Hawally Family Court in Kuwait. The mother and children
    stayed in the family home and the father had access every Friday for twelve
    hours and on certain holidays. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two months later, on May 14, 2018, the mother
    left Kuwait with the children and sought refugee status in Canada. She did not
    seek the father’s consent, nor did she advise him in advance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 3, 2018, the father commenced an
    application in Ontario under the <em>CLRA</em>, seeking the return of the
    children to Kuwait. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The mother filed a cross-application
    requesting that the court assume jurisdiction for custody and access. She
    submitted that the children would suffer serious harm if returned to Kuwait. She
    said the father had been violent towards her and the children and they were
    afraid of him. She referred to a legal system in Kuwait that cannot protect her
    or the children in a meaningful way. An affidavit from a  legal expert on
    Sharia law and statutory law in Kuwait was filed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge appointed the OCL and
    requested a Voice of the Child Report for the oldest boy, I.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The child described his father
    as mean, angry, and threatening. He described being hit with a belt and
    threatened with a hot iron. He said that while in Kuwait, his mother would
    protect him from his father, that his father would threaten to hurt him and that
    when he did this, his mother would “get in his way” thereby protecting him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mary Polgar, a Clinical Investigator with the
    OCL, interviewed I. and his brother A. Both children told her that they saw
    their father grab their mother on March 14, 2018. When describing the event, A.
    grabbed and squeezed his own mouth. I. said he did not know if it was “choking
    or something else bad”. The children were also interviewed by Mahesh Prajapat of
    the OCL. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Vincent Murphy, a child psychologist,
    conducted an assessment of I. He concluded that I.’s logical-analytical and holistic
    problem-solving skills are at or slightly above the level of an average-age peer.
    Further, I. “was fairly consistent in what he had to say, both about fear of
    his father abusing him were he to return to Kuwait, and in his desire to stay
    in Canada”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The father strenuously denied all allegations of
    abuse. He tendered evidence from seven witnesses including the children’s nanny
    that he was not a violent person, that they never witnessed abuse, and that he
    was a loving father. The children’s doctor wrote a letter confirming that he
    had never seen any signs of abuse. The father claimed that the mother only
    returned to Canada to be with her family and that the allegations of abuse are
    a ruse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge had originally planned to
    await the outcome of the refugee proceedings. However, in February 2020 when that
    determination had not been made, she released her decision. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>DECISION OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The application judge addressed the requirements of s. 23 of the <em>CLRA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em> which authorizes the court to assume
    jurisdiction to make or to vary an order in respect of the custody of or access
    to a </span><span lang=EN>child if the court is satisfied that the child would,
    on the balance of probabilities, suffer serious harm if the child is removed
    from Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The application judge concluded that the mother had not established
    that the children would suffer serious harm. She d</span><span lang=EN-CA>id
    not accept the mother’s allegations of abuse. She found that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When
    cross-examined on her affidavits, [the mother’s] testimony was inconsistent,
    contradictory, and contradicted by other evidence, including other witnesses
    and her own documentary evidence. At times, she exaggerated her evidence. She
    omitted important details which did not serve her narrative. When challenged to
    provide detail, she was evasive and argumentative with counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s concerns included the
    fact that the mother had not mentioned the sexual violence before her testimony
    in court, nor did she mention the physical abuse of the children by the father.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge further considered the
    submission that the Kuwaiti courts would be biased against her and concluded
    that the expert evidence did not support her contention that she would not be
    fairly treated in Kuwait. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the evidence of I., the
    application judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…I find I cannot
    give much weight to his views because they have been influenced by his mother.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>She accepted I.’s maturity for the
    purpose of considering his views but concluded that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>He wishes to
    remain in Canada because he wants to stay with his mother, his asthma is better
    here, and Canada is a peaceful place to live. </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>Relying on <em>Andegiorgis v. Giorgis</em>,
    2018 ONCJ 965, she determined that these reasons were not “substantial” and
    that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>An overall
    preference for Canada is not a factor to ground an assumption of jurisdiction
    by this court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since the application judge was not satisfied
    that the children were at risk of serious harm, she concluded that Ontario did
    not have jurisdiction. She then proceeded under s. 40 of the <em>CLRA </em>to
    order the return of the children to Kuwait. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the children’s refugee claim she
    stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The existence of a
    refugee claim or an ongoing hearing before the Refugee Protection Division does
    not require the court on a removal application to stay its process until the

    to avoid concurrence of the refugee and <em>CLRA</em> proceedings in this

    the scheduled refugee hearing to conclude. The refugee hearing did not conclude

    erred in her credibility analysis of the mother in a number of ways including
    by employing unfounded myths about typical behaviour of a victim of sexual
    violence and by rejecting the expert evidence relating to family law in Kuwait.
    The error as to the credibility analysis then tainted the application judge’s consideration
    of the children’s evidence. In the result, she effectively gave no weight to
    the children’s evidence and failed to properly analyze the best interests of
    the children. Further, by ordering their return to Kuwait, she undermined their
    rights to have their refugee claim determined. The mother submits that the
    court has two options: adjourn the entire application until the children’s
    refugee status is determined; or consider the risk to the children and accept
    that Ontario has jurisdiction.</span></p>

    expert and social work evidence that the children face the risk of serious
    emotional, psychological, and physical harm if returned to Kuwait, and the
    expert assessment that their evidence was independent of the mother’s
    influence, the application judge was compelled to accept that evidence. The
    failure to do so is a reversible error. The OCL also submits that the entire
    matter – including the consideration of serious harm – should have been
    adjourned until the refugee status is determined. </span></p>

    findings as to credibility are entitled to deference and it was open to her to treat
    the children’s evidence as she did. There has been, he submits, a significant
    delay already during which time the father has been unable to be with his
    children. He submits that it would have been an error to adjourn the return
    order simply because the refugee claim has not yet been determined. (To date,
    the delay has been 27 months). The father requests that  application judge’s
    return order be respected. </span></p>

    2 S.C.R. 181, at paras. 82, 84, 86, 87 and 88 about the weight to be given to a

    assessing veracity, using clinical assessment tools, Dr. Murphy’s conclusions
    continue to support that I. is honest, makes his own judgments, and is genuine

    well as her negative assessment of the mother’s credibility. What she did not
    do was offer any explanation as to why she rejected the uncontested expert
    evidence. This evidence involved assessments of independence put forward by
    three separate experts who actually met with the children at different points
    in time over a long period and whose expertise was directly focused on the
    issue of whether the children’s views were their own. The experts said that they
    were.</p>

    since birth and the children would likely lose their primary caregiver if

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Approaching the
    matter from first principles I have no hesitation in concluding that where a
    grant of asylum has been made by the Home Secretary it is impossible for the
    court later to order a return of the subject child under the 1980 Hague
    Convention. Equally, it is impossible for a return order to be made <span
class=Underline>while an asylum claim is pending</span>. Such an order would
    place this country in direct breach of the principle of non-refoulement. It is
    impossible to conceive that the framers of the 1980 or 1996 Hague Conventions
    could have intended that orders of an interim procedural nature could be made
    thereunder in direct conflict with that key principle. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This same reasoning applies to a potential

lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The OCL’s submissions (and the mother’s

    Ontario exercise its jurisdiction to make custody and access orders for the
    children under s. 23 of the <em>CLRA</em>, should have been adjourned pending
    the refugee determination. I disagree for three reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, it is the s. 40(3) return order that
    would engage the non-refoulement principles, not the s. 23 analysis. Section
    40(3) empowers the court to make a return order in extra-provincial matters. The
    section reads:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><b><span lang=EN-CA>40. </span></b><span
lang=EN-CA>Upon application, a court,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) that

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) that
    may not exercise jurisdiction under section 22 or that has declined
    jurisdiction under section 25 or 42,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>may do any
    one or more of the following:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>1. Make
    such interim order in respect of the custody or access as the court considers
    is in the best interests of the child.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><i><span lang=EN-CA>2</span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>. Stay the application subject to,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>i. the
    condition that a party to the application promptly commence a similar
    proceeding before an extra-provincial tribunal, or</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>ii.
    such other conditions as the court considers appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>3. Order a party to
    return the child to such place as the court considers appropriate and, in the
    discretion of the court, order payment of the cost of the reasonable travel and
    other expenses of the child and any parties to or witnesses at the hearing of
    the application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 40 confers broad powers on the court and
    unlike the terms of the <em>Hague Convention</em>, does not <em>require</em> a
    return of the child to his or her habitual residence absent engagement of the
    harm exception. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A return order must not be made under s. 40(3) in
    the face of a pending refugee claim. This is consistent with the submissions of
    Amnesty, CARL, and the UNHCR, all of whom stressed that it was the execution of
    the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>removal order under s. 40(3)</span></em> that extinguishes the refugee claim. (I would leave to another day how the
    court should proceed if a return order to a signatory country was sought under
    the <em>Convention</em> in the face of a pending refugee claim).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the OCL submits that the serious harm
    analysis in s. 23 should not proceed until the refugee determination is made
    because it is only after a positive refugee determination that the children
    would have the benefit of a rebuttable presumption of the risk of harm. In <em>A.M.R.I</em>. <em>v. K.E.R.</em>, 2011 ONCA 417, 106 O.R. (3d) 1, this court held that, in
    the <em>Hague</em> <em>Convention </em>context, refugee status gives rise to a
    rebuttable presumption of a grave risk of harm on return to the child’s
    habitual residence. While <em>A.M.R.I</em>. concerned the <em>Hague</em> <em>Convention, </em>the rebuttable presumption would also apply in contemplating a return to a
    non-signatory country in the face of refugee status.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It defies common sense to require children to await
    a refugee determination because the case for serious harm may get stronger. If
    the court is satisfied as to serious harm, it may exercise jurisdiction under
    s. 23 and proceed to make custody and access orders for the children even
    before the refugee determination. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>The OCL is concerned that in the face of a pending refugee claim a
    court might, as here, conclude that it is not satisfied as to serious harm
    under s. 23 and the rebuttable presumption would be lost. In other words, if
    the court is not satisfied that the child would, on the balance of
    probabilities, suffer serious harm as required by s. 23, the court would not exercise
    its jurisdiction. This, it is suggested, would render unavailable the
    rebuttable presumption of harm for the purposes of s. 23 articulated in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>A.M.R.I</span></em><span lang=EN>. when the child ultimately
    qualifies as a refugee. I do not share this concern. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>When the issue is potential harm to children, the
    courts must always be guided by the children’s best interests. If a rebuttable
    presumption of harm arises from a refugee determination following an adverse s.
    23 finding, the court would be required to revisit the s. 23 determination using
    the rebuttable presumption flowing from the child’s new status as a refugee.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Under s. 23, the court must be satisfied that the
    child would, </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>on the balance of probabilities</span></em><span
lang=EN>, suffer serious harm. When the child becomes a refugee, </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>A.M.R.I.</span></em><span lang=EN> requires a fundamental shift in
    the court’s approach by introducing a rebuttable presumption that the child
    would </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>with some certainty</span></em><span lang=EN> suffer serious harm. Introducing a rebuttable presumption means the court must
    consider harm differently for the purpose of s. 23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>When a request is made for the court to exercise
    jurisdiction under s. 23 in the face of a pending refugee claim, but the court
    is not satisfied that the serious harm requirement has been met, the court may
    want to consider exercising its power under s. 40(2) to stay the proceedings until
    the refugee claim is determined. However, even when the court concludes that
    the s. 23 test was not previously met, it will always be required to revisit
    the s. 23 analysis in light of the refugee determination and through the lens
    of the rebuttable presumption of harm. Most importantly, the return order under
    s. 40 could not be made before the refugee claim is resolved.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the best interests of the child require
    that when the court is satisfied as to serious harm under s. 23, there be no
    further delay in making custody and access orders. This case demonstrates why. The
    new evidence describes that the children are anxious, exhibiting physical
    symptoms, and unsure of their immediate future. A delay is not in their best
    interests.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>DISPOSITION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I have concluded that the evidence establishes
    that the children would, on a balance of probabilities, suffer serious harm if
    returned to their habitual residence of Kuwait. Ontario therefore may and
    should exercise jurisdiction to determine custody and access.  I have also
    concluded that it was an error to order the return of the children pending the
    determination of their refugee claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
