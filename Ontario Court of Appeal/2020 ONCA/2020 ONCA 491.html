  <p class=MHeading12 align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-CA>I. OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal arises out of a dispute between
    neighbours at Jack Lake over where the lot line between their properties ends. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Jack Lake is a reservoir lake within the
    Trent-Severn Waterway. The lot line between the two properties – the most
    westerly parcel of Lot 41 and the most easterly parcel of Lot 42 – skews the
    water’s edge and strikes the lake at an oblique angle. What water level is to
    be used in determining the termination point of the lot line?  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Does the lot line between Lots 41 and 42 end where
    it intersects with the “High Water Mark” shown in Registered Plan 33 which
    created the lots in 1958 and which the trial judge found was the water’s edge
    of Jack Lake at the Normal Controlled High Water Level, a contour elevation of
    106.33 feet (assumed datum)?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Or, as the appellant contends, must the determination
    of the terminus of the lot line begin with reference to the water’s edge at the
    time of the 1902 Crown patent of lands of which the disputed lands were a part? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the trial judge, approximately 100
    feet of valuable water frontage is at issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We agree with the appellant that the trial
    judge’s conclusion that the lot line ends at the Normal Controlled High Water
    Level is tainted by reversible error and that the determination of the terminus
    of the lot line must begin with reference to the water’s edge of Jack Lake at
    the time of the Crown Patent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As we will explain, we return this matter to the
    trial court for determination. </span></p>
  <p class=MHeading12 align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-CA>II
    BACKGROUND</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As we return this matter to the trial court, we
    will provide only a brief outline of relevant facts not in dispute. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to 1902, a “lumberman’s dam” existed on Jack
    Lake. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The chain of title to Lots 41 and 42 begins with
    a patent from the Crown, dated April 2, 1902. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By way of the Crown patent, the Crown
    transferred a 152-acre parcel of Crown Land of which Lots 41 and 42 are part to
    Frances L. Robbins. The Crown patent describes the patented lands “as shown on
    a Plan of Survey by Ontario Land Surveyor Alfred J. Cameron” (the “Cameron
    Survey”). On the Cameron Survey, Mr. Cameron certifies that it is correct on
    September 23, 1901. There is no reference to or distinction made between high
    water or low water marks on the Cameron Survey.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown Patent contained the following
    reservation:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>saving, excepting and reserving nevertheless,
    unto Us, Our Heirs and Successors the free use, passage and enjoyment of, in,
    over, and upon all navigable waters which shall or may hereafter be found on or
    under or be flowing through or upon any part of the said Parcel or Tract of
    Land hereby granted as aforesaid, reserving also right of access to the shores
    of all rivers, streams and lakes for all vessels, boats and persons, together
    with the right to use so much of the banks thereof, not exceeding one chain in
    depth from the water’s edge, as may be necessary for fishery purposes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The federal government decided to use Jack Lake
    for water storage and, in 1910, it replaced the lumberman’s dam with what is
    referred to in the trial judge’s reasons as the “Dominion Dam”.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1932, the Crown settled a claim by the
    successor in title of the patentee, paying her $400 to release the Crown from
    liability for damages caused by the Dominion Dam flooding the land. The release
    describes the lumberman’s dam as having “held the water at a certain level
    during the Spring of the year, admitted of the said lake being later drained to
    its natural level”. It also notes that the Dominion Dam has a crest that is
    2’10” higher than the lumberman’s dam.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1958, the Jack Lake Land Company (“JLL”)
    subdivided the land by Registered Plan 33, resulting in the creation of Lots 41
    and 42. Registered Plan 33 was surveyed by W.A. Beninger between March 8, 1957
    and May 30, 1958 (the “Beninger Survey”). His survey shows the line between
    Lots 41 and 42 extending to a heavy curved line marking the limit of Jack Lake
    which the Plan Legend indicates is the “High Water Mark”. Mr. Beninger tried to
    retrace the Cameron Survey, but his field notes indicate that the Cameron Survey
    was poorly done, as it appeared that Mr. Cameron had only completed a rough
    shore traverse. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 11, 1974, JLL transferred the
    appellant’s property to Viceroy Construction Company Limited pursuant to the
    legal description in Plan 33. The parties’ agreed statement of facts indicates,
    and the trial judge found, that after this transaction, JLL ceased to operate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In turn, the appellant and the respondents purchased
    their properties pursuant to the legal description in Plan 33. The appellant
    owns the most westerly parcel of Lot 41, and the respondents own the most
    easterly parcel of Lot 42. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since the registration of Plan 33, other
    surveyors have completed plans and surveys of lands within Plan 33, but the
    line between Lots 41 and 42 remains the boundary between the parties’
    properties. A further subdivision of Lot 41 on May 1, 1978 and a building
    location survey of Lot 41 by Thos. E. Lyons, dated February 22, 1989, also
    described the water boundary as the “High Water Mark.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Plans of subdivisions of Lot 42 in 1987, 1991
    and 2002 described the water boundary as “Normal Controlled High Water Level
    Contour of Elevation 106.33 (feet) Also Limit of Lot 42 Reg’d Plan No 33”. The
    1987 and 1991 plans also include the notation “The Original High Water Mark of
    Jack Lake cannot be determined with any certainty therefore a portion of Lot 27
    Concession 9 may lie in front of Parts 1 and 3”.</span></p>
  <p class=MHeading12 align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-CA>III THE
    TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><em><span lang=EN-CA>The expert evidence</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Each party called a surveyor as an expert
    witness. Both were qualified by the trial judge to provide opinions as to where
    the terminus of the lot line between Lots 41 and 42 lies and how that end point
    is determined. The respondents’ expert was Shawn O’Connor. The appellant’s
    expert was Paul Miller.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge reviewed their evidence. He
    preferred the evidence of Mr. O’Connor over that of Mr. Miller, and, where Mr.
    Miller’s evidence was inconsistent with that of Mr. O’Connor, he accepted Mr.
    O’Connor’s evidence. In particular, he accepted Mr. O’Connor’s evidence that
    the Normal Controlled High Water Level (“NCHWL”) of Jack Lake had not changed
    since Plan 33 was surveyed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In Mr. O’Connor’s opinion, on a controlled body
    of water the meaning of “high water mark” is clear: it is the NCHWL. Further,
    during the navigational season on the Trent-Severn Waterway, from the long
    weekend in May through to the Thanksgiving weekend in October, Parks Canada
    maintains the lake at the NCHWL, 106.33 feet (a.d.).<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> During the remainder of the
    year, Parks Canada maintains the lake at the normal controlled low water level,
    approximately three feet lower.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. O’Connor believed that Mr. Beninger’s survey
    was completed in the winter of 1957-1958, that Mr. Beninger determined the High
    Water Mark based on a shore traverse at that time, and, accordingly, that what
    he marked as the High Water Mark on his survey was in fact the normal
    controlled low water level. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In contrast with Mr. Miller’s opinion, Mr.
    O’Connor opined that the Cameron Survey and the Beninger Survey both clearly
    show that water was being held back. Both show an island and a bay that would
    not have existed if water had not been held at similar levels. While in Mr.
    O’Connor’s view the water level in both surveys is similar, he stated that it
    was impossible to determine with any precision the level of Jack Lake in 1902,
    when the land was patented.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the cross-sectional area of water
    flowing through the dam, Mr. Miller estimated the elevation of the original water
    level of Jack Lake to be 909.1<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> feet or 100.3 feet (a.d.), plus or minus 0.3 feet. However, the trial judge
    expressly rejected his opinion because Mr. Miller did not explain how he used
    the cross-sectional area of water flowing through the dam to arrive at his
    opinion and, absent any explanation, it was impossible to assess the validity
    of his opinion or determine if it fell within his area of expertise, namely
    surveying.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><em><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s analysis</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge described his task as
    determining what water level is to be used to determine the termination point
    of the line between Lots 41 and 42 where it strikes the lake.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Although the common law had recognized the
    boundary between land and non-tidal waters as the water’s edge, throughout the
    early part of the last century, provincial Crown policy was that the Crown
    owned the beds of navigable waters to the high water mark, including any dry
    land between the variable water’s edge to the high water mark. This policy was
    enacted in statute in 1940 by amendment to the <em>Bed of Navigable Waters Act</em>,
    S.O. 1911, c. 6.[1], which also provided a statutory definition of “high water
    mark”.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Although the amendment was repealed in 1951,
    restoring the common law, the Crown maintained its policy asserting ownership
    to the high water mark. It was not until 1970 that this policy was rejected and

    ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>1. Did the trial
    judge err in concluding that it is unambiguous that the term “High Water Mark”
    in Plan 33 means the NCHWL?</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Respectfully, in our view the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the term “High Water Mark” in Plan 33 is unambiguous and means
    the NCHWL, which is 106.33 feet (a.d.), is clearly wrong.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Plan 33 does not define what is meant by “High Water
    Mark”. It does not use the term “Normal Controlled High Water Level” or refer
    to 106.33 feet (a.d.). The trial judge’s conclusion that “High Water Mark” in
    Plan 33 means the NCHWL, which is 106.33 feet (a.d.), necessarily relied on
    extrinsic evidence, presumably the evidence of Mr. O’Connor and the plans of
    subdivision prepared decades after Plan 33 which describe the water boundary
    for Lot 42 as the “Normal Controlled High Water Level Contour of Elevation 106.33
    (feet) Also Limit of Lot 42 Reg’d Plan No 33”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s conclusion that the term “High
    Water Mark” in Plan 33 is unambiguous seems rooted in his view that <em>Walker</em> has no application to controlled inland bodies of water. However, his reasons
    for coming to that conclusion are unclear. In any event, it is unnecessary for
    us to determine whether <em>Walker</em> applies to controlled inland bodies of
    water. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even if <em>Walker</em> does not apply to
    controlled, inland bodies of water, the reference to “High Water Mark” in Plan
    33 still creates a latent ambiguity. The trial judge acknowledged that Mr.
    Beninger erroneously illustrated the location of the “High Water Mark”. Even Mr.
    O’Connor acknowledged that there “seems to be some ambiguity”, resulting from
    the Beninger Survey. When the Beninger Survey is applied to the land it
    purports to describe, the lake-ward boundary is ambiguous. It is not clear that
    “High Water Mark” means the NCHWL, as opposed to, for example, the maximum water
    level, or the water level depicted by the line on the Beninger Survey. Nor is
    it clear, in the absence of extrinsic evidence, that the NCHWL was 106.33 feet
    (a.d.) at the time of the Beninger Survey. Extrinsic evidence is necessary to
    resolve this ambiguity by ascertaining the intention of the grantor. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>2. If there is a
    latent ambiguity, does the trial judge’s finding that the intent of JLL was to

lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Again, respectfully, the trial judge’s
    conclusion that JLL intended to set the NCHWL as the water boundary in Plan 33
    cannot stand. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge said this at paras. 72 and 74 of
    his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The line between Lots 41 and 42 terminates
    where it intersects the “High Water Mark” which is the water’s edge of Jack
    Lake at the NCHWL, 106.33 feet (a.d.). It was open to the JLL Company to choose
    this boundary. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Nothing in the extrinsic evidence available to

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Essentially, the trial judge says that because
    he could not determine the water boundary of JLL’s land, he does not know
    whether JLL retained any land following its transfer. And, since he did not
    make that determination, there is nothing inconsistent with his conclusion that
    JLL intended to select the NCHWL as the water boundary in Plan 33. In effect,
    JLL might have conveyed all that it owned and, in any event, it conveyed
    sufficient title to permit the owners to construct the boathouses and slips
    referred to in the transfer documents. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, on this record, the only reasonable
    inference is that JLL intended to transfer the full extent of the title that it
    had, whatever that title might be. The parties’ agreed statement of facts
    indicated, and the trial judge found, that JLL ceased operations after it
    transferred the property in 1974. It would not have made commercial sense for
    JLL to retain any land included in the Crown patent that was below the NCHWL – what
    the parties refer to as “drowned land”.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We understand the appellant to argue either that
    the boundary of the Crown patent was fixed at the outset because the
    lumberman’s dam had suddenly and artificially altered the water level, or that
    the construction of the Dominion Dam suddenly and artificially raised the water
    level and fixed the boundary. In either case, accretion or erosion did not
    alter the boundary. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondents do not appear to take issue with
    the legal principles cited by the appellant, though they dispute that there was
    sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the building of the Dominion Dam
    resulted in a sudden increase in water level sufficient to fix the legal
    boundary, and they note that erosion can result from artificial causes. They
    argue that there is evidence of significant erosion along the disputed segment
    between 1958 and 1987 and that this was sufficient to move the legal boundary. Again,
    it is unclear whether the respondents advanced this position at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s findings of fact include that the
    Dominion Dam caused additional flooding above that of the lumberman’s dam. However,
    he did not determine whether the flooding caused by the lumberman’s dam or the
    Dominion Dam was such as to fix the legal boundary at the water’s edge of Jack Lake
    at the time of the Crown patent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the trial judge’s reasons do not
    advert to the issue of the impact of erosion or accretion on the terminus of
    the lot line between Lots 41 and 42, and he made no findings on this issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, we conclude that the effect of erosion or
    accretion on the water boundary since the time of the Crown patent, if any, should
    also be returned to the trial court. The determination of the water’s edge of
    Jack Lake, at the time of Crown patent, and the effects of erosion or accretion
    on that boundary, if any, will determine the terminus of the lot line between
    Lots 41 and 42. </span></p>

    this:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, had I been persuaded that the
    disputed line terminates somewhere beyond its intersection with Jack Lake at
    the NCHWL, I would have nevertheless found that the applicants have a riparian

    below that they had a riparian right of access that permitted them to build and
    maintain a dock on the disputed lands. It is undisputed that the respondents
    already have access to Jack Lake. Indeed, counsel for the respondents advised
    that the respondents have a lakeside dock at another point on their waterfront
    and that the dispute between the parties was triggered when they wished to
    construct a second dock on the disputed lands. The trial judge gave no reasons
    for his conclusion, nor did he explain what the riparian right of access he
    provided for was to consist of. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA> The “water’s edge of Jack Lake at the time of the Crown patent” does
    not necessarily mean the water’s edge on the day of the Crown patent in April,
    when the water level may have been unusually high. In <i>Principles of Boundary
    Law in Canada</i> (Guelph: Four Point Learning, 2016), Izaak de Rijcke states
    that “[i]n Ontario, the feature, which marks a water boundary, has been generally
    accepted as the water’s edge in its normal, calm condition”: at p. 340
    (emphasis added). Similarly, the <i>Canadian Encyclopedic Digest</i> says that
    “[w]hen applied to navigable, non-tidal bodies of water, the terms ‘bank’, ‘line
    of the bank’, ‘shore’, ‘line of the shore’, ‘margin of the water’ and ‘water’s
    edge’ are synonymous as lines of demarcation. So also ‘to the bank of the lake’,
    ‘to the lake’ and ‘to the shore’ mean <span class=Underline>to the edge of the
    water in its natural condition at low water</span>” (emphasis added): CED 4th (online), <i>Boundaries and Surveys</i>, (I.3.(c)) at § 51. </span></p>
