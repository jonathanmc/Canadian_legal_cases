  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over a period of many months, after being
    diagnosed with HIV and warned about the need to disclose his HIV status to
    sexual partners, the appellant engaged in repeated acts of vaginal sexual
    intercourse with three different women. The appellant wore condoms but did not
    disclose his HIV-positive status and was not on antiretroviral medication. The complainants
    testified that they would not have consented to having sexual intercourse with
    the appellant had they been aware of his HIV-positive status. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with multiple
    offences, including three counts of aggravated sexual assault. The trial
    focused on whether the appellant’s failure to disclose his HIV status to the
    complainants, prior to sexual intercourse, constituted fraud vitiating their
    consent to that sexual activity in accordance with the principles laid down in <em>R.
    v. Mabior</em>, 2012 SCC 47, [2012] 2 S.C.R. 584.  Although one of the complainants
    was diagnosed with HIV after her sexual relationship with the appellant, there
    was no proof that she contracted the virus from him. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Mabior</span></em><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>holds that an accused may be found guilty of aggravated sexual
    assault under s. 273(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,<i> </i>if he or she fails to disclose an HIV-positive status to a sexual partner,
    consent to the sexual activity would not have been given had the sexual partner
    known about that status, <u>and</u> there exists a “realistic possibility of transmission”
    of HIV during that sexual activity: <em>Mabior</em>, at para. 4. The unanimous
    court in <em>Mabior</em> determined that a realistic possibility of HIV transmission
    is “negated” where two factors come together and work in combination: (a) the
    non-disclosing person’s viral load (the quantity of HIV circulating in his or
    her blood) at the time of sexual relations is “low”; <u>and</u> (b) a condom is
    used during the sexual activity in question: <em>Mabior</em>, at paras. 94, 103-4.<a

&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the trial judge found as a fact that the appellant
    used a condom during every act of vaginal sexual intercourse, it is
    indisputable that the appellant did not have a “low” viral load during a number
    of those acts of intercourse. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unable to argue that he met the two-prong test
    for negating the realistic possibility of transmission of HIV, the appellant
    instead argued that the <em>Mabior</em> test should be changed to reflect the
    fact that condom use alone is sufficient to negate the realistic possibility of
    transmission. The trial judge rejected the call to adapt the <em>Mabior</em> test and found the appellant guilty on all three counts of aggravated sexual
    assault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then brought a reopening
    application, at which he sought to introduce expert evidence that use of a
    condom alone negated any realistic possibility of transmission. The trial judge
    heard and dismissed the application to reopen the trial. Convictions were
    entered and the appellant was sentenced to 42 months in custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this court, the appellant renews his argument
    and seeks to buttress it with fresh evidence. For the reasons that follow, I
    would dismiss the appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While there is much to be said for the fact that
    there have been significant medical and scientific strides in our understanding
    of HIV transmission and treatment in recent years, strides that may well inform
    the proper direction of the criminal law in the future, I do not accept that
    the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>judgment rests on a flawed understanding of the
    effectiveness of condoms at preventing HIV transmission. The appellant’s dispute
    with <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>rests on the central legal underpinnings of that
    decision. As I will explain, the reasons for those underpinnings were carefully
    explained by the unanimous court in <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>and it is not for
    this court to upend them. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND FACTS</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Sexual Activity with A.G.</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and A.G. met on a dating website.
    She estimated that they had vaginal intercourse 10 to 12 times between
    September 2013 and October 2014. That activity took place in public parks,
    behind a school, in the back seats of motor vehicles, and once at A.G.’s home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A.G. testified that she also performed fellatio
    on the appellant about 75 or 80 percent of the time that they also had sexual
    intercourse. He did not use a condom during the fellatio. He sometimes would
    ejaculate in her mouth and she would swallow his semen. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A.G. testified the appellant always wore a
    condom during the vaginal intercourse. She recalled bringing the condoms and
    thought the appellant may have also brought them sometimes. The appellant would
    put condoms on himself after he had an erection. A.G. could not recall a condom
    breaking. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When A.G. found out about the appellant’s
    HIV-positive status, she “died a little bit inside.” She felt suicidal while
    awaiting test results to determine whether she had contracted the disease. She
    ultimately tested negative. She testified that she would not have consented to
    any sexual activity with the appellant had she known his HIV-positive status.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Sexual Activity with A.C.</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also met A.C. through a dating
    website. Their sexual relationship involved mutual oral sex without condoms. It
    also involved vaginal sexual intercourse. That activity took place between July
    2013 and March 2014. Although much of their sexual activity took place at

    HIV where condoms are used has evolved since he testified in <em>Mabior</em>. Adopting
    a passage from a consensus statement prepared by Canadian experts in the field
    of HIV, Dr. Smith now emphasizes that “<u>when correctly used and no breakage
    occurs</u>, condoms are 100% effective at stopping the transmission of HIV”
    (emphasis added): see <em>Loufty</em>,<em> et al.</em>, “Canadian Consensus Statement

    percent effectiveness rate for condoms, as reflected in the Cochrane Review, is
    only applicable at a population level and, in his view, should no longer be
    used for assessing individual risk on a per sex act basis. As he said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is simply incorrect to state that <u>in
    [an] individual case</u> condoms are only 80-85% effective. In my opinion an

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my opinion, it is agreed amongst the

    are near 100% effective in preventing HIV transmission <u>if correctly used</u>.
    I say near 100% because of the negligible prospect that even when properly used,
    there may be an unknown problem with the condom that allows transmission of

    added nothing new to the evidence of Dr. Wobeser that, where condoms work
    perfectly, the HIV transmission rate is zero. The trial judge concluded, though,
    that the condom error rate across the population is still an important consideration
    when determining the realistic possibility of transmission of HIV because sexual
    intercourse takes place in the “real world” where condoms do not always perform
    perfectly. Accordingly, he concluded that Dr. Smith’s evidence was
    insufficiently cogent to be granted admission on the reopening application. The
    application was dismissed, and the matter proceeded to sentencing. </span></p>

    returns to the same argument he made at trial and on the reopening application.
    He contends that the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>requirement that condom use be
    coupled with a low viral load in order to negate a realistic possibility of
    transmission of HIV overshoots the mark. He says that condom use alone should
    be sufficient to negate the realistic possibility of transmission because
    “consistent and correct” condom use creates a zero percent chance of
    transmission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the appellant acknowledges that in rare
    situations condoms will fail, he says that this failure is strictly owing to
    incorrect usage. Therefore, according to the appellant, where a condom is used,
    regardless of the level of the HIV-positive sexual partner’s viral load, condom
    usage alone should be sufficient to negate the realistic possibility of HIV
    transmission. To displace that presumption, the appellant contends that it
    should fall to the Crown to prove condom failure. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the same time, and importantly, the appellant
    is not prepared to acknowledge that the criminal law necessarily has a role to
    play in the wake of condom failure. He argues that all issues surrounding the
    mechanics of such proof, and whether proof of condom failure could even rise to
    the level of criminality, be left to another day. Therefore, I refer to the
    appellant’s position on this appeal as a condom-alone rule. </span></p>

    join the appellant in the position that “correct” condom use alone should be
    able to negate the <i>Mabior </i>threshold of a realistic possibility of
    transmission. They ask this court to “conclude as a matter of law”, that: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(i) condom use <i>per se </i><u>can</u> negate
    a realistic possibility of transmission for the purpose of the criminal law,
    and </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(ii) there is no realistic possibility of

    own, should now be sufficient to negate the realistic possibility of
    transmission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sole issue that this court is asked to
    resolve in this case is whether, at law, <u>the use of a condom alone</u> –
    despite the presence of a non-low or perhaps even high viral load – should remove
    HIV non-disclosure cases from the reach of the criminal law, barring proof that
    the condom failed in some way. The record before this court addressed that
    issue alone, and the legal argument followed suit. </span></p>

    HIV transmission. He maintains that this court can arrive at a different
    conclusion than <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>on this point because, in determining
    the rate at which condoms fail to protect against the baseline risk of HIV
    transmission, the Supreme Court of Canada (a) relied upon Dr. Smith’s approach
    to population-level statistics, an approach that Dr. Smith no longer endorses; and
    (b) relied upon what are in hindsight flawed statistics. </span></p>

    possibility of HIV transmission, thereby removing the risk of deprivation
    necessary for consent to be vitiated under s. 265(3)(c) of the <em>Criminal

    deception and deprivation, a tactical burden may shift to the accused to
    trigger the two-part test: </span></p>

    disclose one’s HIV-positive status to an unwitting sexual partner in
    circumstances where there exists a realistic possibility of transmission of the
    virus to that unwitting partner. In my view, what is criminalized is the unilateral
    imposition of risk of very serious harm onto another person without offering
    the at-risk party an opportunity to decide whether to assume that risk, or how
    to manage that risk, before making a decision to proceed. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the reopening application, Dr. Smith
    expressed that he has changed his mind since <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>about the
    appropriateness of using population-level statistics when considering the risk
    of HIV transmission in the context of the criminal law. He reinforced this view
    in his fresh evidence on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As reflected in the <em>Mabior</em> decision<i>, </i>Dr. Smith provided evidence that the baseline risk of HIV transmission per
    act of unprotected vaginal-penile sexual intercourse (no condom and a non-low
    viral load), where the male partner is HIV-positive, varies from “study to
    study”, but is somewhere between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 384. The court also
    summarized other evidence, suggesting that the baseline risk of transmission in
    these circumstances ranges from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 1,250: <em>Mabior</em>, at
    para. 97. In this case, Dr. Wobeser referred to this baseline risk of
    transmission as around 8 in 10,000. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court relied upon the Cochrane
    Review, as put forward by Dr. Smith in <em>Mabior</em>, for the proposition
    that “consistent” condom use can reduce that baseline risk by 80 percent: <em>Mabior</em>,
    at para. 98. The court concluded that, despite the reduction in risk of
    transmission provided by condom use, something more was required to <u>negate</u> the “realistic possibility of transmission”: <em>Mabior</em>, at para. 99. That
    something more is a low viral load. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Contrary to his <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>evidence,
    Dr. Smith now eschews the use of the Cochrane Report – predicated on
    population-level statistics – to determine the effectiveness of condoms at
    reducing the risk of HIV transmission. Dr. Smith now opines that: “it is
    incorrect to state that in any individual case condoms are only 80% to 85%
    effective”  because, in his current view, <u>correct and consistent condom use</u> leads to 100 percent protection from transmission when considered on a per act
    basis where nothing goes wrong.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While Dr. Smith acknowledges that condoms do
    fail from time-to-time, it is his view that the law should only consider what
    happened in each individual case. As he puts it: “[o]ne has to find out the
    truth of what occurred” and the “legal system should not be dealing with cases
    where there [has] not been transmission”. He says that, instead, the legal
    system should only “function” by looking at the “outcome of the event”, rather
    than the risk going into the event. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In formulating his opinion, Dr. Smith relies
    upon a number of reports, including the Canadian Consensus Statement, where HIV
    physicians and medical researchers have expressed a similar view. That report
    is aimed at addressing what the authors perceive to “be at stake in <u>individual</u> criminal cases” and “does <u>not extend to HIV transmission at a population
    level</u> in relation to HIV prevention efforts” (emphasis added): at p. 136.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Within that context, the authors focus upon
    condoms that are “used correctly” and where “no breakage occurs.” The authors
    specifically point out that their opinion is based upon the assumption that the
    “condom was applied to the penis and worn throughout sex, and that no condom
    breakage occurred”: at p. 136.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[7]</span></span></span></a> Assuming these prerequisites are met, the Canadian Consensus Statement says “condoms
    are 100% effective at stopping the transmission of HIV”: at p. 136.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Smith also relies upon the International
    Consensus Statement to a similar end. That report was prepared by 20 HIV
    scientists from different regions across the world. “Correct” condom use is
    defined as a condom being worn throughout the sex act and its integrity not
    being compromised: International Consensus Statement, at s. 2.2. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Bearing that definition in mind, the International
    Consensus Statement concludes that when a condom is correctly used, in an individual
    act of sexual intercourse, there is zero risk of transmission of HIV because
    bodily fluids containing the virus, like blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid,
    vaginal and anal fluids, cannot come into direct contact with sites in the body
    of an HIV-negative person where infection can be initiated, like mucous
    membranes or damaged tissue: <em><span style='font-style:normal'>International
    Consensus</span></em> Report, at ss. 2.1 and 2.2. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, Dr. Smith relies upon the Department of
    Justice Report, that concludes with a recommendation that the criminal law
    should “<u>generally</u> not apply to persons living with HIV who … <u>are not
    on treatment but use condoms</u> … because the realistic possibility of
    transmission test is likely not met” (emphasis added): at p. 30. The appellant
    points out that in response to that report, the Attorney General of Canada
    adapted its policy direction to federal prosecutors, suggesting that the  Director
    “shall <u>generally</u> not prosecute…where the person has not maintained a
    supressed viral load but used condoms or engaged only in oral sex or was taking
    treatment as prescribed, <u>unless other risk factors are present</u>”
    (emphasis added): see Federal Prosecution Policy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown responds with evidence from two other
    experts: (a) Dr. William Yarber, a health behavioural scientist with
    specialized knowledge in the area of male condoms and problems with usage; and
    (b) Dr. David Fisman, the current Head of the Division of Epidemiology at the
    University of Toronto, with an expertise in, among other things, the epidemiology
    of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. As will be explained later, Dr.
    Yarber catalogues the multiple challenges associated with “correct” condom use
    and the difficulties in achieving a perfect latex barrier to transmission.
    Among other things, Dr. Fisman addresses the importance of using
    population-level statistics when determining the risk of transmission
    associated with a sexual activity before it is undertaken.  </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant points to the following sentence
    from <em>Mabior</em>, at para. 98, to suggest that the court did not understand
    what he argues the new evidence shows, that consistent and correct condom use makes
    for a zero risk of transmission: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Smith testified that consistent condom
    protection reduces the risk of HIV transmission by 80%, relying on the widely
    accepted Cochrane review …. It was pointed out that the 80% reduction in the
    transmission refers to consistent condom use: <u>the reduction may be larger
    for consistent <i>and </i>correct condom use, but this has not been verified
    empirically</u>. [Emphasis added.] </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and interveners argue that the new
    evidence now verifies empirically that consistent and correct condom use brings
    the risk of HIV transmission to zero and <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>should be
    adapted accordingly. Although they accept that some people are irresponsible
    condom users, they argue that the lack of due care on the part of others should
    not be visited upon responsible condom users. In other words, the criminal law
    should not be used to punish those who correctly use their condoms because
    those individuals do not place their sexual partners at risk. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The interveners clearly and helpfully summarize
    this position in the following passage reproduced from their factum: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>By definition, population-level estimates
    factor in instances where condoms are <u>not</u> used correctly; those instances
    reduce the overall observed effectiveness, at the population level, of condoms
    for HIV prevention. It is unfair to convict an individual condom user – whose
    correct use of a condom would mean zero risk of transmission – on the basis of
    a population-level estimate that condoms are “only” 80% effective in reducing
    the risk of transmission (already an exceedingly small per-act risk),
    particularly in the absence of a finding that that individual engaged in
    incorrect condom use. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, there are three overarching
    difficulties with the appellant and interveners’ position: (a) the position
    conflates “consistent and correct” condom use with the ideal scenario in which
    condoms function perfectly, thereby failing to account for real-world
    situations in which condoms do not function perfectly; (b) it is contrary to
    the principles underlying epidemiology and the criminal law; and (c) it is
    inconsistent with the <i>Charter </i>values animating the <i>Mabior </i>rule. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>“Consistent and Correct” Condom Use Does Not
    Mean Zero Risk of Transmission</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the position conflates fundamentally
    different concepts. The term “correct condom use” is used as if it were a proxy
    for knowing in advance that a condom would be used perfectly and that the
    condom would function perfectly. These are not the same things. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no dispute that a perfectly functioning
    latex condom provides a perfect barrier to HIV transmission. Indeed, the
    Supreme Court of Canada well appreciated this fact in <em>Mabior</em>, as
    reflected at para. 98 of the decision: “It is undisputed that HIV does not pass
    through good quality male or female latex condoms”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>But, as the Supreme Court of Canada also understood, condoms do not
    always work as they are intended to work: “condom use is not fail-safe, due to
    the possibility of condom error and human error”: <em>Mabior</em><i>, </i>at
    para. 98. Indeed, from time-to-time, despite the very best intentions and
    efforts of sexual partners, condoms sometimes fail to work. Dr. Smith agreed
    during cross-examination that it is “not possible to know prior to a sexual
    encounter whether perfect or correct use versus condom failure may happen.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Indeed, this court recently captured this concept in <em>R. v. Boone</em><i>, </i>2019 ONCA 652, at para. 122: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Tyndall agreed with Dr. Remis that condom
    use reduced the risk of transmission overall by about 80 percent. Dr. Tyndall
    also testified that if the condom was properly applied and did not malfunction
    during use, the risk reduction approached very near 100 percent. Of course, no
    one could know ahead of any particular sexual activity whether the condom would
    malfunction in some way.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>There is an ample record on appeal, primarily led through Dr. Yarber’s
    affidavit evidence, testimony, and accompanying reports, that supports the fact
    that sometimes condoms slip, break, leak, and otherwise fail. These events can
    happen despite efforts to the contrary. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, these problems can be magnified when condoms are used in
    less than perfect settings, such as when they are applied in the dark, in small
    spaces, in awkward positions, or under the influence of intoxicants.  To adopt
    an expression used by the trial judge in this case, in the “real world”, even despite
    the best of intentions, things can and do go wrong with condom usage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In fact, this case involves precisely some of those “real world”
    kinds of circumstances that may lean more heavily toward things going wrong:
    sexual intercourse taking place in locations that are less than conducive to
    the careful handling of this piece of latex, including in the dark in cars,
    parks, bushes, and school yards. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In addition, condom failure incidents are not always obvious. While
    some condom failure may come to the attention of the sexual participants, this
    is not always the case. As Dr. Fisman points out: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You don’t have a biophysics lab present at the
    bedside after two people have sex so that you can look and see, is there any
    compromise of the condom’s integrity… and some of it may well be unrecognized
    because you’re talking about potentially very small quantities of fluid and
    very small particles. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Indeed, the chances of noticing condom failure might be further
    minimized where one party to the sexual act has no knowledge that there is a
    risk of HIV transmission should the condom fail. Where a complainant is unaware
    of the risk, he or she may not be as vigilant with the condom use as might
    otherwise be the case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Again, the circumstances of this case underscore that fact. By way
    of example, A.C. testified that the appellant usually brought his own condoms,
    put them on himself and disposed of them. She did not pay much attention to the
    procedure. In fact, she was not even sure if the condoms contained ejaculate
    when they came off: “It was dark, so I couldn’t tell. The lights were always
    off.” As it turns out, unbeknownst to her, those condoms that she paid so
    little attention to were her sole line of defence against the baseline risk of
    HIV transmission because the appellant had not started taking antiretroviral medication
    during the many months while they were engaged in sexual acts.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, “correct” usage does not necessarily mean that the
    condom functioned perfectly. Even in situations where there is a
    well-intentioned effort to achieve perfect usage, things can and do go wrong.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Assessing Risk from a Population Level is
    Consistent with Epidemiology and the Criminal Law</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>What the appellant and interveners are really looking for is a legal
    rule that favours determining the realistic possibility of transmission by
    looking to the actual effectiveness of condoms at the exact time they are used.
    As the appellant argued on appeal, it should be for the Crown to prove beyond a
    reasonable doubt that a condom failed before the criminal law could even <u>possibly</u> apply. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This argument is inconsistent with risk assessment from an
    epidemiology perspective and is also inconsistent with the legal underpinnings
    of <i>Mabior. </i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As Dr. Fisman explains, looking to population-level statistics to
    predict risk at an individual level is the “premise that underpins the entire
    field of epidemiology” and is “crucial” to predicting “the risk for an
    individual person.” Any other approach assesses risk from an <em>ex post facto</em><i> </i>perspective, one where the harm arising from the risk has either happened
    or not. As Dr. Fisman explains: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]t’s very difficult to talk about
    probabilities when you are talking about an individual, because the event
    either happens or doesn’t happen with an individual, it’s a 0 or a 1. Whereas
    in a population we can get into estimation of risks. … Post hoc you know with
    certainty what happened, but it’s sort of horse-and-barn-door stuff, it’s
    nonmodifiable, which is why it’s important to have estimates of risk ex-ante.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In contrast, I read Dr. Smith’s evidence as essentially supporting the
    idea that, for purposes of the criminal law, risk of HIV transmission should
    only be assessed based upon the “outcome of the event”. When asked about
    whether population data has some relevance to informing the “predictive
    probability of transmission” of the virus, he answered: “Well, I think in terms
    of preventive health education it would, but in terms of just legal system it
    would not.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Dr. Smith confirmed that this is his view of “how the legal system
    should function.” He went even further and provided his opinion that the “legal
    system” should not be dealing with cases involving only risk of transmission: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I think that the legal system should not be
    dealing with cases where there [has] not been transmission. Personally, I think
    it would be reasonable for the legal system to deal with cases where there has
    been transmission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Of course, that is not a scientific or medical conclusion, but a
    legal one that is antithetical to the reasoning in both <em>Cuerrier</em><i> </i>and <em>Mabior</em><i>. </i>In my view, Dr. Smith’s evidence contains no new
    information about the effect of condom use on HIV transmission rates; rather, what
    has changed is his opinion that the criminal law should approach these risks
    differently than the Supreme Court chose to in those cases. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Although the appellant and interveners do not go quite as far as Dr.
    Smith by suggesting that only transmission cases should fall within the reach
    of the criminal law, they heavily rely upon his evidence to advance the
    position that the risk of transmission should only be looked at from an
    after-the-fact perspective. They argue that, at its highest, an after-the-fact
    inquiry should be made into whether the complainant was actually put at risk.
    This stands in direct opposition to the current forward-looking <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>approach to assessing whether there exists a realistic possibility of HIV
    transmission at the time when the unwitting sexual partner offers his or her consent
    to the sexual activity in question. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, their position is really a request to conduct a “case-by-case”
    approach to risk assessments in HIV non-disclosure cases. That approach was
    specifically rejected in <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>because of the inherent lack of
    predictability that would result from any such approach: <em>Mabior</em>, at
    paras. 68-69. Indeed, it is that very kind of approach that led to great
    uncertainty in the wake of <em>Cuerrier</em><i> </i>and why <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>came
    along to inject certainty into this complex area of the law. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is important that the criminal law be predictable. People need to
    know with some degree of certainty, before they engage in conduct, whether that
    conduct will be labelled criminal or not. The desire in <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>to
    provide clarity in the operation of the criminal law is one of the foundational
    principles upon which the decision rests, and one that pushed toward a clear
    and easily applied test for when the realistic possibility of transmission of
    HIV would be negated: <em>Mabior</em>, at paras. 14, 19. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s and interveners’ suggestion that the law move toward
    an assessment of whether there was a risk of transmission of HIV during a
    specific sexual encounter, based on whether condoms actually slipped, leaked,
    broke, or otherwise malfunctioned, would return the law in HIV non-disclosure
    cases to the undesirable world of uncertainty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, I do not accept the appellant’s suggestion that the
    criminal law is designed only to address what actually happens as a result of
    what people do, not the risk they potentially put others at while doing it.
    Indeed, there are examples of the criminal law addressing its attention to
    risks before they materialize. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the respondent points out, drinking and driving and unsafe
    storage of firearm offences constitute two examples of the criminal law
    specifically targeting perceived risk of harm before that risk is actually visited

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not wish to be taken as suggesting that drinking and driving or
    unsafe storage of firearms offences are perfect analogies to HIV non-disclosure
    sexual assault-based offences. There is one important difference between them.
    When it comes to drinking and driving and unsafe storage of firearms offences,
    members of the public are not given the choice to voluntarily assume the risks
    associated with those activities. When it comes to HIV non-disclosure cases,
    though, members of the public are given that choice. The key is that they need
    to know there is a risk before they can choose to assume that risk. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>HIV non-disclosure cases are therefore targeted at the deception

lang=EN-CA>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>To this end, I would add the crime of fraud to this discussion.
    Indeed, the essential elements of fraud were discussed at some length in <em>Cuerrier</em><i> </i>and, with some adaptation, formed the genesis of the approach to how fraud
    can vitiate consent in the HIV non-disclosure context: <em>Cuerrier</em>, at
    paras. 114-17. Drawing upon the court’s prior authorities setting out the
    elements of fraud, including reference to <em>R. v. Théroux</em></span><span
lang=EN-CA>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 5, </span><span lang=EN-CA>Cory J. emphasized in <em>Cuerrier</em> that the “essential elements of fraud are dishonesty, which can include
    non-disclosure of important facts, and deprivation or <u>risk of deprivation</u>”
    (emphasis added): at para. 116. In other words, a risk of deprivation to one’s
    economic interests, through dishonest means, is sufficient for fraud. Take away
    the dishonesty and someone can voluntarily assume the risk of financial harm. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>It is against that backdrop that the court spoke of “[o]ur modern

lang=EN-CA>In my view, the use of population-level statistics to assist in

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>From a consent perspective, it makes sense to consider the risk of
    HIV transmission during a sexual act from a forward-looking perspective. After
    all, if risk is to be looked at after condom failure, then the complainant has
    already been put at risk without having voluntarily assumed that risk. This
    hindsight approach to risk, after the risk has been involuntarily and
    unknowingly assumed, would do little for the modern-day notion of consent and
    the preservation of the “right to refuse intercourse”. In my view, the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>rule is about preventing the consenting party from having the risk of
    contracting an indisputably serious, life-altering disease unilaterally imposed
    upon him or her in the first place: <em>Mabior</em><i>, </i>at para. 88. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that the population-level statistics
    contained in the Cochrane Review are suspect. First, he says that those
    statistics – as relied upon by the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>and by Dr. Wobeser at trial – are predicated on groups of “always condom
    users” and “never condom users”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As for the always condom users, the appellant argues that there is
    likely some social acceptability bias embedded in the statistics because it
    involves self-reporting, where people will be motivated to suggest they took
    appropriate precautions prior to becoming seroconcordant (the non-HIV-positive
    sexual partner moving to a positive status). This would lead to some people
    reporting using condoms when they did not actually use condoms, causing some
    instances of transmission from sex without condoms to be recorded as
    transmission from sex with condoms. That could lead to condoms appearing less
    effective than they actually are.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant also suggests that there may have been some
    difficulties with some of the underlying studies informing the Cochrane Review.
    For instance, in one of the studies, where there had been four seroconversions involving
    people who claimed to have always used condoms, the authors of that study noted
    that there had been “improper or incomplete condom use” in a number of the
    cases. In another study, the appellant suggests that, because of the way in
    which the seroconversions were assigned to specific time frames, it may be that
    it had the effect of misclassifying the effectiveness of condoms. He argues
    that some seroconversions were assigned to timeframes during which the couple
    reported always using condoms, but transmission may have occurred during an
    earlier timeframe when they were not using condoms. Again, if this occurred, it
    would lead to condoms appearing less effective than they actually are.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This argument is rooted in the suggestion that, even if it was right
    for the Supreme Court to assess the risk of transmission of HIV with the use of
    population-level statistics, it was wrong to have uncritically accepted the
    Cochrane Review as accurately containing the condom failure error rate across
    the population. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent relies upon the evidence of Dr. Yarber, an expert on
    condom use and failure rates. The appellant challenges Dr. Yarber’s numbers,
    arguing that, in fact, the rates for condom breakage, leakage, slippage, late
    application, and early removal events are much smaller than he suggests. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The respondent disputes the appellant’s characterization of the
    statistics, claiming they are actually much higher than the appellant suggests.
    Relying upon a study that Dr. Yarber co-authored, the respondent suggests that
    condom use errors must be considered in light of studies showing the combined
    rates for different types of condom failure together, some of which are well
    over the 20 percent range: <em>Sanders et al.</em>, “Condom use errors and problems:
    a global view” (2012), 9 Sexual Health 81, at p. 90. That is, the chance of the
    condom slipping <i>or</i> breaking <i>or </i>otherwise failing – the chance of
    the condom failing in some way – can be over 20 percent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not intend to address the specific statistics for condom slippage,
    breakage, leakage, and the like. At the end of the day, in my view, the
    Cochrane Review relied upon by the Supreme Court in <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>has
    not been shaken in any meaningful way by the new evidence here. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Indeed, Dr. Smith acknowledged during cross-examination on the
    reopening application that the Cochrane Review is a meta-analysis that remains
    “widely respected as a valiant attempt to measure the average risk of
    transmission in the real world”. Dr. Smith also referred to the Liu Study that
    suggests much lower rates of transmission with condom use, but the validity of
    that study has been called into question. Dr. Fisman provides evidence that the
    study is highly questionable and, in fact, is “out of keeping with scientific
    consensus”: see <em>Liu</em>, <em>et al.</em>, “Effectiveness of ART and Condom
    Use for Prevention of Sexual HIV Transmission in Serodiscordant Couples: A
    Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis” (2014) 9:11 PLoS ONE e111175.  “Serodiscordant”
    means one partner is infected and the other is not. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I agree that the Cochrane Review, as Dr. Smith suggested on the
    reopening application, is still “widely accepted”.  Indeed, the Public Health
    Agency of Canada performed a synthesis of current medical evidence relating to
    HIV transmission rates published in 2018 and relied in part on data from the
    Cochrane Review: <em>Traversy LeMessurier</em>, <em>et al.</em>, “Risk of
    Sexual Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus with Antiretroviral Therapy,
    Supressed Viral Load and Condom Use: A Systematic Review” (2018), 190, Can. Med.
    Assoc. J. E1350. An earlier version of that synthesis was also relied upon by
    the Department of Justice in determining the rate of HIV transmission when
    condoms are used alone: Department of Justice Report, at p. 8. The
    International Consensus Statement also relied on the Cochrane Review: see fns.
    17, 22, 69.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>According to Dr. Fisman, whose evidence I accept, the Cochrane
    Review represents a “reasonable” assessment of condom effectiveness across the
    population, “as imperfect as that is.” For every act of vaginal intercourse,
    the Cochrane Review concluded that condom use resulted in an 80.2 percent
    relative reduction in HIV transmission, the best-case estimate being 94.2
    percent and the worst-case estimate being 35.4 percent. In other words, as Dr.
    Fisman put it, condoms “could be better than we think they are” or they could
    be “worse than we think they are.” Indeed, the Cochrane Review itself
    acknowledges that condom effectiveness could be under- or overestimated by the
    study and, importantly, the Supreme Court of Canada had that evidence before it
    when <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>was decided. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Even if the reduction rate for the transmission of HIV is slightly
    higher than what the Cochrane Review suggests, the fact remains that, from an
    admissibility perspective, that new evidence is not sufficiently cogent to be
    granted admission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While the appellant quarrels with the precise reduction in risk of
    transmission arising from condom use alone, even if he is right, his position
    cannot succeed. To this end, it is notable that the Supreme Court decided that
    the potential reduction in baseline HIV transmission rates arising from the
    taking of antiretroviral medication was in the range of 89 to 96 percent: <em>Mabior</em>,
    at para. 101. Yet the court was not satisfied that even that level of reduction
    in baseline risk of transmission could qualify as negating the realistic
    possibility of HIV transmission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Therefore, even if I were to accept (which I do not), that at a population
    level, the use of condoms alone reduce the risk of transmission of HIV up to even
    the 96 percent mark, on the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>analysis, that would still
    be insufficient, on its own, to negate the court’s view of what constitutes a realistic
    possibility of transmission.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I conclude this section by making two practical observations in
    response to the appellant’s and interveners’ characterization of the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>decision as criminalizing an “infinitesimal” risk of transmission. They
    emphasize that the baseline risk of HIV transmission is so “infinitesimal” that
    it cannot possibly rise to the level of a realistic possibility of harm, let
    alone when that baseline risk is pulled down by another at least 80 percent
    through condom use. I note that the appellant and interveners are not alone in
    that position: Martha Shaffer, “Sex, Lies, and HIV: Mabior and the Concept of
    Sexual Fraud” (2013),<i> </i>63 U. Toronto L.J. 466, at pp. 472-73; Isabel
    Grant, “The Over-Criminalization of Persons with HIV” (2013), 63 U. Toronto
    L.J. 475, at pp. 479-80.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is important to note, though, that the argument suggesting that
    there is only an “infinitesimal” risk of transmission arises from statistics predicated
    on two things: (a) a per-sex-act consideration of risk; and (b) only the
    baseline risk relating to vaginal-penile intercourse.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, the baseline statistic for risk of transmission in <em>Mabior</em> is based upon a single act of vaginal-penile intercourse. As pointed out by Dr.
    Wobeser, though, that risk repeats itself with every repeated act of sexual
    intercourse. Therefore, even if the per-act baseline risk, as reduced by condom
    use, could be called “infinitesimal”, one cannot lose sight of the fact that the
    risk adds up over time. In other words, even if the risk of engaging in a
    behaviour with an infected partner once could be called infinitesimal, when
    that behaviour is repeated, so too is the risk of transmission. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As Dr. Fisman explained, the risk is “cumulative with each sexual
    act”, meaning that following a number of sex acts involving the same
    serodiscordant couple, the “Bernoulli (or coin-toss) model” would apply. The
    “risk of the event occurring at least once would be estimated using a formula”
    that applies an “exponent equivalent to the number of sex acts that have
    occurred”. Put simply, the risk of transmission exponentially increases with
    each sexual act involving the same serodiscordant couple.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, the repeated risk of harm that comes with each act of
    sexual intercourse between the same serodiscordant couple partially informs the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>rule that condom use alone does not negate the “realistic
    possibility of transmission”. While some HIV non-disclosure cases involve
    one-time encounters, others involve repeated acts of sexual intercourse where
    there is no disclosure made to the unwitting partner, such as the acts of
    vaginal sex with A.G. and A.C. in this case. Clearly, the cumulative risk for
    these complainants rose with each act of intercourse. <i> </i> </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, I would make the observation that, when it comes to sexual
    intercourse, the baseline transmission rates differ somewhat significantly between
    vaginal and anal intercourse. One systemic review, adopted in the Department of
    Justice Report, at p. 10, places the baseline transmission rate for “receptive
    vaginal intercourse” (risk to the receptive partner) at 8 in 10,000 (0.08
    percent), while it places the transmission rate of “receptive anal intercourse”
    at 138 in 10,000 (1.38 percent). See also International Consensus Statement, at
    ss. 2.3.2. and 2.3.3.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, these two factors, cumulative risk over many sex acts,
    and differing baseline risks depending upon the nature of the sex acts, informs
    the wisdom of the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>approach in creating a singular, easy-to-understand,
    and easy-to-apply rule for the application of the criminal law. Under the
    present <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>regime, the criminal law cannot apply
    differently based upon the nature of a sexual act or the number of times those
    acts take place within the same serodiscordant couple. Any other approach would
    carry serious implications in terms of equality and return this already complex
    area of the law to the world of uncertainty.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, while the statistical backdrop for the <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>decision may be at the low end of what is meant by a realistic possibility
    of transmission, there are other scenarios to which the statistical backdrop
    looks much different. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>There is no doubt that the criminal law is the bluntest of

lang=EN-CA>Nor can there be any doubt that the stigma associated with a
    criminal conviction only compounds the difficulties of those living with HIV,
    an already vulnerable group, many of whom come from historically marginalized

lang=EN-CA>The fact is that there are many different models for how to approach
    HIV non-disclosure cases. Some of those other models were reviewed by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <em>Mabior</em>: at paras. 49-55. And, as noted in <em>Mabior</em><i>, </i>at para. 51, there are few jurisdictions that criminalize deception that only
    exposes a partner to the risk of transmission (as opposed to actual
    transmission). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Not only is the deception that exposes a sexual partner to a risk of
    transmission criminalized in Canada, but the most frequently chosen path of
    prosecution is by way of the most serious sexual offence known to law:
    aggravated sexual assault, an offence punishable by up to life in prison. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Although this appeal raises the singular issue of the effectiveness
    of condoms at preventing HIV transmission, there is much to be said for the
    fact that other things may have changed since <em>Mabior</em>. A prime example
    of change involves the current understanding around suppressed and undetectable
    viral loads. This significant change is reflected in the policies of some Attorneys
    General in Canada not to prosecute matters involving these circumstances. There
    are others, like the federal Attorney General, who have also started to put in
    place specific condom-related prosecution policies, directing that, as a
    “general” rule, there be no prosecutions in situations where condoms are used
    as long as there are no other risk factors present. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The ability of the common law to adapt is important in this context.
    Even so, the interveners’ arguments call upon this court to overturn the clear
    legal result in <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>based upon policy arguments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>While there may come a day where there is a reconsideration of the
    intersection between the law of aggravated sexual assault and HIV
    non-disclosure risk of transmission cases, this is not that case. The sole
    issue raised in this appeal relates to the suggestion that, since <em>Mabior</em><i>, </i>there have been changes to how we should understand the effectiveness of
    condoms at preventing HIV transmission. To that end, I adopt the trial judge’s
    observation that “when the scientific evidence as a whole is examined with
    respect to condom use in real life situations, nothing has changed in the past
    five years from the time <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>was decided in 2012 to the
    present day”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The <em>Mabior</em><i> </i>decision reflects the Supreme Court’s
    appreciation for the fact that perfectly operating latex condoms provide a
    perfect barrier to the transmission of HIV. It also reflects the court’s
    understanding that sex happens in the real world and that, in that world, human
    error and condom failure are concerns across the population. It also reflects
    the court’s decision to criminalize the risk of transmission from a
    forward-looking perspective, one that takes into account the need for certainty
    in the criminal law. Finally, it accommodates an interpretation of s. 265(3)(c)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em> that is consistent with our modern notion of
    consent to sexual activity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In my view, there is nothing in the new evidence that reveals a
    change in the facts upon which <em>Mabior</em><i>’s </i>legal reasoning rests. The
    fresh evidence on appeal is not cogent and is not admissible. The trial judge
    did not err in excluding Dr. Smith’s evidence on the reopening application. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA> Although the <i>Mabior</i> decision does not specifically define

lang=EN-CA> Although the complainants in this case testified about also having
    had condomless oral sex with the appellant, the trial judge’s reasons focus on
    the risks of transmission associated with the acts of vaginal intercourse. Therefore,
    these reasons are similarly focused on the acts of vaginal sexual intercourse.  </span></p>
