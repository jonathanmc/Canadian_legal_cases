    pending his conviction and sentence appeal. He was convicted after a trial by
    judge and jury of the second degree murder of his son, Mr. Michael McRae. He was
    sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 12 years: <em>R.
    v. McRae</em>, 2018 ONSC 4035.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant was released on bail before his
    conviction for almost two years without incident. He now proposes a release
    plan pending appeal on terms much like those governing his release at first
    instance.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s position is <span style='color:black'>that
    while </span>this application for bail is a “close call”, it opposes bail because
    the applicant has failed to establish that his detention is <span
style='color:black'>not necessary </span>in the public interest under s.
    679(3)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</span></p>

    his son were alcoholics. They had lived together on and off for over 30 years, enduring
    a destructive relationship fraught with mutual hostility. Both had been
    drinking heavily on the day of the stabbing.</span></p>

    stabbing his son and slitting his throat, but claimed that he had acted in
    self-defence because earlier that day his son had “kicked the shit out of” him,
    and had threatened to kill him, saying: “You’re no good for fuck all … You’re
    better dead. I’m going to fucking kill you one day.” The applicant testified
    that, after this initial altercation, his next clear memory was later the same day
    when his son kicked open his bedroom door and said: “You’re gonna die tonight
    you old bastard.” The applicant testified that he stabbed and killed his son
    moments after this threat.</span></p>

    two of the three years between the offence (July 7, 2015) and the jury verdict

    incident.</span></p>

    of Kane J. on October 19, 2015 following a contested application. Kane J.
    rejected the Crown’s position that bail should be denied mainly on the tertiary
    ground (s. 515(10)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>), to maintain confidence in
    the administration of justice:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The potential strength of the defence to be

    to the seriousness of the charge and the brutal circumstances of the deceased’s
    death.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown applied to Strathy C.J.O. to direct a panel
    of the Court of Appeal to review Kane J.’s release order. Strathy C.J.O.
    dismissed the Crown’s application. He ruled that Kane J.’s decision was
    reasonable, a proper exercise of discretion, and one that a panel of the court
    would be unlikely to second-guess:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While the killing was horrific, the full
    circumstances paint a more nuanced picture: an elderly parent living with a
    violent, abusive and addicted son; a long and dysfunctional relationship
    characterized by abuse, intoxication and violence; an accused with significant
    health and addiction challenges, but making real progress addressing his
    addiction while on bail; the absence of recent criminal activity, <span
style='color:black'>except when </span>involving the victim; a strong plan for
    release; a probable delay of at least three years until trial, meaning that if
    not released an elderly accused would spend three years in a provincial remand
    facility awaiting trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant remained on bail until January 31,
    2017, when he was remanded into custody at his own request. He wished to serve
    more pre-trial custody because of the potential for a long prison sentence if
    convicted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant remained in custody from January
    31, 2017 to December 1, 2017, when he was released again by order of Kane J.,
    again after a contested application. The applicant sought to be released
    because his health had deteriorated while he had been in custody, including his
    heart condition, diabetes, gallstones, and a broken arm caused by falling from
    a bunk. Kane J. acknowledged that the applicant’s daughter and surety, Ms.
    Terri McRae, with whom he had lived while on bail, had been convicted of
    impaired driving in January 2017, but was satisfied that this did not render
    her unfit to act as a surety because she agreed to a condition that there would
    be no alcohol in her house. Kane J. noted there was no suggestion that the
    applicant had consumed alcohol or had otherwise breached the bail conditions
    during his earlier release. He found the Crown’s position on the application
    was “a collateral attack of the original decision granting bail, which was
    denied leave to appeal. This is another case of the Crown’s preference for
    detention rather than bail”: <em>R. v. McRae</em>, 2017 ONSC 7145, at para. 48.
    Kane J. ordered the applicant’s release on terms broadly similar to his earlier
    release, but with enhanced terms in relation to alcohol.</span></p>

    until his conviction on June 14, 2018. Again, there was no suggestion that the
    applicant breached any of the conditions of his release.</span></p>

    as being potentially engaged and was mentioned in each of the bail decisions of
    Kane J. and the bail review decision of Strathy C.J.O. The defence of
    provocation was also included in the draft rolled-up charge, but the trial
    judge removed it from the final charge because he saw no evidence of
    provocation. Neither the Crown nor defence counsel <span style='color:black'>at

    that the trial judge erred in law by not instructing the jury on provocation.
    The applicant asserts that the defence should have been put to the jury because
    the defence had an air of reality – the applicant’s testimony about his son’s
    provocative threat to kill him, leading to the applicant’s anger, moments
    before he stabbed his son. The applicant also submits that failing to instruct
    the jury on provocation was significant because during deliberations the jury
    had asked the trial judge about how they could use the evidence of the
    applicant’s anger. The trial judge consulted with counsel and reminded them,
    “remember, we don’t have provocation here so I took provocation out of the
    rolled-up [charge] because we didn’t instruct on provocation”. The trial judge
    then re&#8209;charged the jury and instructed them that “anger is not a
    defence” but could be considered with the other evidence as to whether the
    applicant had the intent for murder. The applicant says the jury was left with
    the impression that the applicant’s anger was relevant only to the intent for
    murder, even though it could also have <span style='color:black'>been relevant

    For now, because of the Crown’s concession <span style='color:black'>that </span>there
    was an air of reality to the defence of provocation, this ground of appeal <span
style='color:black'>clearly </span>surpasses the threshold of being “not
    frivolous”.</p>
  <p style='
text-align:justify;line-height:200%'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the second ground of appeal relating to the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Scopelliti </span></em>and <em><span lang=EN-CA>Corbett</span></em> applications, a
    preliminary assessment of this ground leads me to conclude that, while not
    frivolous, it faces significant challenges. The trial judge’s decisions on
    these applications will be entitled to appellate deference: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. R.D.</span></em>, 2019 ONCA 951, at para. 13; <em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Joseph</span></em>, 2020 ONCA 73, at para. 72. As counsel for
    the applicant fairly acknowledged in oral submissions, the trial judge’s
    dismissal (in part) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Scopelliti </span></em>application
    would not have left the jury with the misapprehension that Michael was an
    angel. On balance, I conclude that it weighs somewhat but not heavily in favour
    of reviewability.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    on the hearsay ground of appeal, the applicant relies on <em><span lang=EN-CA>R.
    v. Delellis, </span></em>2019 BCCA 335. The British Columbia Court of Appeal
    held that the trial judge “<span lang=EN-CA>erred in telling the jurors that
    evidence of past threats made by the deceased victim could not be used to the
    appellant’s benefit unless found to be truthful”: <em>Delellis</em>, at para. 3.
    The court found that the hearsay instruction was given in error, because it was
    adduced not for the truth of its contents but as evidence relevant to the
    appellant’s state of mind. The court found that the erroneous hearsay
    instruction gave rise to a reversible error, as the jury’s ability to rely on
    this evidence was unfairly restricted: <em>Delellis</em>, at paras. 117-120. While
    the limiting instruction in <em>Delellis </em>appears to have been more
    extensive than the hearsay caution at the applicant’s trial, this ground of
    appeal certainly surpasses the “not frivolous” threshold, and therefore also weighs
    in favour of reviewability</span><span style='line-height:200%'>.</span></p>

    is also a factor that may be <span style='color:black'>considered as </span>part
    of the public interest criterion, though the weight to be given to it depends
    on the particular circumstances of each case: see e.g., </span><em><span

    2020 ONCA 280, at para. 36. Here, the applicant is elderly and has serious underlying
    medical conditions. This puts him in a class of people particularly vulnerable
    to COVID-19. I have given this factor <span style='color:black'>some </span>weight.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I have concluded that <em>prima facie</em> the
    enforceability interest is strong, given the seriousness of the offence for
    which the applicant was convicted, but is attenuated somewhat by the lack of
    flight risks and the substantially reduced public safety risks, given the
    applicant’s proposed plan of release and the absence of issues during his
    earlier release.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I have also concluded that the reviewability
    interest is stronger than asserted by the Crown, especially because of the
    Crown’s concession in oral argument that the trial judge erred by failing to
    instruct the jury on provocation. The other grounds of appeal add further
    weight to the reviewability interest. I also note that the applicant has served
    three years of his sentence, and while the appeal will be perfected by September
    4, 2020, it will not be heard for some months after that.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When I weigh the enforceability and
    reviewability interests, I conclude that the reviewability interest overshadows
    the enforceability interest and therefore the applicant’s detention is <span

    through the eyes of a reasonable member of the public who is thoughtful,
    dispassionate, informed of the circumstances, and respectful of society’s
    fundamental values, public confidence in the administration of justice would be
    maintained if the applicant were to be released pending appeal. I <span
style='color:black'>reach this conclusion because of </span>the attenuated
    public safety concerns, the absence of flight risks and the strong plan of
    supervision with a proven track record of success, the applicant’s advanced age
    and health challenges in <span style='color:black'>the context of </span>the <span
