  <p class=Heard>Andreea Baiasu, for the respondent</p>
  <p class=Heard>Heard: June 10, 2020 by videoconference</p>
  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on April 24, 2017
    by Justice Douglas K. Gray of the Superior Court of Justice, with reasons
    reported at 2017 ONSC 2330. </p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Watt J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jeffrey Drury (“the appellant”) exchanged hundreds of messages with “Tiffany”.
    Jeffrey Drury was 52 years old. Tiffany said she was 15. The appellant’s
    messages were overtly sexual or had sexual overtones.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant agreed to meet Tiffany for what he hoped would be a sexual
    encounter. Or maybe not. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant arrived at the time and place of the meeting. But Tiffany
    was not there. Instead, the appellant was met and arrested by several police
    officers.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a judge-alone trial in the Superior Court of Justice, the
    appellant was found guilty of child luring under s. 172.1(1)(b) and two counts
    of transmitting sexually explicit material to a person believed to be under 16,
    contrary to s. 171.1(1)(b). The trial judge entered a conviction on the child
    luring count and conditional stays on the transmitting sexually explicit
    material counts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These reasons explain why I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction
    and order a new trial. I would also set aside the conditional stays on the
    counts of transmitting sexually explicit material so that the new trial will
    take place on the indictment as a whole. </p>
  <h2>The Background Facts </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The grounds of appeal advanced do not require a detailed examination of
    the nearly 1000 electronic communications between the appellant and his
    interlocutor, Tiffany. An overview of those communications and a brief sketch
    of the positions advanced by trial counsel (neither of whom are counsel on
    appeal) are sufficient to provide the background necessary to understand the
    nature of the errors alleged and my determination of their merits. </p>
  <h3>The Advertisement </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant spent a significant amount of time on the Internet. He
    frequented various sites, including some with sexual subject-matter. From time
    to time, he advertised his interest in participating in sexual activities with
    his collocutors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant posted one such advertisement on Craigslist, in the “casual
    encounters” section. The advertisement consisted of a header, a photograph of a
    male grasping an erect penis and text soliciting a sexual encounter with a
    female. The advertisement made no reference to the age of any putative
    respondent. </p>
  <h4>The Response </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s advertisement soon caught the attention of a member of the Ontario Provincial
    Police (OPP) who was monitoring the site. The officer – a member of the OPP’s
    Child Exploitation Unit – decided to respond by Craigslist chat, posing as a
    15-year-old girl named Tiffany. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within
    minutes, the appellant responded to Tiffany. He asked Tiffany to send him a
    picture. He indicated age did not matter and inquired about a meeting that same
    evening. No meeting occurred. </p>
  <h4>The Communications </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the first two weeks when they communicated over Craigslist chat, Tiffany and the
    appellant switched to email. Over a period of about two months, they exchanged
    117 Facebook messages and 878 emails. Three emails sent by the appellant
    included sexually explicit photographs.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    time to time during his exchanges with Tiffany, the appellant pointed out that
    15 was, as he put it, “illegal”. In response to repeated requests for a photograph,
    Tiffany sent a picture of a fully-clothed female police officer, posing as a
    teenager taking a selfie. The appellant researched the name Tiffany had
    provided. He found that a person by that name was a 24-year-old woman from the
    same city in which Tiffany claimed to live. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some communications, the appellant speculated that Tiffany might be a man, a
    much older person or even a police officer. Tiffany downplayed the suggestions
    in her responses, treating them in a joking manner. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the appellant sent Tiffany numerous photographs during this exchange. From
    one of the photos, police were able to discern the licence plate number on a
    motorcycle. A vehicle registration check confirmed the appellant’s name and
    residential address. </p>
  <h4>The Meeting Arrangements </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant arranged to meet Tiffany at a gas station in the city in which she
    claimed to live. The appellant drove to the meeting place from his home some
    considerable distance away. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the meeting place, there was no Tiffany, as there never had been. Only police
    officers who arrested the appellant. </p>
  <h3>The Appellant’s Version </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified as the only defence witness at trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, then a 55-year-old man who had been separated from his wife for over
    a decade, explained that he was unsure that Tiffany was 15 years old as she
    claimed. Just because Tiffany said so did not make it true since, in his
    experience, people lied about their age online. He tried to find out Tiffany’s
    true identity and age by asking questions and examining her emails for
    age-appropriate responses. He thought she could have been a police officer or
    an older person posing as a 15-year-old girl. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was also suspicious of Tiffany’s reported age because the person in
    the photograph she sent appeared older than 15. And Tiffany seemed to know a
    lot about Jeeps and automotive repairs, albeit she claimed to have learned
    these things from her father who had these interests. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his testimony at trial, the appellant denied any interest or intention to have
    sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl at any time. As for the arranged meeting,
    the appellant just wanted to have a “fun day” with Tiffany, to “hang out” and
    “go Jeeping”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination the appellant conceded that he was aware of the possibility
    that Tiffany was in fact 15 years old. However, he considered this unlikely,
    since the person in the photograph Tiffany sent was clearly older. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also maintained a contemporary journal of his activities and thoughts
    – “Story 11” – that was filed as an exhibit at trial. Despite the similarity in
    some of its contents with those of his emails with Tiffany, the appellant
    characterized Story 11 as fantasy, only loosely based on real people and
    events. </p>
  <h2>The Positions of the Parties at Trial </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel for the Crown contended that the evidence proved the appellant’s guilt
    on all three counts beyond a reasonable doubt. The Crown relied on the
    presumptions in ss. 171.1(3) and 172.1(3) to establish the appellant’s belief
    in the underage status of Tiffany from her representation of it, absent
    evidence to the contrary. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    there was no evidence to the contrary, the Crown argued, because the appellant’s
    testimony was unworthy of belief. In addition, the appellant could not invoke
    any defence of mistaken belief in age because he had failed to take the
    reasonable steps required by ss. 171.1(4) and 172.1(4). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant acknowledged authorship of the electronic communications
    attributed to him, including the sexually explicit photographs. However, trial
    counsel contended, the evidence failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the appellant believed that Tiffany was 15 years old. In particular,
    counsel pointed to the appellant’s emails and his Facebook inquiry about the
    person whose name Tiffany had adopted. What is more, the appellant took
    reasonable steps to ascertain Tiffany’s true age. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, trial counsel contended that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant’s <em>purpose</em> in his electronic communications
    and transmission of sexually explicit material was to facilitate the commission
    of the secondary offence of sexual interference. </p>
  <h2>The Grounds of Appeal </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant advances a single ground of appeal which he says requires that both
    the conviction and the conditional stays be set aside and acquittals entered. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding beyond a reasonable
    doubt the appellant believed Tiffany was 15 by applying the presumption of
    belief in ss. 171.1(3) and 172.1(3) and the failure to take reasonable steps
    disqualifier under ss. 171.1(4) and 172.1(4). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal argument challenges the conviction of child luring, so I address that
    argument first. </p>
  <h3>The Conviction of Child Luring </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    brief reference to the reasons of the trial judge is sufficient to furnish the
    background necessary to appreciate the claims of error alleged. </p>
  <h3>The Reasons of the Trial Judge </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge delivered written reasons for his decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    recounting the relevant background, summarizing the parties’ positions and
    setting out the relevant offence-creating provisions, the trial judge began his
    analysis by referring to “two presumptions” that assisted the Crown in proving
    both offences charged: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>In both cases, the Crown is assisted by two presumptions:  </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>a) where it was represented to the accused that the person
    with whom he or she communicated was under the age of 16 years, then, in the
    absence of evidence to the contrary, that is proof that the accused believed
    that the person was under that age; </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>b) it is not a defence that the accused believed that the
    person was at least 16 years of age, unless he or she took reasonable steps to
    ascertain the age of the person.   </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    referring to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>R. v. Legare</em>,
    2009 SCC 56, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 551, and <em>R. v. Levigne</em>, 2010 SCC 25, [2010]
    2 S.C.R. 3, the trial judge turned to ss. 171.1(4) and 172.1(4) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i><em><span style='color:black;font-style:normal'>, </span></em><span
style='color:black'>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46</span>. Each of these sections limits
    the defence of honest but mistaken belief in the age of the interlocutor to
    cases in which an accused has taken reasonable steps to ascertain the
    interlocutor’s age. He then rejected the appellant’s claim that he had taken “reasonable
    steps”:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Drury testified that the following circumstances convinced
    him that in all likelihood the person with whom he was communicating was over
    age 16: </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    received no clear responses to his suggestions that the person was an adult or
    a police officer;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The person
    with whom he was communicating seemed to know a lot about automobiles and
    Jeeps;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The person’s
    Facebook page had very little detail about the person;</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    picture sent by the person appeared to be of someone older than 16; </p>
  <p class=DSubquote>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Drury
    Googled the person and discovered a person named Tiffany Creechan aged 24
    (Officer Rees denied he was this person).</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>In my view, this does not constitute the taking
    of reasonable steps in the circumstances of this case. At the very least, Mr.
    Drury was still in doubt as to whether the person was really 15 years of age.
    None of the steps he took gave him any real information as to the person’s age.
    What he did was simply not reasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>As I noted earlier, the communications between Mr. Drury and
    Officer Rees disclose some inconsistency as to the purpose of the
    communications, and Mr. Drury’s ultimate purpose. His recordings as reflected
    in Story 11 also show some equivocation. However, at the end of the day, based
    on my assessment of all of the communications and reflections and Mr. Drury’s
    evidence, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Drury engaged in
    the communications and sent sexually explicit material, in order to facilitate
    a sexual encounter with a person whom he believed was a 15-year-old girl.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also rejected defence counsel’s argument that the contemporaneous
    journal – Story 11 – was reflective of the appellant’s fantasies, rather than
    his thoughts, intentions and purposes. The trial judge concluded that, viewed
    as a whole, Story 11 demonstrated the appellant’s underlying hope and intention
    to have sex with Tiffany. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the penultimate paragraph of his reasons, the trial judge explained his
    conclusion in these terms: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Based on all the evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that Mr. Drury did not take reasonable steps to ascertain the true age of
    the person with whom he was communicating. Accordingly, he cannot rely on the
    defence that he believed the person with whom he was communicating was over 16
    years of age. He was advised that that person was aged 15. For the purpose of
    the relevant provisions of the <em>Code</em>, that constitutes proof that Mr.
    Drury believed that the person was under age 16, in the absence of evidence to
    the contrary. There is no evidence to the contrary as contemplated in the
    relevant statutory provisions. Indeed, it is clear from Story 11 that Mr. Drury
    either believed the person was under age 16, or at best was not sure. If he was
    not sure, it was because he had not taken reasonable steps to ascertain the
    interlocutor’s true age.  </p>
  <h2>The Arguments on Appeal </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant challenges the trial judge’s finding that the Crown had proven beyond
    a reasonable doubt that he believed that his interlocutor – Tiffany – was under
    16 years old. In reaching that conclusion, the appellant says the trial judge erred: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in relying on the presumption (since declared unconstitutional) in s.
    172.1(3) of the<em><span style='color:black'> Code</span></em>; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in grounding his conclusion on the appellant’s failure to take
    reasonable steps, thus depriving him of the mistaken belief defence in s. 172.1(4). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='color:black'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant acknowledged at trial that he was the author of the
    telecommunications sent to Tiffany. On appeal, he does not challenge the trial
    judge’s finding that the purpose of these telecommunications was to facilitate
    commission of the secondary offence of sexual interference, contrary to s. <span
style='color:black'>151 of the<em> Code</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant continues, the Crown advanced two discrete but related
    bases to establish the appellant’s belief that Tiffany was under 16. First, the
    Crown relied on evidence that Tiffany represented herself to the appellant as
    15 years of age as proof that the appellant believed her to be that age. At the
    time of trial, this method of proof was available to the Crown under s. 172.1(3),
    absent evidence to the contrary. And there was no evidence to the contrary
    because the appellant failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain Tiffany’s
    real age, as contemplated in s. 172.1(4). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    that was then and this is now. Things have changed with respect to how the
    Crown may prove this aspect of the fault element in s. 172.1(1)(b). The
    presumption of belief based on evidence of a representation of age is no longer
    available. And the alternative path, based on an absence of reasonable steps,
    is equally unavailable. The role of s. 172.1(4) is to limit the defence of
    mistaken belief in age, not to establish (in combination with the presumption) the
    essential element at issue here: the appellant’s belief that Tiffany was under
    16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the appellant says, the Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
    either that the appellant believed or that he was wilfully blind to the fact that
    his interlocutor – Tiffany – was under 16 years of age. Near recklessness as to
    her age was not sufficient. It was incumbent on the Crown to establish this essential
    element without the assistance of either s. 172.1(3) or s. 172.1(4). A fair
    reading of the trial judge’s reasons reveals that, but for the combined
    operation of those two provisions, he had a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    believed Tiffany was underage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent contends that a fair reading of the reasons for conviction, together
    with the reasons for sentence, demonstrates that the trial judge was satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant believed Tiffany was under 16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent accepts that at the time the trial judge rendered his decision, the
    Crown was permitted to rely on the combined operation of ss. 172.1(3) and (4) to
    establish the appellant’s belief that Tiffany was underage. In this case,
    however, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence not because he
    failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain Tiffany’s age, but because the
    appellant was not credible and his evidence not reliable when stacked up
    against his communications with Tiffany and his recorded recollections in Story
    11. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge acknowledged that certain evidence suggested the appellant was
    suspicious that Tiffany was older than she claimed to be. But he rejected this
    evidence as not raising a reasonable doubt that the appellant believed Tiffany
    was underage. This finding was not made by recourse to the presumption or the
    reasonable steps requirement. The appellant’s defence was not that he honestly
    believed Tiffany was overage, but rather that he did not believe she was underage.
    This was the trial judge’s core finding. Anything said about the failure to
    take reasonable steps as a separate pathway to a finding of guilt was
    superfluous and does not undermine the judge’s central conclusion. </p>
  <h2>The Governing Principles </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles that govern our decision on this ground of appeal are those that
    explain the role of ss. 172.1(3) and (4) in proof of an offence under s. 172.1(1)(b)
    of the<em> Code</em>. Unfortunately, the most recent and authoritative
    exposition of these principles – <em>R. v.</em> <em>Morrison</em>, 2019 SCC 15,
    [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3 – had not been released when the trial judge decided this
    case. </p>
  <h3>The Statutory Provisions </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with child luring under s. 172.1(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. That section provides: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>172.1 (1) Every person commits an offence who, by a means of
    telecommunication, communicates with</p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DSubquote>(b) a person who is, or who the accused believes is, under
    the age of 16 years, for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an
    offence under section 151 or 152, subsection 160(3) or 173(2) or section 271,
    272, 273 or 280 with respect to that person.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the offence-creating provisions in s. 172.1(1), the section
    contains an evidentiary presumption grounded on a representation about the age
    of the recipient. Section 172.1(3) provides: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(3) Evidence that the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a),
    (b) or (c) was represented to the accused as being under the age of eighteen
    years, sixteen years or fourteen years, as the case may be, is, in the absence
    of evidence to the contrary, proof that the accused believed that the person
    was under that age.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    172.1(4) limits the availability of the defence of mistaken belief in age. The
    subsection provides: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>(4) It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b)
    or (c) that the accused believed that the person referred to in that paragraph
    was at least eighteen years of age, sixteen years or fourteen years of age, as
    the case may be, unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the age
    of the person.</p>
  <h3>The Authorities </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    offences in s. 172.1(1), including s. 172.1(1)(b), are incipient or inchoate
    crimes that capture otherwise legal conduct meant to culminate in the
    commission of a crime – the secondary offence alleged in the count charged. The
    criminalized conduct precedes not only the commission of the secondary offence,
    but even an attempt to commit that offence: <em>Legare</em>, at para. 25; <em>Levigne</em>,
    at para. 27. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essential elements of the preparatory offence of s. 172.1(1)(b) may be briefly
    characterized as: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>communication; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>recipient; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>purpose. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>The means of <em>communication</em> must be by
    telecommunication. The <em>recipient</em> must be a person who is (or the
    accused believes is) under 16. And the <em>purpose</em> of the communication
    must be to facilitate the commission of a listed offence (the secondary offence)
    with the recipient: <em>Legare</em>, at para. 36; <em>Levigne</em>, at para. 23.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this case concerns the <em>recipient</em>. In this case, the recipient
    – Tiffany – was a fiction, thus not actually a person under 16. Accordingly,
    the Crown was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant <em>believed</em> Tiffany was under 16: <i>Morrison</i>, at paras. 95-96. It was not enough for
    the Crown to prove that the appellant hoped or even suspected that Tiffany was
    underage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    term “belief” refers to the mental acceptance of a statement, fact, doctrine or
    thing as true or existing. The term “hope” denotes the expectation of something
    desired, a feeling of expectation and desire combined:<i> Oxford Dictionary of
    English</i>, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2010). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    assist in proving that the appellant believed Tiffany was under 16, Crown
    counsel invoked the presumption of belief in s. 172.1(3). Under that provision,
    the mere representation by Tiffany that she was 15 was sufficient to prove that
    the appellant <em>believed</em> she was 15, absent evidence to the contrary: <em>Levigne</em>,
    at para. 30. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> An
    accused may provide evidence to the contrary – i.e., that he believed his collocutor
    or interlocutor was at least 16 – only if he took reasonable steps to ascertain
    her age: <i>Criminal <em>Code</em></i>, s. 172.1(4); <em>Levigne</em>, at para.
    31. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of trial, the governing authorities permitted the Crown to establish
    the appellant’s belief in Tiffany’s underage status by proving beyond a
    reasonable doubt either that the appellant believed Tiffany was under 16 or that
    he failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain Tiffany’s true age: <em>Morrison</em>,
    at para. 28. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    these two independent pathways to establish this essential element of the offence
    are now closed to traffic. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Morrison</em>, the Supreme Court declared the presumption of belief in s.
    172.1(3) to be of no force or effect because it breached s. 11(d) of the <i>Canadian <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em></i> and was not saved by s. 1: <em>Morrison</em>,
    at paras. 11, 73. In the result, a mere representation that the recipient of a
    telecommunication was under 16 cannot establish an accused’s belief that the
    recipient was under 16, even in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The accused’s
    belief must be affirmatively established without the assistance of the
    presumption – that is, by evidence adduced at trial establishing the requisite
    belief beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>Morrison</em> court also concluded that s. 172.1(4) did not, in the absence
    of the presumption under s. 172.1(3), provide an independent pathway to
    conviction: <em>Morrison</em>, at paras. 80, 82. Rather, what s. 172.1(4) does
    is to limit a defence of honest but mistaken belief in the age of the
    interlocutor. If the Crown proves beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused did
    not take reasonable steps to ascertain the interlocutor’s age, this precludes
    the trier of fact from considering the defence that the accused honestly
    believed the interlocutor was of legal age: <em>Morrison</em>, at para. 83. But
    it remains for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, without the
    assistance of the presumption in s. 172.1(3), that the accused believed the
    interlocutor was underage: <em>Morrison</em>, at para. 83. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    a prosecution under s. 172.1(1)(b) originates in a police sting and no underage
    person exists, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt three essential
    elements: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an intentional telecommunication; </p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with a person whom the accused believes is under the requisite age; and </p>
  <p class=CQuote>iii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for the purpose of facilitating the commission of a designated offence
    with respect to that person. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>See <em>Morrison</em>, at para. 95.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second element requires the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    accused <em>believed</em> the interlocutor was underage. Since the presumption
    of belief in s. 172.1(3) is no longer of any force or effect, the Crown cannot
    establish this element simply by proving that the interlocutor represented her
    age and that the accused failed to take reasonable steps to ascertain the
    interlocutor’s true age. What the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is
    that the accused either: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>believed; or </p>
  <p class=CQuote>ii.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was wilfully blind whether </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>the interlocutor was underage: <em>Morrison</em>, at
    paras. 96-97. Recklessness as to the interlocutor’s age is not sufficient: <em>Morrison</em>,
    at paras. 100-101. </p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I will explain, I would give effect to this ground of appeal, set aside the
    conviction of child luring under s. 172.1(1)(b) and order a new trial. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal contested ground at trial related to what I have characterized as the
    “<em>recipient</em>” element in s. 172.1(1)(b). To prove this element when
    there was no underage person, the Crown was required to establish beyond a
    reasonable doubt that the appellant actually believed or was wilfully blind
    whether Tiffany was under 16. Proof that the appellant was reckless – i.e.,
    that he was aware there was a danger that Tiffany was underage, but proceeded notwithstanding
     – was not good enough. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    prove the appellant’s belief, the Crown, in accordance with the applicable law
    as it stood at the time of trial, relied on the fact that Tiffany had represented
    herself as 15. This representation, absent evidence to the contrary, triggered
    the presumption in s. 172.1(3) and established the appellant’s belief that
    Tiffany was underage. There was no evidence to the contrary because the
    appellant’s testimony revealed that he had taken no reasonable steps to
    ascertain Tiffany’s real age. The presumption of belief was not rebutted
    because of the failure to take reasonable steps and that failure afforded a
    second pathway to establish guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    critical passage appears at para. 83 of the trial judge’s reasons, which I
    repeat here for the sake of convenience: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Based on all the evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that Mr. Drury did not take reasonable steps to ascertain the true age of
    the person with whom he was communicating. Accordingly, he cannot rely on the
    defence that he believed the person with whom he was communicating was over 16
    years of age. He was advised that that person was aged 15. For the purpose of
    the relevant provisions of the <em>Code</em>, that constitutes proof that Mr.
    Drury believed that the person was under age 16, in the absence of evidence to
    the contrary. There is no evidence to the contrary as contemplated in the
    relevant statutory provisions. Indeed, it is clear from Story 11 that Mr. Drury
    either believed the person was under age 16, or at best was not sure. If he was
    not sure, it was because he had not taken reasonable steps to ascertain the
    interlocutor’s true age.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Proof
    that the appellant believed or was wilfully blind to the fact that Tiffany was
    under 16 was an essential element of the offence charged. The Crown was not
    entitled to invoke the presumption of belief from the underage representation
    to establish or even help establish this essential element. Nor was it entitled
    to rely upon the absence of reasonable steps to negate any evidence to the
    contrary or to afford a discrete pathway to conviction. The trial judge, quite
    understandably, adopted this approach in light of the existing jurisprudence.
    After <em>Morrison</em>, however, a finding of guilt recorded on these bases
    can no longer stand. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, invoking s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Code</i>, asks this court to sustain
    the conviction despite the errors I have identified. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my respectful view, the provision is not up to the task the respondent has
    assigned to it. The error in this case is not harmless. It relates to the
    principal issue in controversy at trial. Nor is this a case in which the
    evidence of guilt is overwhelming. </p>
  <h3>The Conditional Stays </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of trial, the trial judge entered conditional stays of
    proceedings on the counts alleging offences under s. 171.1(1)(b). Trial counsel
    were in agreement that this result followed from the principles established in <em>Kienapple
    v. R</em>., [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, the appellant asks us to set aside the conditional stays and enter
    verdicts of acquittal on these counts. He says that result should follow
    because, like the presumption in s. 172.1(3) declared of no force or effect in <em>Morrison</em>,
    the presumption in s. 171.1(3), which is in the same terms, is also of no force
    or effect. He invokes the same argument he made in connection with the
    conviction of child luring and seeks the same result. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant did not challenge the constitutionality of s. 171.1(3). In
    this court, however, he gave the notice required for a constitutional challenge
    and asks that we declare s. 171.1(3) of no force or effect. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent resists both claims on a principled basis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    settle this controversy, it is sufficient to briefly canvass the positions of
    the parties and the principles that govern the issues raised. </p>
  <h4>The Arguments on Appeal </h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the critical issue of whether he believed Tiffany was underage, the appellant
    says the trial judge’s findings of guilt are flawed by the same process of
    reasoning that vitiated the conviction of child luring. The presumption of
    belief in s. 171.1(3) is just as constitutionally deficient as its sibling in s.
    172.1(3) and should be declared of no force or effect. And the pathway to a
    finding of guilt based on the failure to take reasonable steps, which <em>Morrison</em> deemed impassable, is equally inaccessible in prosecutions under s. 171.1. As a
    result, the appellant asks that he be acquitted on both counts under s. 171.1(1)(b). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent contends that what the appellant seeks is not available to him. In
    one instance, as a matter of law. In the other, as an exercise of discretion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rights
    of appeal, the respondent says, are entirely statutory. In proceedings on
    indictment, an accused has a right of appeal against conviction under s. 675(1)(e)
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. But an accused has no right of appeal from a
    conditional stay of proceedings. Thus, his only right of appeal to this court
    is against the conviction of child luring. <em>Finis litium</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the respondent continues, the determination of the appeal from the
    appellant’s conviction of child luring is dispositive of the conditionally stayed
    charges. A favourable result means that the conditional stay is lifted and a
    new trial ordered on the indictment as a whole. An unfavourable result renders
    the stay permanent, the equivalent of an acquittal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent concedes that appellate courts retain discretion to permit arguments
    to be advanced for the first time on appeal. But there is no reason to exercise
    that discretion in the appellant’s favour here. A pronouncement on the
    constitutionality of s. 171.1(3) is not necessary to decide this case. The
    record in this court is immature and better developed in the trial court where s.
    1 evidence may be tendered if considered advisable. </p>
  <h2>The Governing <span style='line-height:200%'>Principles </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>It is beyond controversy that rights of appeal are

    e.g. <em>Alberta (Attorney General) v. Malin</em>, 2016 ABCA 396, 344 C.C.C. (3d)
    420, at para. 25. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    674 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> makes it clear that for indictable offences,
    only appeals authorized by Part XXI and, to a much lesser extent, Part XXVI,
    may be taken: <em>Malin</em>, at para. 26. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    person convicted by a trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal
    against that conviction under s. 675(1)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. But
    neither s. 675 nor any other provision in Part XXI or Part XXVI affords an
    accused a right of appeal against a stay of proceedings whether entered
    conditionally under the principles of <em>Kienapple</em> or otherwise.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    stay entered in accordance with the principles in <em>Kienapple</em> is
    conditional on the final disposition of the charge on which the accused has
    been convicted: <em>R. v. Provo</em>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, at p. 16. Where the
    conviction has not been appealed, or, if appealed, the appeal has been
    eventually dismissed, then the conditional stay becomes permanent and the
    functional equivalent of a judgment or a verdict of acquittal for appeal or
    special plea purposes. On the other hand, if the accused’s appeal against
    conviction has been allowed, the conditional stay is dissolved and an appellate
    court may remit the matter to the trial court for future disposition: <em>Provo</em>,
    at p. 16. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    final point concerns the constitutional issue raised for the first time in this

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a general rule, appellate courts will not permit an issue to be raised for the
    first time on appeal. The principle is grounded on concerns for: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>i.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>prejudice to the opposing party who lacks the opportunity to respond and

  <p class=CQuote>iv.<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    related principle is also important. It has been held repeatedly that courts
    should not decide issues of law, especially constitutional issues, that are not
    necessary to the resolution of the case before the court: <em>Phillips v. Nova
    Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy)</em>, [1995] 2 S.C.R.
    97, at paras. 5-11. </p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied </h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I will explain, I would not give effect to the appellant’s submissions in
    connection with the conditional stay entered on the counts of transmitting sexually
    explicit materials. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    contrary to the appellant’s apparent position, he has no statutory right of
    appeal against a conditional stay of proceedings. Neither Part XXI nor Part XXVI
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em> provides any such right. Without such a statutory
    provision, s. 674 makes it clear that no appeal is available. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the disposition of the conditionally stayed charges is governed by the
    disposition of the appeal against conviction of the child luring offence. Since
    I would allow that appeal and order a new trial on that count, the conditional
    stays on the counts of transmitting sexually explicit materials dissolve and
    those counts are remitted to the trial court for a new trial on the indictment
    as a whole. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    it is not necessary to the resolution of this appeal to decide the
    constitutional issue with respect to the stayed charges under s. 171.1(1)(b).
    We lack a sufficient record to make the determination requested and to decide
    the issue at first instance here would be to deny the respondent the
    opportunity to adduce evidence under s. 1 if so advised.</p>
  <h2>Disposition </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and
    conditional stays and order a new trial on all counts in the indictment.</p>
