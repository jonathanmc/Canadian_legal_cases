    in methadone. He has served his 18-month sentence and has abandoned his
    sentence appeal. He says the trial judge erred in her dismissal of his s. 11(b) <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> application and in her treatment of the
    expert evidence at trial. He requests a stay of proceedings. In the
    alternative, he seeks a new trial.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and Jason MacDonald were residents
    at a transition home known as Discovery House in Guelph, Ontario. The appellant
    was under the care of a physician with Ontario Addiction Treatment Centres. He
    was given access to methadone and had been approved for take-home doses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At around 9:00 a.m. on March 13, 2017, the appellant
    was administered one dose of methadone and received three additional doses for
    March 14, 15, and 16, 2017, from the clinic where he was being treated. He immediately
    brought them back to his room at Discovery House. The trial judge found that upon
    arriving home, the appellant gave Mr. MacDonald one dose of the methadone. Mr.
    MacDonald and his girlfriend, Bridgette Podniewicz, overdosed on the methadone
    they consumed in Mr. MacDonald’s bedroom. Tragically, Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald died as
    a result. Fortunately, Ms. <a name="_Hlk46325273">Podniewicz</a> was revived in
    hospital.</span></p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence at Trial</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s case against the appellant was
    largely circumstantial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Podniewicz testified about conversations she
    had with the appellant and Mr. MacDonald concerning the appellant’s access to
    methadone, the exchange of methadone for cigarettes, although she did not see any
    exchange, and the effects of methadone. On March 13, 2017, Mr. MacDonald went
    out to get some coffee, donuts and cigarettes. After he returned, and shortly
    after 9:00&nbsp;a.m., Ms. Podniewicz heard the front door of the residence
    close, and Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald went to see if the appellant had returned. Mr.
    MacDonald left his bedroom and then returned with a bottle of methadone. She
    testified that Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald poured them drinks from the bottle and then
    later “finish[ed] the bottle”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Police were called to investigate a sudden death
    at Discovery House. They attended and found Mr. MacDonald to be dead and Ms.
    Podniewicz to lack vital signs. She was transported to hospital where she was
    revived. Before being taken to the police station, the appellant asked if he
    could take his medication with him and opened a locked box in his bedroom closet.
    Two full bottles of methadone with March 15 and 16, 2017 ingestion dates remained
    in that locked box. An empty bottle of methadone, bearing a label with an ingestion
    date of March 14, 2017 and the appellant’s name, was later seized from the
    appellant’s bedroom closet and identified by Ms. Podniewicz as the bottle Mr.
    MacDonald brought into his bedroom.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Swabs of the inside of the empty methadone bottle
    and its cap seized from the appellant’s closet were sent to the Centre of Forensic
    Sciences (“CFS”) for analysis. Blood was also taken for analysis from Mr.
    MacDonald’s body and Ms.&nbsp;Podniewicz. The contents of two glasses from Mr.
    MacDonald’s room from which Ms. Podniewicz said they drank were also analyzed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the toxicology and DNA expert
    evidence submitted at the appellant’s trial, methadone was found in a short
    glass, one of the glasses from which Ms. Podniewicz said they drank; methadone
    was found in the blood of Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald and Ms. Podniewicz; and Mr.
    MacDonald could not be excluded as the source of DNA found on the short glass,
    the lip of the methadone bottle and the bottle cap. The probability that the
    DNA found belonged to someone other than Mr. MacDonald was less than one in one
    quadrillion. The appellant maintained that Mr. MacDonald’s DNA was placed on
    the items by way of a secondary or tertiary transfer because the bottle was
    placed on the appellant’s bed after seizure and not swabbed until it was
    returned by Health Canada following testing for methadone.</span></p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial Judge’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge dismissed the appellant’s application
    for a stay of proceedings pursuant to s. 11(b) of the <em>Charter</em>. The information
    was sworn on March 17, 2017 and the appellant’s trial ended on January 9, 2019.
    The trial judge concluded that, while the delay was presumptively unreasonable
    given that it exceeded the 18-month ceiling set out in <em>R. v. Jordan</em>,
    2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, the Crown had established exceptional
    circumstances that rebutted the presumption. In particular, the trial judge found
    that the delay was principally caused by the parties’ good faith but mistaken
    estimate of the number of days required for the trial. As a result, once that
    period of time and the largely conceded defence delay were deducted, the time
    that this matter took to complete was well under the presumptive 18-month
    ceiling for matters before the Ontario Court of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge convicted the appellant of
    trafficking methadone because she was satisfied that there was no other
    reasonable inference from the trial evidence other than Mr. MacDonald receiving
    the methadone from the appellant. In particular, she based this conclusion on her
    findings that (1) Mr. MacDonald’s DNA was found on the lip of the methadone
    bottle and the interior of the bottle cap because he drank from it; (2) the
    appellant received three methadone doses to take with him on the day of Mr. MacDonald’s
    overdose, two of which were found in a locked box in the appellant’s bedroom;
    (3) the empty methadone bottle containing Mr. MacDonald’s DNA was found in the
    appellant’s bedroom closet; (4) Ms. Podniewicz was a party to conversations between
    the appellant, Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald and her concerning the exchange of methadone
    for cigarettes and the effects of methadone; and (5) she testified that she consumed
    methadone with Mr. MacDonald.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Issues and analysis</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant raises two issues on his conviction
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, he argues that the trial judge erred in
    dismissing his s. 11(b) <em>Charter</em> application to stay the proceedings for
    delay because (1) she failed to include, in her consideration of delay, the
    period between January 9, when the trial concluded, and January 23, 2019, when
    the ruling on the <em>Charter</em> application and the verdict were rendered;
    and (2) she mischaracterized the period from September 13, 2018 to January 9,
    2019 as an exceptional circumstance. Had she included those periods, the appellant
    argues, the delay would have exceeded the presumptive ceiling by over four
    months in breach of the appellant’s s. 11(b) <em>Charter</em> rights. Therefore,
    in his submission, the proceedings should be stayed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, and in the alternative, the appellant argues
    the trial judge misapprehended the evidence given by one of the forensic experts
    concerning the presence of Mr. MacDonald’s DNA on the appellant’s methadone
    bottle. This misapprehension, the appellant submits, was central to the trial
    judge’s reasoning and led to the appellant’s conviction. Therefore, if the
    proceedings are not stayed, the appellant seeks a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am not persuaded by these submissions and would
    dismiss the appeal.</span></p>

    is well established. Deference is owed to a trial judge's underlying findings

lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As required in the first step of the <em>Jordan</em> analysis, the trial judge calculated the total delay from the charge to the actual
    end of the trial on January 9, 2019: <em>Jordan</em>, at para. 60; <em>R. v. Cody</em>,
    2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 21. She determined that 21 months
    and 25 days had elapsed from the charge on March 17, 2017 to the conclusion of
    his trial on January 9, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although she did not have the benefit of the Supreme
    Court’s decision in <em>R. v. K.G.K.</em>, 2020 SCC 7, 443 D.L.R. (4th) 361, the
    trial judge correctly concluded that the appropriate end date for the purpose
    of determining if the delay exceeded the <em>Jordan</em> presumptive ceiling was
    the end of the trial rather than the rendering of the verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <em>K.G.K.</em>, the Supreme Court clarified
    that while the protection of s. 11(b) extends beyond the end of the evidence
    and argument at trial, up to and including the date upon which the sentence is imposed,
    the <em>Jordan</em> presumptive ceilings do not include verdict deliberation
    time. They apply from the date of the charge until the actual or anticipated end
    of the evidence and argument and no further: at paras. 3, 23, 31, 33 and 50. The
    Court explained that the <em>Jordan</em> ceilings were not designed to exhaust
    the s. 11(b) analysis and cover all sources of delay. Rather, they represent a specific

    the police’s submission of various items to the CFS for toxicological and DNA testing
    until June 2018. The Crown conscientiously responded to further requests for disclosure
    including the technical underpinnings for the reports and provided reports and
    further disclosure upon receiving them. Defence counsel was on leave and requests
    for further disclosure did not start until August 2018. The trial judge also recognized
    the Crown’s efforts to mitigate the delay by securing an additional trial day in
    August 2018 and in October when a fourth date was being canvassed, when it
    became obvious to the parties that further trial days would be required. While
    not attributable as defence delay but rather as efforts to mitigate delay, the

  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Trial Judge Did Not Misapprehend the DNA Expert Evidence</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    by misapprehending the evidence given by the Crown’s forensic expert, Christian
    Taylor, concerning the mechanism of transfer of the DNA onto the methadone
    bottle. Specifically, the appellant says that the trial judge failed to consider
    Mr. Taylor’s response during cross-examination that he could not opine one way
    or the other about whether a primary or secondary transfer of the DNA to the methadone
    bottle was more likely. As a result, the appellant argues, the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the DNA was transferred to the methadone bottle because Mr. MacDonald
    put his lips on that bottle was speculative and therefore erroneous.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to the appellant, the possibility of a
    secondary or tertiary transfer of the DNA by the placement of the bottle on the
    appellant’s bed prior to forensic testing was just as likely. Given that these
    findings were crucial to the trial judge’s verdict, the appellant requests a new
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept these submissions. The trial judge
    did not misapprehend Mr. Taylor’s evidence. Moreover, her conclusion that Mr.
    MacDonald put his lips on the methadone bottle was supported not only by the DNA
    evidence, but by other evidence that the trial judge was entitled to accept.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is important, first, to put what the appellant
    calls Mr. Taylor’s “clarification” of his opinion into the proper context of the
    entirety of his evidence. Mr. Taylor opined that given the amount and quality of
    DNA retrieved for testing, the primary transfer of DNA from person to item was more
    likely. While he could not absolutely exclude the possibility of indirect
    transfer of DNA from Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald, he said: “[From] the amount of DNA we
    recovered and the quality of the profile, I would not expect to be able to obtain
    these DNA results from tertiary transfer or secondary DNA transfer in the
    absence of a body fluid”. Mr. Taylor opined that the possibility of an indirect
    transfer was an “extreme scenario”, absent “some very rich source of DNA on the
    bed sheet and it was handled, rubbed against that bed sheet quite a bit, and
    then there’s vigorous handling to somehow get that DNA from the outside of the
    bottle to the inside of the bottle”. Not knowing all the specific circumstances
    of this case, for example, whether there was evidence of a wet body fluid on the
    appellant’s bedclothes, and because the performed tests did not seek to identify
    the specific type of bodily fluid that was the source of the DNA in this case,
    Mr. Taylor was unable to say with certainty how in actual fact the transfer took
    place.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That Mr. Taylor did not have sufficient information
    to allow him to opine as to the exact mechanism of the transfer of Mr.
    MacDonald’s DNA does not modify or attenuate his core opinion that based on the
    amount of DNA and quality of the DNA profile retrieved in this case, primary
    transfer was the most likely mechanism absent the secondary transfer originating
    from a very rich source of DNA such as a wet body fluid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It was up to the trial judge, not the forensic expert,
    to determine how Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald’s DNA was deposited on the methadone bottle
    based on all the evidence before her. The DNA expert opinion evidence was only
    one piece of evidence on which the trial judge relied for her conclusion that: “I
    find that Mr.&nbsp;MacDonald put his lips on that methadone bottle. That is how
    the DNA ended up on the lip of the bottle, not due to contamination from shared
    living arrangements, from being put on [the appellant’s] bed or from being sent
    to Health Canada.”</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s conclusion was also supported
    by other evidence that she was entitled to accept. Ms. Podniewicz testified
    that she had participated in conversations about the appellant’s access to
    methadone, the exchange of methadone for cigarettes, and the effects of
    methadone; that Mr. MacDonald returned to his bedroom with one of the methadone
    bottles identified as belonging to the appellant; and that he drank from the
    short or the long glass, and the methadone bottle. The toxicology report confirmed
    that Mr. MacDonald and Ms.&nbsp;Podniewicz had methadone in their blood and
    there was methadone in the short glass. The empty methadone bottle was one of
    the three doses issued to the appellant that morning and was found in the
    appellant’s closet. The other two full bottles with later ingestion dates were
    in the appellant’s locked box in his bedroom closet.</span></p>

    inference that could be drawn was that the appellant had given the methadone to
    Mr. MacDonald was firmly rooted in the evidence that the trial judge was entitled

    scenario” postulated by Mr.&nbsp;Taylor that could have resulted in a detectable
    secondary or tertiary transfer of Mr. MacDonald’s DNA on the methadone bottle
    and cap. I agree with the trial judge’s determination that such an inference would
