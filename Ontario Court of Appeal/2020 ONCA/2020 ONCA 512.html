    2019.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering align=center style='text-align:center'><strong><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-weight:normal'>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant pled guilty to and was convicted of the sexual
    assault of his estranged wife and use of an imitation firearm</span>. He was sentenced
    to a four-year custodial sentence less pre-sentence custody of 31.5 months.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from his sentence. With the able assistance of duty
    counsel, he submits the sentencing judge made the following reversible errors:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge <span lang=EN-US>erroneously considered
    premeditation of the sexual assault as an aggravating factor that materially
    impacted his sentence for that offence. The inference of premeditation of the sexual
    assault was not the only reasonable inference open to the sentencing judge on
    the agreed statement of facts.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient enhanced credit for pre&#8209;sentence
    custody. The additional amount of four months allotted by the sentencing judge
    for the harsh conditions that the appellant endured while in custody prior to
    sentencing was so low that it resulted in an error of law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant himself made the submission that the three-year probationary
    period was too long and unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The agreed statement of facts amply supports the sentencing judge’s
    finding that the entire sequence of events resulting in the offences committed
    by the appellant was the product of deliberate planning and premeditation, trickery
    and luring.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the agreed statement of facts that formed the foundation of
    the appellant’s guilty plea, under the admitted false pretence of collecting
    winnings from a bet to share with her, the appellant lured his estranged wife
    to a motel room that he had previously reserved. To persuade her to enter the motel
    room, he told her others would be present, which the appellant also admitted
    was false. Once his estranged wife was inside the motel room, the appellant locked
    and barred the door with handcuffs that he had brought with him and a chair. He
    advised her that he was going to kill himself, showing her what appeared to be
    a firearm and bullets that he had previously placed in a drawer in the motel room,
    but that he would first sexually assault her, which he did. He told his estranged
    wife that he would not use the firearm against her but that he would become
    physical if she tried to leave or use her cell phone. Out of fear that he would
    kill himself, the appellant’s wife remained with him overnight and then drove
    him the next morning for food and back to his car.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, it would have been highly artificial for
    the sentencing judge to separate out the different components of what was clearly
    planned as a sequence of events that the appellant intended to and did commit against
    his estranged wife and against her will. The sentencing judge did not stray
    beyond the agreed facts; any inferences that the sentencing judge drew followed
    clearly from what was set out in the agreed statement: <em>R. v. Druken</em>,
    2006 NLCA 67, at para. 18.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even if the sentencing judge had erred as argued, the alleged error had
    no impact on sentence which was entirely fit and there is no basis for appellate
    intervention: <em>R. v. Lacasse</em>, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at para. 44.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, there is no issue that the sentence is well within the appropriate
    range of 21 months to four years in cases of sexual assault involving forced
    intercourse with a spouse or former spouse, as identified by this court in <em>R.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Smith</em>,
    [2011] O.J. No. 3832 (C.A.), at para. 87. Moreover, there were numerous other aggravating
    features of the offences that amply justified the three-year custodial sentence
    for sexual assault. These included: the appellant’s planning and deliberation of
    the entire scenario by reserving the motel room and bringing what appeared to
    be bullets and a firearm; his trickery and luring that breached the trust
    relationship with his estranged wife; his confinement of her and threats of physicality
    if she attempted to leave; and his sexual assault of a former domestic partner.
    The sentencing judge properly considered and applied the appropriate sentencing
    principles and reasonably balanced the aggravating and mitigating factors,
    including the appellant’s guilty plea.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the sentencing judge’s determination of four months of enhanced credit
    for the harsh conditions of the appellant’s detention, we see no error in the exercise
    of his discretion. As this court most recently reiterated in <em>R.&nbsp;v. Brown</em>,
    2020 ONCA 196, at para. 13, it is well-established that the amount of enhanced
    credit granted engages the sentencing judge’s discretion<span style='line-height:
200%;font-family:&quot;Verdana&quot;,sans-serif;color:#373739;background:white'>.</span> It
    is not subject to any rigid formula or calculus. The sentencing judge thoroughly
    considered the relevant circumstances and his decision was reasonable and not
    demonstrably unfit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duty
    counsel submitted that if this court rejects this ground of appeal,
    consideration should nevertheless be given to facilitate the appellant’s early
    release because of the risks that the appellant runs while incarcerated during
    the COVID-19 pandemic. The appellant’s statutory release date is in October
    2020.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    cannot intervene. Whether or not the appellant should be granted early parole
    because of COVID-19 considerations is a matter strictly within the jurisdiction
    of the Parole Board. While he remains in custody, the primary responsibility
    for his welfare and safety lies with the federal government and Corrections
    Canada.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    with respect to the probationary order, the appellant has not pointed to any
    error in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion that would permit
    appellate intervention.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    find no basis to interfere with the appellant’s sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
