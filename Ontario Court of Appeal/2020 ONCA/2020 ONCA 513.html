  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of breaking and
    entering, voyeurism, and criminal harassment of the complainant, with whom he
    had an intimate relationship. The complainant ended the relationship after two
    years and the appellant did not take the breakup well. The appellant sent the
    complainant so many emails and text messages that in November 2016, the
    complainant went to the police to complain about the unwanted contact.
    Thereafter, she began to receive emails and text messages from unknown
    addresses that she believed originated from the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Around this time, in November 2016, the
    complainant discovered that the passwords to both her Apple ID and her Facebook
    page had been changed. She also received a notification that her Apple ID had
    been used to log on to a new device. She testified that in November and
    December, she noted many times on returning home that her garage light was on
    or her door was not locked. Additionally, someone set up fake (and derogatory)
    dating profiles in the complainant’s name on a dating website. Derogatory email
    and text messages about the complainant were sent to her employer. In January
    2017, the principal of the complainant’s children’s school was sent photos of
    the complainant, along with allegations of misbehaviour on her part.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 28, the complainant awoke to find
    her cell phone on the floor, rather than the bedside table where she had left
    it. The passcode had been changed. She found her front door unlocked and a key
    left on a table. She concluded that someone had been in her home while she was
    asleep. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two days later, she noticed a Ring camera on the
    floor in her bedroom, pointed at her bed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police arrested the appellant and searched
    his cell phone incidental to arrest. A forensic search of the cell phone and
    his computer revealed several images that almost certainly originated from
    within the complainant’s residence. Some of the images were of documents kept
    in the complainant’s wallet, such as credit cards and a business card she
    received from the Halton Regional Police Service after making a complaint about
    the appellant. One image was of the complainant’s cordless phone, apparently
    displaying a call incoming at 12:01 A.M. on November 22. The time displayed on
    the phone matches the time and date of the image of the phone found on the
    appellant’s cell phone.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The cell phone and computer extractions also
    revealed nude photographs of the complainant taken in her bedroom. Both the
    angle of the photographs and the Ring watermark suggest they were taken from
    the Ring camera the complainant discovered on her bedroom floor. The
    complainant testified that she had never shared nude photos of herself with the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The extraction report also showed that on
    December 28, 2016 – the day which the complainant claimed someone had entered
    her residence and changed the passcode on her cell phone – the appellant’s cell
    phone received a notification that the complainant’s cell phone was now sharing
    its location with the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Also located on the appellant’s cell phone were
    notes that the appellant had written recording his feelings about the
    complainant and the break-up, complaining of her treatment of him and wondering
    “is this some kind of sick game? Are you okay? Who treats people like this, who
    can me (sic) so morally corrupt and still not think they’ve done anything
    wrong??”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of criminal
    harassment, voyeurism for a sexual purpose, and two counts of break and enter.
    He was sentenced to 12 months’ custody less 6 months’ credit for pre-sentence
    custody and time spent on restrictive bail.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant advances three grounds of appeal
    against conviction: (1) the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had
    animus towards the complainant, and this animus supported a finding that the
    appellant was the person who committed the acts of criminal harassment; (2) the
    trial judge failed to make a finding that the complainant was fearful of the
    appellant, which is a necessary element of criminal harassment; and (3) the
    trial judge erred by convicting the appellant on circumstantial evidence when
    the evidence was open to reasonable inferences other than the appellant’s guilt: <em>R. v. Villaroman</em>, 2016 SCC 33, at para. 35.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the argument concerning animus, there
    is ample evidence from which the trial judge was able to draw the inference
    that the appellant had animus towards the complainant. In particular, the notes
    that were recovered from his devices did not simply record his sorrow and
    self-pity. Some, at least, were directed at the complainant and were accusatory
    in nature, suggesting not only that he was a victim of her unjust treatment,
    but that she was both morally and psychologically disordered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the second ground of appeal, it
    is true that the trial judge did not make an explicit finding that the
    complainant was fearful of the appellant. She may not have been fearful during
    the initial period in which the appellant was continually messaging her.
    However, the record clearly establishes that she was fearful after discovering
    the Ring camera. The words she used to describe her reaction were “shocked”,
    “petrified”, “anxious”, “upset”, and “violated”. This was before she learned of
    the nude photographs of herself on the appellant’s devices.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant argued that as the
    evidence was circumstantial in nature, and there were other explanations for
    the evidence equally consistent with the guilt of the appellant, he ought to
    have been acquitted. In his oral submissions, he pressed that it was much more
    likely that the complainant had fabricated the evidence – including the
    apparently surreptitious nude photographs in the bedroom – that was downloaded
    to his devices without his knowledge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree that the trial judge made any
    error. The circumstantial evidence against the appellant was overwhelming. Neither
    was there an evidentiary gap that could have left the trial judge with a
    reasonable doubt. In these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to
    conclude that the only reasonable inference available was the appellant’s
    guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s strongest argument on the
    evidence is that some of the images found on his devices pre-date the two
    specific dates of the two counts of break and enter for which he was convicted.
    There is nothing to this. The information covers a period of time from October
    1, 2016 for the voyeurism offences, and November 2, 2016 for other offences.
    They are not tied to the dates particularized for the two counts of breaking
    and entering. The two counts of breaking and entering do not preclude the
    drawing of the inference that the appellant had been unlawfully present in the
    complainant’s residence on other occasions, which inference is also supported
    by the evidence at trial.</span></p>
