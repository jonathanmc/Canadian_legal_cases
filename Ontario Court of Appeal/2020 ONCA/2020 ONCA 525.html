    2015. On July 24, 2015, the children were returned to the mother's care

lang=EN>Timely resolution is also important. Appeals significantly delay
    permanent placements such that, absent a close relationship to the child from
    the child’s perspective, an appeal is generally not in the child’s best
    interests. The Act refers at ss. 1 and 3 to a child’s “need for stable
    relationships within a family” and the desirability of “permanent plans”. The
    need for timely resolution is also reflected in the prohibition against orders
    that will result in a child over 6 remaining in the temporary care and custody
    of a society for a period exceeding 24 months: s.&nbsp;122(1)(b).</span></p>

    intervention under this Part, has demonstrated a settled intention to treat the

    status at an earlier proceeding does not necessarily entitle a person to
    appeal. Rather, standing to appeal to the Superior Court of Justice under
    s.121(1) of the Act should be explicitly assessed at the time of the appeal to

    unwanted chaos and conflict that the mother inflicted on them”, by allowing R.’s
    mother to visit without Society oversight against the terms of various court
    orders. These 2016 visits had traumatic consequences for C. On one occasion, R.’s
