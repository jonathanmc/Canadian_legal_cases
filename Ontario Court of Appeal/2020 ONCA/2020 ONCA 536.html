    reasons reported at 2018 ONSC 7523.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Jamal J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Parliamentary privilege has been part of
    Canadian constitutional law since Confederation. The privilege, which is
    enjoyed by the Senate, the House of Commons, and the provincial legislative
    assemblies, helps maintain the constitutional separation of powers between the legislative,
    executive, and judicial branches of government and thus promotes the
    “constitutional equilibrium” of Canada’s democracy: <em>Canada (House of
    Commons) v. Vaid</em>, 2005 SCC 30, [2005] S.C.R. 667, at para. 4.
    Parliamentary privilege does this by shielding certain areas of legislative
    activity from judicial or executive review, thereby giving “the legislative
    branch of government the autonomy it requires to perform its constitutional
    functions”: <em>Chagnon v. Syndicat de la fonction publique et parapublique du
    Québec</em></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, 2018 SCC 39,
    [2018] 2 S.C.R. 687, at para. 1. When parliamentary privilege applies, it deprives
    the courts of jurisdiction over the privileged matter and confers an immunity from
    civil claims: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Vaid</span></em><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>, at para. 4; </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Chagnon</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, at para. 19.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue in this appeal is whether parliamentary
    privilege deprives the courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate a civil claim for
    damages brought by the appellant, Senator Michael Duffy, against the respondent,
    the Senate of Canada.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Senator Duffy’s claim alleges
    that the Senate </span><span lang=EN-CA>acted unlawfully in how it
    investigated, prosecuted, and suspended him from the Senate for allegedly claiming
    inappropriate expenses as a senator and by then accepting funds from the Prime
    Minister’s Chief of Staff, Mr. Nigel Wright, to reimburse the Senate for those
    expenses. Senator Duffy was later charged criminally and tried for fraud,
    breach of trust, and accepting a bribe, but was acquitted by the Ontario Court
    of Justice. Senator Duffy alleges that representatives from the Prime
    Minister’s Office (“PMO”) and individual senators interfered with the Senate’s
    investigation into his expenses for improper and purely political purposes.
    This, he says, led to the Senate’s decisions to suspend him, to deny him income
    and other benefits he says he was entitled to as a senator, and to refer matters
    to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (“RCMP”) for criminal investigation. Senator
    Duffy also alleges that the Attorney General of Canada is liable for wrongs
    committed by the RCMP in negligently investigating and wrongly laying criminal
    charges against him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge granted the Senate’s motion to
    dismiss the action as against it for lack of jurisdiction based on parliamentary
    privilege. She held that four established categories of parliamentary privilege
    apply: the Senate’s parliamentary privileges to discipline its members and
    administer its internal affairs, and its privileges over parliamentary
    proceedings and freedom of speech. Senator Duffy now appeals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>For the reasons that </span><span
lang=EN-CA>follow, I would dismiss the appeal. Like the motion judge, I
    conclude that Senator Duffy’s claims against the Senate trench on matters that
    fall within the scope of the Senate’s established parliamentary privileges. The
    courts therefore lack jurisdiction to adjudicate these claims. These matters
    fall within the exclusive competence of the Senate to adjudge according to its own
    rules. This conclusion respects the separation of powers between the courts and
    the legislative branch of government and provides the Senate with the autonomy
    it needs to discharge its constitutional role in our democracy.</span></p>

    concerns the Senate’s motion to dismiss or strike out the claims as against it
    for want of jurisdiction. In the proceedings below, the Attorney General of
    Canada did not move to dismiss <span style='color:black'>or strike the claims as
    against it.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Senator Duffy’s amended statement of claim makes
    the following allegations against the Senate, which for the purposes of the
    motion before the motion judge and the appeal before this court are assumed to
    be true:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In January 2009, Michael Duffy was appointed as
    a senator for Prince Edward Island (“PEI”), where he was born, has deep roots,
    and owned a property. <span style='color:black'>At the time, the Prime Minister’s
    Chief of Staff </span>and Senator Tkachuk, then Vice-Chair of the Senate
    Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration (the
    “CIBA”), assured Senator Duffy that it was appropriate for him to claim <em>per
    diem</em> expenses while living at his home in Ottawa, where he had lived
    throughout his almost 40-year career in journalism. This was because his PEI
    residence was his residence in the province for which he was appointed, while
    his home in Ottawa was his residence while attending to his duties at the Senate.
    Senator Duffy therefore claimed and received <em>per diem</em> expenses.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In February 2013, shortly after the media <span
style='color:black'>began scrutinizing </span>Senate expense issues, the CIBA engaged
    Deloitte, an audit, consulting, and financial advisory firm, to independently
    examine Senator Duffy’s expenses.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In late February 2013, the PMO learned that the
    Senate was looking for Senator Duffy to repay about $90,000 in expenses. Because
    of threats and pressure from the PMO, Senator Duffy agreed to repay the Senate,
    even though he insisted that his expenses were appropriate. As part of a political
    damage control strategy, the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff agreed to cover
    this amount personally. In late March 2013, Mr. Wright gave Senator Duffy’s
    lawyer a cheque for $90,000.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2013, Deloitte reported that the Senate’s
    rules for expenses were not clear. Besides one clerical error, Deloitte did not
    find any of Senator Duffy’s expenses were inappropriate. On receiving Deloitte’s
    report, the CIBA presented its own report (the “Twenty-Second Report”) to the
    Senate recommending that Senator Duffy’s expenses were proper. The Senate
    adopted the Twenty-Second Report.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In mid-May 2013, the media reported that Mr.
    Wright had written a personal cheque to cover Senator Duffy’s expenses. Mr.
    Wright then resigned as the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In late May 2013, on orders from the PMO, the
    CIBA released a new, politically motivated report (the “Twenty-Sixth Report”), which
    now alleged that Senator Duffy’s expenses were improper. It also referred the
    legality of the $90,000 repayment to the RCMP for investigation.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In October 2013, the Leader of the Government in
    the Senate introduced a motion to suspend Senator Duffy for “gross negligence”
    in the management of his parliamentary resources. The motion also provided
    that, during his suspension, the Senate should deny Senator Duffy all benefits,
    including remuneration and reimbursement of expenses, payment of sessional and
    living allowances, pension accrual, and access to all other Senate resources.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 5, 2013, the Senate voted to suspend
    Senator Duffy from the Senate for gross negligence, without an independent and
    impartial hearing, without procedural fairness, and in breach of the principles
    of natural justice and the presumption of innocence. Senator Duffy was the only
    senator suspended, even though the Auditor General of Canada later reported
    that 30 senators (not including Senator Duffy) had claimed improper expenses, none
    of whom was accused of gross negligence, suspended, or denied any of the
    benefits denied to Senator Duffy during his suspension.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On July 17, 2014, the RCMP charged Senator Duffy
    with 31 offences relating to his Senate expenses and his receipt of the $90,000
    cheque from Mr. Wright.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 2, 2015, Parliament was dissolved,
    automatically ending Senator Duffy’s suspension from the Senate. Senator Duffy

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 21, 2016, Vaillancourt J. of the
    Ontario Court of Justice acquitted Senator Duffy of all criminal charges: <em>R.
    v. Duffy</em>, 2016 ONCJ 220. He concluded that Senator Duffy “committed no
    prohibited act, violated no Senate rules and did not in all the circumstances
    commit the <em>actus reus</em> of fraud”: at para. 848. He also found that Mr.
    Wright had ordered “senior members of the Senate around as if they were pawns
    on a chessboard”, and that “those same senior members of the Senate [were]
    meekly acquiescing to Mr. Wright’s orders”: at paras. 1030-1031. Vaillancourt
    J. stated that “[t]he political, covert, relentless, unfolding of events is
    mindboggling and shocking”, and that in his view the “plotting” could “only be
    described as unacceptable”: at paras. 1036, 1038.</span></p>

    claw back $17,000 from Senator Duffy’s salary to recover funds it alleged he
    had inappropriately claimed as Senate expenses, even though Vaillancourt J. had
    found these expenses were proper.</span></p>

    reimbursement policy, the CIBA rejected Senator Duffy’s request for partial
    reimbursement of legal expenses and disbursements incurred in successfully defending
    the criminal charges. Later, the Senate also denied Senator Duffy’s request for
    reimbursement of his salary, living allowances, and pension accruals withheld
    while he was suspended from the Senate.</span></p>

    majority of the Supreme Court in <em>Chagnon</em> did not change the Court’s
    earlier holding in <em>Vaid</em> that the necessity of established privileges of
    the federal Parliament need not be proved again each time they are invoked, even
    if a party alleges an infringement of their <em>Charter</em> rights: at paras. 33-38.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge held that the Senate’s impugned

    its internal affairs (at paras. 64-88), (3) over parliamentary proceedings (at

    parliamentary privilege when the CIBA referred Senator Duffy’s acceptance of
    money from Mr. Wright to the RCMP and cooperated with the criminal
    investigation against him. She noted that the amended statement of claim did
    not explicitly allege waiver, and ruled that because parliamentary privilege is
    a constitutional principle, it cannot be waived implicitly. She held that
    Senator Duffy’s pleading alleged no conduct that clearly and unambiguously
    suggested that the Senate had waived its privilege: at paras. 109-114.</span></p>

    lawfulness or fairness”: at para. 119. She also held that because Senator Duffy
    could not assert any of his claims as against the Senate without relying on
    privileged speech, it was appropriate to refuse leave to amend the claim: at
    para. 120. She therefore dismissed Senator Duffy’s action as against the Senate:

    privilege in issue, parliamentary privilege cannot apply because he has alleged
    that certain senators and the CIBA acted at the unlawful and potentially
    criminal behest of the PMO. He says that this allegation is supported by the
    findings of Vaillancourt J. at his criminal trial. As Senator Duffy’s counsel stated
    in oral argument, the allegation is that the CIBA and certain senators followed
    the PMO’s bidding in “lock step”, like “marching soldiers”.</span></p>

    fundamental to the rule of law that the courts must be able to review state
    conduct for illegality, including illegal conduct within the Senate. He says that
    the motion judge’s most significant error was her conclusion that parliamentary
    privilege “precludes any court from determining whether [the Senate’s]
    decisions were unlawful”: at para. 88. In oral argument, Senator Duffy’s
    counsel stated <span style='color:black'>that </span>this finding “defies the notion
    of the paramountcy of constitutional principles, which include the rule of
    law”. He says that the court’s responsibility to uphold the rule of law is <em>logically

    privilege invoked by the Senate.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, as a factual matter, I note that while
    Vaillancourt J. described some of the conduct from within the PMO as
    “unacceptable” and “driven by deceit”, he made no findings of criminality
    against anyone inside the PMO or Senate, because those persons were not on
    trial: <em>R. v. Duffy</em>, 2016 ONCJ 220, at paras. 1038, 1239.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Arguably, however, the amended statement of
    claim does allege criminality. It claims that Senator Duffy was “extorted” into
    agreeing to release a statement <span style='color:black'>that </span>he had
    claimed amounts in error and that he would pay the amounts back: at para. 36.
    Elsewhere, the claim alleges illegality that falls short of criminality: it pleads
    that the “actions of Nigel Wright and the PMO were mindboggling and shocking” and
    the actions of the <span style='color:black'>Senate and certain senators were
    “unlawful”, but only </span>“in the administrative law sense”: at paras. 88,
    108.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Senator Duffy’s argument that parliamentary privilege does not protect criminal
    conduct within the Senate is cast too broadly. When framed more precisely, the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The argument is framed too broadly because nobody
    disputes that parliamentarians can commit crimes within Parliament and that parliamentary
    privilege would not necessarily protect them from criminal prosecution. Indeed,
    this point is confirmed by the prosecution and acquittal of Senator Duffy for alleged
    criminal conduct. Maingot summarizes the Canadian position as follows, at p.109:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Members of Parliament are amenable to the
    criminal law except <span style='color:black'>in respect of </span>words spoken
    or acts done in the transaction of parliamentary business. While a Member of
    either House may participate in debate with irrelevant remarks and defamatory
    libel, it is difficult to envisage a criminal act that would fit into or be
    part of a parliamentary proceeding. Thus, there is “no authority for the
    proposition that an ordinary crime committed in the House of Commons would be
    withdrawn from the ordinary course of criminal justice” [quoting <em>Bradlaugh
    v. Gossett</em> (1884), 12 Q.B.D. 271]. Such act in question would, while not
    part of a “proceeding in Parliament”, have an aspect of contempt of Parliament <span

    criminal aspect would be dealt with by the courts. [Footnotes omitted.]</span></p>

    citing approvingly <em>R. v.</em> <em>Bunting</em> (1885), 7 O.R. 524 (H.C. (Q.B.
    Div.)), which accepted that a conspiracy to change the government by bribing
    members of a provincial legislature can be prosecuted criminally. Binnie J.
    stated, at para. 43:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A]s stated in <em>Erskine May</em> (19th ed.

    Particular words or acts may be entirely unrelated to any business which is in
    course of transaction, or is in a more general sense before the House as having
    been ordered to come before it in due course” […] Thus in <em>R. v. Bunting</em> (1885), 7 O.R. 524, for example, the Queen’s Bench Division held that a
    conspiracy to bring about a change in the government by bribing members of the
    provincial legislature was not <span style='color:black'>in any way </span>connected
    with a proceeding in Parliament and, therefore, the court had jurisdiction to

    the U.K. Supreme Court in <em>R. v. Chaytor</em>, [2010] UKSC 52, which held
    that parliamentary privilege did not deprive the criminal courts of jurisdiction
    to try former members of Parliament on charges of false accounting of
    parliamentary expenses. In reasons concurred with by <span style='color:black'>a
    majority of the </span>Court, Lord Rodger explained that the common law has
    long accepted that <em>prima facie</em> a member of Parliament can be
    prosecuted before the courts for an “ordinary crime” committed in the House of
    Commons, such as stealing money from the till in the Members’ Dining Room: at
    para. 121. He noted, at para. 113, that the expression “ordinary crime”
    appeared in the judgment of Stephen J. in <em>Bradlaugh v. Gossett</em> (1884),
    12 Q.B.D. 271, at p. 283, in which he said: “I know of no authority for the
    proposition that an ordinary crime committed in the House of Commons would be
    withdrawn from the ordinary course of criminal justice.” Lord Rodger added that,
    by contrast, a member could not be prosecuted for a crime such as sedition for saying
    something during debates in the House, because this would be protected by the
    parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech: at para. 113. The distinction between
    what can and cannot be prosecuted under the criminal law, he explained, turns
    on whether raising the issue in the ordinary courts would call into question
    decisions taken by the House or one of its committees on a matter intended to
    be under the exclusive cognizance of the House and its committees: at para.
    120.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In view of these authorities, the issue Senator
    Duffy raises must be framed more precisely. The issue is not whether Senator
    Duffy has alleged criminal conduct in the Senate. The issue is whether he has alleged
    an “ordinary crime” in the Senate. Has he impugned conduct connected with a
    proceeding in Parliament? And would raising these issues in the ordinary courts
    call into question decisions taken by the Senate and its committees on matters
    intended to be under the exclusive cognizance of the Senate and its committees?</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The conduct that Senator Duffy impugns here is
    not an “ordinary crime”, such as theft. The alleged unlawful or potentially criminal
    interference by the PMO with the CIBA and the decisions of the Senate are integrally
    connected with proceedings in Parliament – the Senate’s investigation,
    deliberations, and decisions regarding Senator Duffy’s expenses and benefits as
    a senator. Raising these issues before the courts would unavoidably call into
    question the disciplinary and internal decisions taken by the Senate and the
    CIBA on matters that ordinarily fall within established categories of
    parliamentary privilege.</span></p>

    that Parliament should be prorogued for five of the eight weeks just before the
    “Brexit” date of October 31, 2019, when the U.K. was scheduled to leave the
    European Union, was unlawful. The Court stated that “the Prime Minister’s action
    had the effect of frustrating or preventing the constitutional role of
    Parliament in holding the Government to account”: at para.&nbsp;55. The Court
    also rejected the argument that parliamentary privilege prevented the courts
    from considering the validity of the prorogation itself. It held that
    prorogation is not a “proceeding in Parliament”, because it is not part of the
    “core or essential business of Parliament”, but rather “brings that core or
    essential business of Parliament to an end”: at para. 68. <em>Miller</em> thus concerns
    the justiciability and legality of the exercise of the prerogative power to order
    a prorogation of Parliament, “a power recognised by the common law and
    exercised by the Crown”: at para. 30. I make no comment on whether courts in
    Canada would take a similar approach in reviewing the legality of prorogation based
    on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada. However, <em>Miller</em> offers

    is different at each level:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he framers of the <em>Constitution Act,

    precedent), it ought to be accepted by a Canadian court <span style='color:

    contrasts with the situation in the provinces where legislated privilege, <span

    authoritatively established by British or Canadian precedent – applies to parliamentary
    privilege at the federal level but not to legislated parliamentary privilege at
    the provincial level because s. 18 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> authorizes Parliament to enact laws defining the privileges of the Senate and
    the House of Commons. Parliament has done so through s. 4 of the <em>Parliament
    of Canada Act</em> by defining those privileges by reference to the privileges
    of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. There is thus no need to inquire
    into the necessity of federal parliamentary privileges – the “main body” of which
    are legislated – because the constitutional status of those privileges has been
    put beyond question by express constitutional and legislative enactments in s.
    18 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> and s. 4 of the <em>Parliament of
    Canada Act</em>: <em>Vaid</em>, at para. 36. This is not true of legislated parliamentary
    privileges at the provincial level, which would likely have to meet the necessity
    test.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Binnie J. also explained in <em>Vaid </em>that inherent
    parliamentary privileges at the provincial level must <em>always</em> meet the
    necessity test, at para. 29(6):</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When the existence of a category (or sphere of
    activity) for which inherent privilege is claimed (<i>at least at the
    provincial level</i>) is put in issue, the court must not only look at the
    historical roots of the claim but also to determine whether the category of
    inherent privilege <u>continues</u> to be necessary to the functioning of the
    legislative body today. Parliamentary history, while highly relevant, is not
    conclusive. [Underlining in original; italics added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>Lastly, while Binnie J. </span><span lang=EN-CA>left
    open the possibility that certain inherent or legislated privileges at the
    federal level “would fall to be assessed under the ‘necessity’ test defined by
    the exigencies and circumstances of our own Parliament”, he stated that “[t]his
    point would have to be explored if and when it arises for decision”: <em>Vaid</em>,
    at para. 38.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>To summarize the direction from <em>Vaid</em>: (1) at the federal
    level, the two-step approach applies to both legislated and inherent parliamentary
    privilege; (2) at the provincial level, inherent parliamentary privilege must always
    meet the necessity test, while a legislated parliamentary privilege would
    likely have to do so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Like the Federal Court of Appeal in <em>Boulerice</em>, at para. 74,
    I do not read <em>Chagnon</em> as having displaced “the orthodoxy in <em>Vaid</em> that when a legislated parliamentary privilege is shown to fit within an
    established category, necessity cannot be revisited”. I say this for two
    reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, <em>Chagnon</em> addressed provincial rather than federal parliamentary
    privilege. The Court’s focus was therefore on establishing the necessity of the
    inherent provincial privilege claimed to dismiss the security guards employed
    by the National Assembly of Qu</span><span lang=EN-CA>é</span><span lang=EN-CA>bec,
    a privilege that the Court held had not been established: <em>Chagnon</em>, at
    para. 4; see also <em>Boulerice</em>, at para. 72.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, nothing in <em>Chagnon</em> suggests or even hints that the
    Supreme Court intended to overrule <em>Vaid</em> by eliminating the first step
    of <em>Vaid</em>’s two-step approach to federal parliamentary privilege. <em>Chagnon</em> addressed only the scope of the inherent provincial parliamentary privilege of
    the National Assembly of Qu</span><span lang=EN-CA>é</span><span lang=EN-CA>bec:
    at paras. 16, 43-44 and 56.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would therefore reject Senator Duffy’s argument that the motion
    judge erred by not addressing the necessity of the four categories of
    parliamentary privilege invoked by the Senate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In any event, if it were necessary to decide the point, I would
    conclude that <span style='color:black'>each of these four categories </span>of
    parliamentary privilege continues to meet the necessity test. The established privileges
    of discipline of members, control over internal affairs and parliamentary
    proceedings, and freedom of speech are all deeply rooted in the history of
    parliamentary privilege. Each privilege helps preserve the Senate’s
    independence and promotes the workings of representative democracy. They allow
    the Senate to proceed fearlessly and without outside interference in
    discharging its constitutional role in “enacting legislation and acting as a
    check on executive power”: <em>Chagnon</em>, at para. 23; <em>New Brunswick
    Broadcasting</em>, at p. 354; and <em>Vaid</em>, at paras. 21, 41. If the
    courts could be asked to adjudicate the Senate’s day-to-day administration of
    these matters, the Senate’s autonomy as a legislative body and its freedom to
    do its legislative work with “dignity and efficiency” would be undermined: see <em>Chagnon</em>,
    at para. 23; <em>Vaid</em>, at paras. 29(4)-(8); and <em>Boulerice</em>, at
    paras. 123-126.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would therefore reject Senator Duffy’s third ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the motion judge err by failing to reconcile
    the Senate’s parliamentary privilege with the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Senator Duffy’s fourth ground of appeal asserts that the motion
    judge erred in stating that because the Senate’s impugned actions are protected
    by parliamentary privilege, she could not give “any consideration” to whether those
    actions “were … contrary to Senator Duffy’s <em>Charter</em> rights”: at para.
    14.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not accept this argument. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held
    that where parliamentary privilege applies, the legislative body holding the privilege
    has the exclusive competence to adjudicate an alleged breach of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>For example, in <em>Vaid</em>, Binnie J. stated, at para. 30:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>One part of the Constitution cannot abrogate
    another part of the Constitution <i>(<em>Reference re Bill 30, An Act to Amend

    Broadcasting</em>, at pp. 373 and 390. <u>In matters of privilege, it would lie
    within the exclusive competence of the legislative assembly itself to consider
    compliance with human rights and civil liberties. The House, “with one voice,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>More recently, in <em>Chagnon</em>, Karakatsanis J. stated, at para.
    24:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Judicial review <span style='color:black'>of

lang=EN-CA>Because I conclude that parliamentary privilege applies to the

lang=EN-CA>Senator Duffy’s final ground of appeal asserts that the Senate,

    factum contends that “[g]iven that [the] CIBA referred the matter to the RCMP

    waived its privilege over the subject matter at issue in this proceeding”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>The motion judge cited caselaw accepting that parliamentary
    privilege can be waived by Parliament itself, but concluded that because
    parliamentary privilege is a constitutional principle it requires an express
    waiver by Parliament and cannot be waived implicitly: at paras. 111-113, citing <em>Rothmans</em>, at para. 35 and <em>Canada (Deputy Commissioner, Royal
    Canadian Mounted Police) v. Canada (Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted
    Police)</em>, 2007 FC 564, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 752, at para. 81. The motion judge found
    “no conduct alleged in the statement of claim that would indicate, clearly and
    unambiguously, that the Senate waived its privilege”: at para. 114.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>A rare example of Parliament purporting to expressly waive parliamentary
    privilege was referred to in <em>R. v. Connolly</em> (1891), 22 O.R. 220 (H.C.

    Minister of Justice, passed a resolution permitting evidence given by witnesses
    who testified before a parliamentary committee to be used in criminal
    prosecutions against them: see also Maingot, at pp. 109-110; <em>Rothmans</em>,

lang=EN-CA>l C.J. mooted whether, as a matter of constitutional principle, parliamentary
    privilege can ever be waived:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Arguably, a privilege which ensures the
    independence of the House in performing core legislative functions cannot be
    waived by Parliament as doing so would undermine the very principle on which

lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In <em>Boulerice</em>,<em> </em>the Federal Court of Appeal did not resolve
    this question because it concluded that nothing in the legislation in the case

    privileges: at para. 130.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Support for the issue mooted in <em>Boulerice</em> might be found in
    the remarks of McLachlin J. in <em>New Brunswick Broadcasting</em>, at p. 379,
    when she noted that parliamentary privileges “must be held <u>absolutely</u> and constitutionally if they are to be effective” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>On the other hand, it could be argued that </span><span
lang=EN-CA>because s. 18 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1867</em> gives
    Parliament the legislative authority to “define” the Senate’s parliamentary
    privileges through federal legislation, it could choose to define its
    privileges more narrowly, such as by waiving its privilege in a particular
    case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Even if parliamentary privilege can be waived – which I believe need
    not be decided in this case – I would conclude that because of the institutional
    and constitutional character of parliamentary privilege, any waiver would require
    an express statement, either in legislation or possibly in a parliamentary resolution,
    that clearly and unambiguously waives the privilege.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I agree with the motion judge that Senator Duffy’s amended statement
    of claim pleads no express, clear, and unambiguous waiver by the Senate of its
    parliamentary privilege. I would also find that merely referring the matter to
    the RCMP for criminal investigation in this case would not meet the required
    standard for waiver of parliamentary privilege. The Senate should be able to refer
    matters to the appropriate authorities for criminal investigation without fear
    that doing so will jeopardize its constitutional independence from the other
    branches of government.</span></p>
