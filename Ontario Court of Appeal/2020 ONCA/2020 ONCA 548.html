    Justice, sitting with a jury.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>B.W.
    Miller J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 20, 2011, Ms. Tania Whilby landed at
    Toronto Pearson International Airport with 1.4 kilograms of cocaine hidden in
    her suitcase. A jury found Ms. Whilby guilty of importing cocaine, contrary to s.
    6(1) of the <em>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c. 19, on
    October 18, 2012. She was sentenced on January 21, 2013 to two years’ less a
    day imprisonment, to be served conditionally.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prosecuted separately, the three appellants were
    found guilty by a jury of importing cocaine and conspiracy to import cocaine
    into Canada. The Crown alleged that Mr. Robert Gardener coordinated Ms.
    Whilby’s travel to and from Jamaica, where she received the cocaine, and that
    Mr. Dwayne McFarlane and Ms. Priscilla Bekoe provided Ms. Whilby with her plane
    ticket and drove her to the airport in Toronto at the beginning of her trip.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Whilby was the main witness in the
    prosecution of the appellants. In the days before her sentencing, she
    identified Ms. Bekoe and Mr. McFarlane from photo line-ups as the people who
    drove her to the airport, following failed identifications several months
    prior, before her trial had started. The Crown’s case against Mr. Gardener was
    based largely on text messages between him and Ms. Whilby over BlackBerry
    Messenger (“BBM”), in which he agreed to refer her to another person who would
    give her a plane ticket to Jamaica.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the appellants each argue that their
    verdicts are unreasonable, and they challenge various aspects of the trial
    judge’s charge to the jury, including that he gave an insufficient caution with
    respect to the evidence of Ms. Whilby, pursuant to <em>Vetrovec v. The Queen</em>,
    [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811, and that his instructions with respect to Ms. Whilby’s
    eyewitness identifications failed to focus the jury’s attention on the
    frailties of that evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeals. I would order that all appellants receive new trials on the basis of
    errors in the jury charge.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Alleged Drug Importation Scheme</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the Crown’s theory was that Mr.
    Gardener assisted Ms. Whilby in obtaining plane tickets to and from Jamaica by
    referring her to an intermediary. That intermediary, who contacted Ms. Whilby
    through a BBM profile called “Diggzz T dot”, was alleged to be Mr. McFarlane.
    On the day of Ms. Whilby’s flight to Jamaica, a man and a woman, alleged to be
    Mr. McFarlane and Ms. Bekoe, drove her to the airport in a black Cadillac. Ms.
    Bekoe also allegedly called Ms. Whilby while she was in Jamaica and told her to
    bring back alcohol and various food items for her. On Ms. Whilby’s evidence, she
    was given a suitcase in Jamaica to carry these items. On her return to Canada,
    the suitcase was found to contain the cocaine.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Whilby Receives a Plane Ticket to Jamaica</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Whilby testified that she was “friends with
    benefits” with Mr. Gardener, whom she knew by the alias Bliitsz. The two had met
    in person three times and communicated extensively on social media and BBM. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Whilby testified that she asked Mr. Gardener
    if he had a contact who could get her a plane ticket to Jamaica, where her
    boyfriend resided. She testified that Mr. Gardener said he could.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sections of Ms. Whilby’s BBM conversations with Bliitsz
    were introduced at trial. There was no serious dispute that Mr. Gardener was
    Bliitsz. Starting on Thursday, May 26, 2011, Ms. Whilby and Bliitsz spoke daily
    to discuss the status of the plane ticket. They discussed whether her flight
    would go to Kingston or Montego Bay, and at no point did Ms. Whilby or Mr.
    Gardener refer to the cost of the plane ticket or who would pay for it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On Tuesday, May 31, 2011, Ms. Whilby again asked
    Bliitsz for the status of the ticket. He responded that the ticket would come
    over the course of the week. The week came and went. Their final communication was
    on Monday, June 6, 2011, when Ms. Whilby pointed out that the week had ended,
    and Bliitsz responded with an emoji. The record contains no further
    communications between Ms. Whilby and Bliitsz related to the plane ticket.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One week later, on Monday, June 13, 2011, Ms. Whilby
    confirmed her travel details with a BBM contact named “Diggzz T dot”, as part
    of a conversation that was also introduced into evidence. Diggzz sent Ms.
    Whilby a picture of her travel itinerary, indicating roundtrip flights to
    Montego Bay. Her flight would depart the next day. He asked her if she had a
    criminal record, and when she said no, he responded, “K alright. Everything is
    good then, Ill text to later on tonight”. He told Ms. Whilby he would pick her
    up the next morning at 6:15 a.m. in a black Cadillac.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown alleged that Diggzz was Mr. McFarlane.
    Ms. Whilby testified that she came into contact with Diggzz through Mr.
    Gardener, but did not recall who initiated contact with whom on BBM. Ms. Whilby
    testified that Diggzz was Mr. McFarlane, but on cross-examination, she agreed
    that Diggzz could have been a woman.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the morning of June 14, 2011, Ms. Whilby
    provided directions for Diggzz to pick her up. He told Ms. Whilby that her
    luggage “can only way up to 100lbs all together”, and she responded that she
    only had two handbags. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Whilby testified that a man and a woman came
    to pick her up in a black Cadillac. She had never met the man who drove the car
    or the woman who was sitting in the passenger seat, and she did not recall hearing
    their names. Ms. Whilby testified that from her vantage point in the back seat,
    behind the passenger seat, she could only see the back and right side of the
    driver’s face. She testified that she never looked into his eyes, and he never
    exited the vehicle. The woman accompanied Ms. Whilby to check in at the airport
    while the man remained in the car. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown alleged that the driver was Mr.
    McFarlane and that the woman was Ms. Bekoe, based largely on eyewitness
    identification evidence from Ms. Whilby.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Initially, Ms. Whilby testified that she did not
    recall having conversations with the people in the car. Moments later, she
    testified that the woman told her a man named Ed would pick her up in Jamaica. She
    also testified that the driver provided her with her ticket, but then said it
    was the woman, after reviewing her preliminary inquiry testimony.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Whilby testified that while she was in
    Jamaica, she spoke with a woman over the phone and this woman requested that
    she bring “a few beverages and snacks” back to Toronto. The woman also told Ms.
    Whilby that she was flying to Jamaica “on Tuesday”. Ms. Whilby understood this
    woman to be the same woman who accompanied her to the airport in Toronto, based
    on “the nature of the conversation” and because she “recognized her voice”. In
    cross-examination, Ms. Whilby agreed that she believed it was the woman from
    the ride to the airport not because she recognized her voice, but because of
    the content of the conversation, as the woman asked about the flight and about
    Ed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Whilby testified that Ed, who drove her around
    Jamaica, gave her the suitcase that was eventually apprehended by customs
    officials in Toronto. Ms. Whilby packed the woman’s beverages and snacks into
    the suitcase. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When Ms. Whilby returned to Toronto, Diggzz sent
    her a message to coordinate pick-up at the airport. Ms. Whilby was apprehended
    shortly after her landing, when police found the cocaine hidden in a false
    bottom of her suitcase. After Ms. Whilby’s arrest, the RCMP seized her phone
    and used it to communicate with Diggzz, while posing as Ms. Whilby. The police
    never found Diggzz. </span></p>

    at para. 40. In this context, “acting judicially” means “not only acting
    dispassionately” but also “arriving at a conclusion that does not conflict with
    the bulk of judicial experience”: <em>Biniaris</em>, at para. 40. While the

    order to visit her boyfriend. She responded “no” when asked whether she was
    “curious at all that – about the fact that you didn’t have to pay for [the

    relied on inferences drawn from Mr. Gardener’s BBM messages with Ms. Whilby,
    and from Ms. Whilby’s BBM messages with Diggzz. A week after Ms. Whilby had
    been messaging with Mr. Gardener to get her a free ticket to Jamaica through an
    unnamed source, she messaged Diggzz to provide her with an image of her

    How did she know that a ticket for a flight leaving the next day had been
    issued in her name and that she should ask Diggzz for it? Who paid for the

    was the contact that Mr. Gardener had promised, that Mr. Gardener introduced
    them, that Ms. Whilby had to have known that she was given a free ticket for a
    criminal purpose, and that Mr. Gardener, having arranged for the ticket, must also

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The McFarlane Appeal</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. McFarlane argues that his guilty verdicts
    were unreasonable because the only evidence connecting him to the drug
    importation was Ms. Whilby’s testimony alleging that he was Diggzz and that he drove
    her to the airport on the day she flew to Jamaica. Given concerns over the
    reliability and credibility of Ms. Whilby’s testimony and in particular her
    eyewitness identification evidence, Mr. McFarlane contends that the probative
    value of that evidence was too weak to sustain his convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to her trial, Ms. Whilby failed to
    identify Mr. McFarlane in a photo line-up. Days before her sentencing, Ms.
    Whilby identified Mr. McFarlane from a photo line-up as the driver of the black
    Cadillac that took her to the airport. On the back of his photo, she wrote her
    basis for having identified him: “eyes – hair was little longer then – shape of
    face complexion of skin – Asian look”. The circumstances in which police
    conducted both line-ups are unknown, though Ms. Whilby’s evidence was that the
    first line-up took place in the back of a police car, where she reviewed each
    photo sequentially. There is no evidence of Ms. Whilby providing any prior
    description of Mr. McFarlane to the police. At the appellants’ trial, Ms.
    Whilby repeatedly identified Mr. McFarlane in the courtroom as both Diggzz and the
    driver.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination, Ms. Whilby testified that
    she and the driver of the black Cadillac never spoke. Moreover, she testified
    that she could only see the back and right side of the driver’s head, as she
    was sitting behind the passenger seat. She never saw his face from head-on or looked
    into his eyes, and she could not estimate his height as he had never left the

    conceded that the person communicating with her from the Diggzz account could
    have been a woman.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Without Ms. Whilby’s eyewitness identification,
    there would have been no case against Mr. McFarlane. There were, as counsel for
    Mr. McFarlane argued, difficulties with that evidence. Eyewitness
    identification evidence, in general, can pose a risk of wrongful conviction: <em>R.
    v. Tat</em> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481, at para. 99; <em>R. v. Miaponoose</em> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 445, at pp. 450-51. Eyewitness identification evidence
    is particularly suspect where the person identified is a stranger to the
    witness, where the circumstances of the identification are not conducive to an
    accurate identification, where pre-trial identification processes are flawed,
    and where there is no other evidence tending to confirm the identification
    evidence: <em>Tat</em>, at para. 100.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even setting aside the questions raised by the
    suspect timing of the successful photo line-up, immediately before sentencing,
    and having followed on from previous unsuccessful line-ups, there are
    difficulties raised by Ms. Whilby’s testimony. On Ms. Whilby’s testimony, the
    driver of the black Cadillac was a stranger and he did not introduce himself to
    her or speak to her. She never saw the front of his face or looked into his
    eyes – and yet she referred to these characteristics in explaining why she
    picked Mr. McFarlane out of the line-up. There is no evidence concerning the
    conduct of the pre-trial identification processes, other than that they occurred
    roughly 19 months after the drive to the airport, days before Ms. Whilby’s
    sentencing and following an unsuccessful line-up roughly nine months prior. Ms.
    Whilby gave no explanation for the sudden change in her ability to identify the
    driver. Other than Ms. Whilby’s testimony that Mr. McFarlane drove the black
    Cadillac and communicated with her under the Diggzz alias, there is no evidence
    linking Mr. McFarlane to the offences. </span></p>

    some, or none of a witness’s testimony. A jury was entitled to accept Ms.
    Whilby’s identification of Mr. McFarlane, and reject her testimony about the
    limits of her observations of, and interactions with the driver. A jury could
    reasonably have concluded that Ms. Whilby was significantly more familiar with
    Diggzz than she let on, and if that was the case, it would bolster her ability
    to identify him. The BBM messages between Ms. Whilby and Diggzz, particularly
    an exchange after Ms. Whilby arrived at Pearson airport and was waiting to
    board her flight, suggested a greater degree of familiarity than would be
    expected if Diggzz was the driver, as Ms. Whilby testified, and that they had
    no conversation on the way to the airport, as she also testified:</span></p>

    identified all three appellants in the days preceding her sentencing hearing. This

    evidence was subject to special scrutiny because she was convicted of bringing
    a suitcase containing cocaine into Canada, but maintained her innocence during
    the appellants’ trial. He also provided the following instruction in relation
    to her cooperation with the authorities: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Between her conviction and her sentencing,
    including on the day before her sentencing, Ms. Whilby met with RCMP Constable
    Dionne. In cross-examination, Ms. Whilby denied the suggestion that she made a
    deal with the police or the Crown that might lighten her sentence in exchange
    for her cooperation here. She admitted that she was sentenced to two years,
    less a day, served by house arrest. There is no evidence brought in this court
    about Ms. Whilby’s sentence other than her evidence. When cross-examined on
    this issue, Ms. Whilby did not admit that she received a lighter sentence in
    exchange for her cooperation. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I will caution you now about hearsay briefly
    and return to it later. Ms. Whilby was cross-examined on a typewritten version
    of an audio or video recording, it is unclear which, of her conversation with
    RCMP Constable Dionne the day before her sentencing. The audio or visual
    recording was not played to you. The portions of that interview that were put
    to her read aloud are not evidence of the truth of their contents. It was not
    put into evidence, and Officer Dionne did not testify as to the conversations
    that were put to Ms. Whilby in cross-examination. Remember, that evidence is
    that which comes from the witnesses, the exhibits, or admissions. The
    transcript of the conversation that was put to Ms. Whilby in cross-examination
    was put there for the purposes of testing her credibility. Ms. Whilby, in the
    witness box, did not agree with the statements or adopt them as correct. The
    only purpose to which you can put the cross-examinations is assessing Ms.
    Whilby’s credibility. In other words, use it to determine the extent to which
    you believe or rely on or accept her evidence. You may not accept what was
    reportedly said in that interview as being true.</span></p>

    that Ms. Whilby cooperated with the police and was led to believe that doing so
    would result in a lesser sentence. Instead, the instruction improperly
    discussed hearsay, focusing the jury’s attention on whether Ms. Whilby in fact

    sentencing. She denied that she did so to receive any benefit. However, in
    cross-examination, defence counsel put transcripts from Ms. Whilby’s police

    her cooperation with the authorities in the following terms:</span></p>

    the truth of its contents. It was immaterial whether the trial judge and trial
    Crown actually learned of Ms. Whilby’s cooperation with the authorities, or
    whether her cooperation actually resulted in a lesser sentence. The purpose of
    this section of Ms. Whilby’s cross-examination was to demonstrate that on the
    eve of her sentencing, Ms. Whilby had every reason to believe that she would
    benefit from cooperating with the authorities – even if doing so meant lying or
    identifying innocent suspects. </span></p>

    evidence by not recognizing that Ms. Whilby accepted that Constable Dionne had
    told her that the Crown and the Court would be aware that Ms. Whilby had helped
    the prosecution, and that this would hopefully help her in her sentencing . The
    hearsay aspect of the statement was irrelevant to the necessary <em>Vetrovec </em>caution,
    and the focus on hearsay, and the related failure to explain the significance
    of the statement being made detracted considerably from the trial judge’s
    obligation to explain to the jury which circumstances brought Ms. Whilby’s
    credibility into serious question. The instruction could only have generated confusion
    about whether Ms. Whilby’s motive to cooperate with the authorities was or was
    not a factor in weighing her credibility. The trial judge’s instruction
    distracted the jury from considering one of the main reasons why Ms. Whilby’s
    evidence was subject to special scrutiny. </span></p>

    that the convictions of all three appellants be quashed, and new trials ordered
    on all counts. The potential impact of the error on the identification of Ms.

    at issue with respect to Mr. Gardener, the <em>Vetrovec</em> error impacted him
    as well. Ms. Whilby’s testimony that Mr. Gardener introduced her to Diggzz was
    central to the case against Mr. Gardener. As noted above, deciding whether to believe

    the evidence that was potentially independent and confirmatory, such as photos

    in referring to the BBM conversations, as they were not independent of Ms.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, with respect to the independence of the
    evidence from Ms. Whilby, the appellants are correct that Ms. Whilby’s own
    messages as part of these conversations were not independent of her and thus
    could not have constituted confirmatory evidence: <em>Khela</em>, at para. 39.
    However, the trial judge gave specific instructions to this effect:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The statements made by Ms. Whilby in [the BBM
    conversations] cannot be confirmatory of her evidence in the witness box. They
    are her statements, notwithstanding that they are record[ed] on her Blackberry.
    They are not independent.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The statements by others may be taken as
    confirmatory if they support her evidence in the witness box if you find that
    they are untainted and independent. That is for you to decide. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When read in context, the trial judge’s focused
    instructions in respect of the BBM messages equipped the jury with the tools
    necessary to determine whether those messages were independent. The appellants
    argue that even the messages of others were tainted by Ms. Whilby, as only she
    could authenticate their contents. From my review of the trial transcripts,
    there was no suggestion that Ms. Whilby had fabricated any of the contents of
    the messages on her BBM. The messages she received from Mr. Gardener and Diggzz
    satisfied the criterion of independence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Second, with respect to the materiality
    criterion, the appellants argue that the evidence identified by the trial judge
    was not material as it did not go to identification, which was the main issue
    in the prosecution of Mr. McFarlane and Ms. Bekoe. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To be material, confirmatory evidence “must be
    capable of restoring the trier’s faith in <em>relevant </em>aspects of the
    witness’ account” (emphasis in original): <em>Khela</em>, at para. 43; <em>R.
    v. Kehler</em>, 2004 SCC 11, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 328, at para. 15. In <em>Kehler</em>,
    at para. 15, the Supreme Court explained that confirmatory evidence need not
    address only those parts of the witness’s testimony that are disputed in order
    to be material:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant wrongly equates “relevant” with
    “disputed”. Mr. Greenwood’s detailed account of the robbery, though undisputed,
    was no less “relevant” to the offences charged than his implication of the
    appellant in their commission. And while confirmatory evidence should be
    capable of restoring the trier’s faith in relevant aspects of the witness’s
    account, it hardly follows that the confirmatory evidence must, as a matter of
    law, implicate the accused where the only disputed issue at trial is whether
    the accused was a participant in the crimes alleged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge conveyed to the jury that the
    confirmatory evidence must “tend to show that [Tania] Whilby is telling the
    truth that any, some, or all of the three accused committed the offences with
    which they are charged”. The evidence must also “give you comfort that [Tania]
    Whilby can be trusted when she says that any, some, or all of these three
    people committed the offences with which they are charged”. This court has
    determined that similar formulations adequately conveyed to the jury the scope
    of the materiality criterion for confirmatory evidence: see <em>R. v. Saleh</em>,

    others that directly affected the reliability of Ms. Whilby’s evidence. In
    particular, Ms. Bekoe and Mr. McFarlane argue that the trial judge should have
    drawn the jury’s attention to the fact that Ms. Whilby failed to identify Ms.
    Bekoe and Mr. McFarlane from a line-up three times in one day 13 months after
    the drive to the airport, to the lack of evidence on whether Ms. Whilby had
    provided any descriptions of the appellants to the police before her ultimate
    identification days before her sentencing, and to the generality of her
    explanations for having identified the appellants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree. Much like the trial judge’s <em>Vetrovec</em> caution, his discussion of eyewitness identification effectively deprived the

lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jurisprudence has long recognized the

    283, at para. 19; <em>R. v. Hanemaayer</em>, 2008 ONCA 580, 234 C.C.C. (3d) 3,
    at para. 29. In most cases, the danger is an honest but inaccurate
    identification by a credible and confident witness: <em>R. v. Jack</em>, 2013
    ONCA 80, 294 C.C.C. (3d) 163, at para. 14; <em>R. v. Hibbert</em>, 2002 SCC 39,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 445, at para. 52. Trial judges enjoy significant discretion in
    crafting an appropriate caution, but where the evidence contains significant
    frailties, the trial judge must identify these specific frailties rather than
    rely upon boilerplate instructions: <em>R. v. Baltovich</em> (2004), 73 O.R.
    (3d) 481 (C.A.), at para. 78.</span></p>

    identification case. The danger was not only – or not primarily – that Ms.
    Whilby would honestly identify the wrong suspects, but that Ms. Whilby could
    not be trusted to identify anybody. This was very much a case that required a
    bespoke instruction on the specific frailties of Ms. Whilby’s eyewitness
    evidence. Instead, the jury received a lengthy caution that largely recited
    specimen jury instructions which raised factors that had no basis in the
    evidence, such as whether Ms. Whilby had compromised vision, or whether
    anything impaired her ability to observe the appellants, or whether she had
    seen other photos of the appellants in other contexts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jurisprudence cautions trial judges to
    remain alive to badges of unreliability in a witness’s identification of an
    accused: <em>Jack</em>, at para. 29. In this case, one important badge was the
    lack of any evidence concerning Ms. Whilby’s prior descriptions of the
    appellants, followed by her subsequent generic explanations for why she chose
    their photos from the line-ups. The trial judge failed to draw sufficient
    attention to these frailties in the evidence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the subject of the lack of a prior description,
    the trial judge told the jury the following: “In this case, it is unclear

    improper. It tipped the scales in favour of the reliability of Ms. Whilby’s
    ultimate identification, as it permitted the jury to infer an indicator of
    reliability from an absence of any evidence. Further, as this instruction was
    given immediately after standard instructions concerning the evaluation of the
    impact of a prior description, it effectively undervalued the important role a
    prior description plays in permitting a trier of fact to assess the reliability
    of a subsequent identification through comparison of the original description

    as to how the police got any of the accused’s names and pictures” and he
    reminded the jury that the record in any criminal prosecution rarely answers
    every question one might have about the facts. With respect, this instruction

    impression”. </span></p>

    the traits Ms. Whilby wrote on the back of the photo of the appellants. A
    proper instruction would have pointed out that the descriptions were generic: <em>Jack</em>,
    at para. 16. Although the appellants have not alleged that Ms. Whilby failed to
    mention some distinctive characteristics of their appearances, as was the case
    in <em>R. v. Yigzaw</em>, 2013 ONCA 547, 301 C.C.C. (3d) 266, at para. 63, I am
    satisfied that the trial judge erred in failing to acknowledge that Ms. Whilby’s
    descriptions of the appellants gave little reason to believe her identifications
    were reliable.</span></p>

    evidence, the trial judge ought to have cautioned the jury that the repeated
    in-court identifications of the appellants by Ms. Whilby, which the Crown
    elicited, were entitled to little weight: <em>Yigzaw</em>, at para. 71; <em>Hibbert</em>,
    at para. 50; <em>R. v. Pelletier</em>, 2012 ONCA 566, 291 C.C.C. (3d) 279, at

lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s instructions failed to convey all
    the reasons why the jury ought to subject Ms. Whilby’s testimony to special
    scrutiny. Moreover, with respect to Ms. Whilby’s identifications of the
    appellants, the trial judge left the jury with an unfocused treatise on factors
    that may come to bear on the reliability of eyewitness evidence, many of which
    had no basis in the evidence. Cumulatively, the instructions failed to impress
    upon the jury that there were significant reasons to doubt both Ms. Whilby’s
    credibility and the reliability of her identifications. </span></p>

    significant task in this trial was deciding whether to believe Ms. Whilby. On
    the basis of the jury instructions, I am unable to conclude that the jury was

    satisfied that these errors left the jury “inadequately equipped to properly
    evaluate important evidence”: <em>R. v. Bailey</em>, 2016 ONCA 516, 339 C.C.C.
    (3d) 463, at para. 56. Irrespective of any oversight by their lawyers, the
    appellants were entitled to a fair trial, and there was no tactical advantage
    to be gained from the failure to object: <em>Phillips</em>, at para. 31. </span></p>
