    appeal, pursuant to s. 13 of the <em>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 (“<em>CCAA</em>”), from the order of Hainey J. dated May
    7, 2020, which required GCI to pay DEL Equipment Inc. (“DEL”) the amount of
    $874,107.08 (the “Funds”) then being held in trust pursuant to an earlier court
    order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We refuse GCI leave to appeal. In accordance
    with the practice of this court on motions for leave to appeal under the <em>CCAA</em>,
    these brief reasons explain our refusal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE DISPUTE</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>DEL manufactures special truck bodies and
    equipment. GCI also manufactures and customizes trucks. In June 2017, DEL and
    GCI entered into a management agreement under which GCI assumed management
    control of DEL and ultimately could earn a 100% equity interest in DEL if
    certain milestones were reached. However, the parties terminated the agreement
    on July 18, 2019, at which time GCI ceased to manage DEL’s business.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2018, DEL received two purchase orders from
    Mack Defense LLC (“Mack Defense”) for certain trucks. In May and June 2019, DEL
    delivered the trucks. In June 2019, DEL issued invoices totaling $874,107.08 to
    Mack Defense, which made two payments totaling that amount in late August and
    early September2019. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, Mack Defense mistakenly sent the
    payments to GCI, instead of to DEL. It appears the mistake originated when Mack
    Defense sought to confirm payment instructions for the trucks back in April
    2019, when GCI was managing DEL. A GCI representative answered Mack Defense’s
    inquiry and mistakenly provided instructions to direct payment to GCI’s
    account. Although a DEL representative later provided Mack Defense with the
    proper payment instructions, Mack Defense ended up mistakenly paying the DEL
    invoiced amounts to GCI.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In mid-September 2019, DEL followed up with Mack
    Defense and learned about the mistaken payments. DEL asked GCI to transfer the $874,107.08
    to it. Although GCI acknowledged that the payments by Mack Defense were
    intended to satisfy DEL’s invoices, GCI refused to transfer the Funds. GCI took
    the position that it was entitled to retain the Funds as a set-off against
    other obligations of DEL to GCI, including those that arose under the
    management agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mack Defense viewed the matter as a dispute
    between DEL and GCI.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 22, 2019, DEL was granted protection
    under the <em>CCAA</em>. As of that date, DEL owed GCI and related companies
    approximately $1.5 million.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge then granted a preservation
    order requiring that GCI transfer the Funds to its lawyers pending further
    order of the court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Subsequently, DEL and GCI brought competing
    motions asserting entitlement to the Funds. The motion judge ordered the Funds
    be paid to DEL and that, pending payment of the Funds to DEL, the Funds are
    subject to a constructive trust in favour of DEL. GCI now seeks leave to appeal
    that order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By order dated June 24, 2020, Thorburn J.A.
    directed that this motion for leave to appeal be expedited and, if leave was
    not granted, the Funds be paid out to DEL within two business days of the order
    refusing leave to appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>ANALYSIS</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The governing test</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court will only sparingly grant leave to
    appeal in the context of a <em>CCAA</em> proceeding. Leave will be granted only
    where there are “serious and arguable grounds that are of real and significant
    interest to the parties”, determined by considering whether: (i) the proposed
    appeal is <em>prima facie</em> meritorious or frivolous; (ii) <a
name="_Hlk49326044">the issue on the proposed appeal is of significance to the
    practice; (iii) the issue on the proposed appeal is of significance to the
    proceeding; and (iv) the proposed appeal will unduly hinder the progress of the
    proceeding:</a> <em>Stelco Inc., (Re)</em> (2005), 75 O.R. (3d) 5 (C.A.), at
    para. 24.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-CA>Whether the
    proposed appeal is <em>prima facie</em> meritorious or frivolous</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge concluded that: (i) GCI
    unjustly enriched itself by retaining the Funds and refusing to pay them to DEL
    or return them to Mack; and (ii) GCI’s retention of the Funds constitutes an
    improper preference over DEL’s other creditors. In dealing with the issue of
    whether a juristic reason existed for GCI’s receipt and retention of the Funds,
    the motion judge stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have also concluded that there is no
    juristic reason for GCI’s enrichment of receiving and retaining the Funds
    because,</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(a) the Funds were never intended for GCI;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) GCI cannot rely on set off as a
    juristic reason for its enrichment because the Supreme Court of Canada made
    this clear at para. 114 of its decision in <i>Kerr v. Baranow, </i>2011 SCC 10,
    [2011] 1 S.C.R. 269;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(c) GCI has acknowledged that it received
    the Funds by mistake which is not a juristic reason for its enrichment;</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(d) GCI is not an “innocent” recipient of
    the Funds because its own employees were at least, in part, the cause of the
    mistaken payment; and</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(e) GCI’s retention of the Funds
    constitutes an improper preference over DEL’s other creditors.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>GCI’s primary submission is that the motion
    judge erred in holding that GCI could not rely on set-off as a juristic reason
    to defend a claim of unjust enrichment. GCI contends that set-off can
    constitute a juristic reason in a commercial law context and <em>CCAA</em> s.
    21 creates a statutory right of set-off available in <em>CCAA</em> proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not persuaded that the proposed appeal is <i>prima facie</i> meritorious. In our view, GCI has not raised any arguments
    that provide good reason to doubt the motion judge’s decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In particular, we are not persuaded GCI’s
    submission on juristic reason is <em>prima facie</em> meritorious. <em>Kerr</em> remains the leading authority on the elements of a claim for unjust enrichment.
    On the issue of juristic reason, <em>Kerr</em> drew upon the two-step juristic
    reason analysis described in the Supreme Court of Canada’s earlier decision in <em>Garland
    v. Consumers Gas Co.</em>, 2004 SCC 25, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 629. As the motion
    judge correctly noted, that two-step analysis is summarized at para. 114 of <i>Kerr</i>,
    where the Supreme Court stated, in part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The juristic reason analysis is intended to
    reveal whether there is a reason for the defendant to retain the enrichment, <span
class=Underline>not to determine its value or whether the enrichment should be
    set off against reciprocal benefits</span>: <i>Wilson</i>, at para. 30. <i>Garland</i> established that claimants must show that there is no juristic reason falling
    within any of the established categories, such as whether the benefit was a
    gift or pursuant to a legal obligation. If that is established, it is open to
    the defendant to show that a different juristic reason for the enrichment
    should be recognized, having regard to the parties’ reasonable expectations and
    public policy considerations. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the fact that the parties have conferred
    benefits on each other may be considered at the juristic reasons stage, it can
    only be considered for the limited purpose of providing evidence of the
    parties’ reasonable expectations that could support the existence of a juristic
    reason outside the settled categories: <em>Kerr</em>, at para. 115.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge’s reasons reveal that he
    applied <i>Kerr’</i>s two-step juristic reason analysis to the specific facts
    of this case. There was no evidence that GCI’s receipt of a benefit of
    $874,107.08 from Mack Defense was pursuant to a legal obligation. On the contrary,
    GCI mistakenly received the Funds from Mack Defense, which should have sent the
    Funds to DEL to satisfy the invoices for DEL’s delivery of trucks to Mack
    Defense. <em>CCAA</em> s. 21</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=EN-CA> recognizes
    that a creditor may raise the common law defence of set-off when sued by a
    company under <em>CCAA</em> protection. However, this does not alter the fact
    that, in this case, the Funds were mistakenly paid to and received by GCI. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, the fact that DEL was indebted to GCI
    at the time of Mack Defense’s mistaken payments was not, in the circumstances,
    evidence of any reasonable expectation by DEL and GCI that a juristic reason
    existed for GCI to retain the mistakenly paid Funds. Indeed, the evidence was
    to the contrary. As soon as DEL discovered that Mack Defense had mistakenly
    paid the Funds to GCI, DEL demanded that GCI transfer the Funds to it.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='text-align:justify;line-height:115%'><span lang=EN-CA>The
    remaining factors: the significance of the issue to the proceeding;
    significance to the practice; and the impact on the progress of the <em>CCAA</em> proceeding</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the issue of the entitlement to the Funds
    is of significance to the parties to the proceeding, we are not persuaded that
    the proposed appeal raises any issues of significance to the practice. The proposed
    appeal turns on applying well-established principles of law to the unique facts
    of this case, which include the existence of a management agreement in effect between
    DEL and GCI at the time Mack Defense sought instructions for the payment of the
    Funds. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The final factor to consider is whether the proposed
    appeal will unduly hinder the progress of the proceeding. We regard this factor
    as neutral. On the one hand, DEL submits that the only remaining task in the <i>CCAA</i> proceeding is to distribute funds to unsecured creditors, which cannot occur
    until the amount available to unsecured creditors is determined. That, in turn,
    would depend upon the outcome of the proposed appeal. On the other hand, GCI
    argues that there is no evidence in the record of any prejudice to the <em>CCAA </em>proceeding in the event leave were to be granted. As well, GCI submits
    that the appeal could be expedited, as was the hearing of this motion for leave
    to appeal. </span></p>
