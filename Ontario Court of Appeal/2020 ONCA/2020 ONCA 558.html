lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal concerns a form of insurance commonly
    used in the construction industry. It permits a contractor to add the project
    owner as an additional insured under its liability insurance policy, to cover
    the owner’s liability “arising out of the operations” of the contractor. This
    appeal focuses on the requisite connection between the contractor’s operations
    and the owner’s liability.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The following overview will provide context to
    the issues. I will add detail later, as required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Sky Clean Energy Ltd. (“Sky”), is
    a developer of solar energy projects, including rooftop solar systems that
    supply electricity to the power grid. Marnoch Electrical Services Inc.
    (“Marnoch”) is an electrical contracting company. Sky entered into contracts
    with Marnoch for the construction of two such projects. On completion of the
    projects, Sky sold them to Firelight Solar Limited Partnership (“Firelight”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under these contracts, Marnoch agreed to
    indemnify Sky against Marnoch’s failure to perform its contractual obligations
    and for the negligent acts of Marnoch, its subcontractors, or other parties for
    whom it was liable. Marnoch also agreed to name Sky as an insured under its comprehensive
    general liability insurance policy with the respondent, Economical Mutual
    Insurance Company (“Economical”), but “only with respect to liability, other
    than legal liability arising out of [Sky’s] sole negligence, arising out of the
    operations of [Marnoch] with regard to the <em>Work</em>.” Marnoch’s insurance
    broker, Firstbrook, Cassie &amp; Anderson Ltd. (“FCA”), issued two insurance
    certificates to Sky, confirming that it was entitled to coverage pursuant to an
    “Additional Insured Endorsement” under Marnoch’s commercial general liability
    policy. That endorsement provided that Marnoch’s liability insurance applied to
    Sky “but only with respect to liability arising out of the operations of
    [Marnoch]”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fires occurred at both installations. They
    originated in the electrical transformers and resulted in damages to both
    transformers. A third transformer, identical to the other two, was replaced
    because it was considered to be too great a risk to remain in service. As a
    result of these events, Sky incurred liabilities to Firelight for remediation
    costs and loss of revenue. It settled with Firelight and then sought to recover
    those damages, first against Marnoch, then against Economical.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sky commenced an arbitration against Marnoch, as
    required by their contract. The claim was based on both the contractual
    indemnity and on warranties given by Marnoch. The arbitrator, C.C. Lax, Q.C.,
    dismissed Sky’s claims. He found that the transformers had been selected by Sky
    and that Marnoch had played no role in the choice of either the supplier of the
    transformers or the transformers themselves: “Marnoch’s role was simply to
    implement Sky’s decision.” The arbitrator dismissed Sky’s warranty claims for
    similar reasons: Sky did not rely on Marnoch’s skill and judgment with respect
    to the suitability of the transformers and “Sky cannot hold Marnoch responsible
    or liable for the consequences of Sky’s own decisions.” An appeal to the
    Superior Court from the arbitration award was dismissed: <em>Sky Solar (Canada)
    Ltd. v. Marnoch Electrical Services Inc.</em>, 2016 ONSC 1295.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sky then commenced this action against
    Economical and against Marnoch’s insurance broker, FCA. To simplify the
    proceedings, the parties agreed that the findings of fact made by the arbitrator
    would be binding on the trial judge. After a ten-day trial, the trial judge
    dismissed the claim against FCA, an order Sky does not appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also dismissed Sky’s claim
    against Economical. I will explain his reasons, with which I am in substantial
    agreement, in the &quot;Analysis” section, below. In summary, he found that the
    design of the solar systems, including the wiring and the choice of equipment,
    were Sky’s responsibility. Marnoch played no role in the decisions to purchase
    or install the transformers used at the two project locations. He concluded that
    Sky’s liability did not “arise out of the operations” of Marnoch.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also found that Sky had breached
    Condition Four of the insurance policy by settling with Firelight without Economical’s
    consent and that Sky was not entitled to relief from forfeiture. Finally, the
    trial judge dismissed Sky’s claim against Economical for punitive damages for
    breach of the duty of good faith.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sky raises the following grounds of appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the trial judge erred in interpreting the

  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the trial judge erred in finding that Sky’s claim
    was barred by a breach of Condition Four of the policy or, alternatively, in
    failing to grant relief from forfeiture;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the trial judge erred in finding that Economical
    had not breached its duty of good faith and declining to award punitive damages;
    and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2CxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the trial judge erred in awarding excessive costs.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The analysis of this issue requires a more

lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2010, Sky entered into contracts with Ontario
    Power Authority to provide electricity generated by rooftop solar projects to
    be constructed on two buildings, one on Whybank Street in Brampton, Ontario
    (“Whybank”) and the other on Manchester Street in Bolton, Ontario
    (“Manchester”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In February and April 2012, Sky contracted with
    Marnoch to construct the two projects.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In November and December 2012, Sky transferred
    ownership of the projects to Firelight. The sale agreements contained
    warranties and indemnities given by Sky to Firelight. The agreements also
    assigned to Firelight the benefits of the warranties given by Marnoch to Sky in
    the construction contracts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In explaining the events giving rise to the
    claim, the trial judge set out the findings of the arbitrator at para. 48 of
    his reasons. I will summarize those findings, borrowing from the arbitrator’s
    language.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The initial scope of Marnoch’s work under the
    two contracts was limited to the installation of a solar power system that had
    been designed by Sky using equipment that had been selected and sourced by Sky.
    Sky contracted with equipment suppliers to provide the main components for the
    system, including two critical components, the inverter and the transformer. It
    was Marnoch’s responsibility to install the components in the projects.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Whybank was the first of the two sites to be prepared
    for construction. Before commencing the installation, Marnoch’s foreman noticed
    that the transformer delivered to the site by Sky’s supplier did not conform to
    the design parameters specified in Sky's drawing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The delivery of the wrong type of transformer to
    Whybank (with another scheduled for delivery to Manchester) threatened the
    construction schedules for both projects. The manufacturer advised that it
    would need approximately six weeks to build the appropriate transformer. The delay
    was unacceptable to Sky, which had sold the projects and their income streams
    to Firelight and was anxious to get them operating.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Faced with the risk of a significant delay, Sky asked
    Marnoch for assistance in sourcing replacement transformers for the two project
    locations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While not contractually obligated to source the
    transformers, Marnoch agreed to ask its own equipment supplier to search for a
    suitable replacement. Sky provided Marnoch with the technical description of
    the correct transformer and with this information in hand, Marnoch’s supplier
    located a transformer manufactured by Marcus Transformers of Canada Ltd.
    (&quot;Marcus&quot;). Marcus could deliver a transformer that met Sky's
    specifications within five days of receipt of approved shop drawings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was Sky’s decision whether or not to accept
    the Marcus transformer. Marnoch was not asked for its opinion on the
    suitability of the Marcus transformer, nor did it have the technical expertise
    to make that assessment. Marnoch was neither an electrical engineer nor an
    electrical consultant, but an electrical contractor with considerable

    site recorded that with no power flowing from the solar panels, the transformer
    was still drawing power. This could only have originated from the hydroelectric
    grid. The Marnoch electrician suggested to the Sky representative that the
    system should be shut down until a satisfactory explanation for the anomaly
    could be determined. But the Sky representative, apparently concerned about the
    loss of revenue if the system were shut down, decided to leave the system

    not required to indemnify Sky for matters that were not within Marnoch’s

    be an additional insured should obtain a copy of the insurance policy and the

    Court decisions that interpreted the words “arising out of” and “arising from”,
    including: <em>Amos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia</em>, [1995] 3
    S.C.R. 405; <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Herbison</em>, 2007 SCC 47,
    [2007] 3 S.C.R. 393; and <em>Citadel General Assurance Co. v. Vytlingam</em>,
    2007 SCC 46, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 373. In those cases, the Supreme Court consistently
    interpreted “arising from” and “arising out of” to require more than a “but
    for” connection between the liability of the additional insured and the
    operations of the named insured. While a “but for” test is necessary, it is not
    sufficient. Specifically, there must be &quot;an unbroken chain of causation”
    and a connection that is more than “merely incidental or fortuitous”. While
    those cases involved automobile insurance legislation, Finch C.J.B.C.
    determined that the words “arising from” and “arising out of” should be
    interpreted the same way when they appear in the context of insurance
    contracts, such as additional insured endorsements.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To be clear, while the language of “but for” and
    “causation” originally emerged from the law of negligence, these concepts have
    since developed separately in the context of interpreting insurance coverage. In
    the field of negligence, the “but for” test of causation is used to determine
    whether the loss suffered occurred as a result of the <span class=Underline>wrongdoing</span> of the defendant: <em>Clements v. Clements</em>, 2012 SCC 32, [2012] 2 S.C.R.
    181. But in the insurance interpretation context, fault is not required for
    coverage to be engaged, unless specified in the policy. In fact, many insurance
    policies provide coverage for losses even when no party is identified as being
    at fault, as is the case here.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Amos</em>, the Supreme Court interpreted
    the scope of coverage provided by no-fault motor vehicle insurance, as set out
    in British Columbia’s insurance legislation. The legislation stipulated that insurance
    benefits would be paid for death or injury “caused by an accident that <span
class=Underline>arises out of</span> the ownership, use or operation of a vehicle”
    (emphasis added). The Supreme Court set out a two-part test for interpreting that
    provision, at para. 17:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>1.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> Did the accident result from the ordinary and well-known activities
    to which automobiles are put?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> Is there <span class=Underline>some</span> <em>nexus or causal
    relationship</em> (not necessarily a direct or proximate causal relationship)
    between the appellant's injuries and the ownership, use or operation of his
    vehicle, or is the connection between the injuries and the ownership, use or
    operation of the vehicle <em>merely incidental or fortuitous</em>? [Underlining

lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court then extended the principles
    set out in <em>Amos</em> to two subsequent companion cases involving automobile
    liability insurance: <em>Herbison</em> and <em>Citadel</em>. In these cases,
    the Supreme Court interpreted s. 239(1)(a) of the Ontario <em>Insurance Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, which stipulates that motor vehicle insurance policies will
    cover loss or damage “<span class=Underline>arising from</span> the ownership

    from” to mean an unbroken chain of causation, which is more than merely
    incidental or fortuitous: <em>Citadel</em>, at para. 12; <em>Herbison</em>, at
    para. 12. In <em>Citadel</em>, the insured used his vehicle to transport a
    boulder onto a highway overpass, he then dropped the boulder onto oncoming
    traffic. The claimant was struck and injured. In <em>Herbison</em>, the insured
    drove his truck to a hunting site. On the way, he got out of the truck to shoot
    what he thought was a deer. Unfortunately, he shot another hunter, who sought
    indemnity from the driver’s insurer.</span></p>

    injuries did not arise from the operation of the vehicles. While the vehicles
    were necessary in the “but for” sense – neither insured would otherwise have
    been at the location of the accident – the injuries arose from other distinct acts.
    In <em>Citadel</em>, the injury arose from the insured throwing the boulder,
    and in <em>Herbison</em>, the injury resulted from the insured shooting into
    the distance.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given the Supreme Court’s consistent
    interpretation of “arising from” and “arising out of” in this line of authority,
    Finch C.J.B.C. concluded that these words should carry the same meaning,
    regardless of whether they appear in a statute or in a contract. He explained
    that “it would not further the objectives of certainty and consistency in the

    “City”) was named as an additional insured on the commercial general liability
    policy of the operator of an “Oktoberfest” parade. The plaintiffs were injured
    at a train crossing near where they were watching the parade. The City sought
    an order compelling the insurer to provide a defence to the plaintiffs’ action.
    The additional insured endorsement provided coverage for the City as an
    additional insured “but only with respect to liability arising out of the
    operations of the named insured”.</span></p>

    allegations in the pleadings to suggest that the City’s liability “arose out
    of” the operations of the parade operator, using that term in the sense of
    “originating from”, “growing out of”, “flowing from”, “incident to” or “having
    connection with”. The plaintiffs had not even sued the parade operator and the
    parade was only the site or occasion of the plaintiffs’ accident. The parade
    operator’s insurer had no duty to defend the City.</span></p>

    its highest, but for the parade, the plaintiffs would not have been standing
    near the railway tracks and the accident would not have happened. This was not,

    the parade and the City’s alleged liability to the plaintiffs that was more

    customer was injured when she slipped on an allegedly wet floor. The store
    owner had contracted with a janitorial service to wash the floors and keep them
    clean. A&amp;P, the store owner, was added as an additional insured on the
    contractor’s policy, but “only with respect to liability arising out of the
    operations of the Named Insured”. The judge described it as a “simple slip and
    fall alleged to have occurred as a result of negligent janitorial operations”:
    at para. 49. The plaintiff alleged that A&amp;P had breached its obligation to
    keep the floor safe. The trial judge held that the insurer had a duty to defend
    the store owner. The factual allegations of negligence against A&amp;P were in
    respect of unsafe conditions left by the floor-cleaning operator. There were no
    other allegations of negligence against A&amp;P. Therefore, A&amp;P’s liability

    claiming that she had improperly accessed her medical records. The policy in
    question covered claims for invasion of privacy. The nurse sought a declaration
    that the hospital’s insurer had a duty to defend. The insurer argued, however,
    that the claim did not arise from the operations of the hospital; rather, it arose
    from the nurse allegedly accessing the medical records of a patient who was not
    under her care. The trial judge found that the policy insured claims for breach
    of privacy and that the collection and maintenance of medical records was part
    of the operations of the hospital. The judge, adopting the definition of
    “operations” in <em>Vernon</em>, found that the insurer had a duty to defend.

lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In sum, I agree with the articulation in <em>Vernon</em> of the requisite connection between the named insured’s operations and the
    liability of the additional insured, in respect of which it seeks insurance
    coverage. It provides certainty and predictability for all parties by requiring
    more than an incidental or fortuitous connection between the liability of the
    additional insured and the named insured’s operations. This limitation is
    consistent with both the reasonable expectations of the parties to the
    construction contract and that of their liability insurers.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To summarize, the phrase “arising out of the
    operations” requires more than a “but for” connection between the liability of
    the additional insured and the operations of the named insured. There must be
    &quot;an unbroken chain of causation” and a connection that is more than
    “merely incidental or fortuitous”: <em>Vernon</em>, at para. 52. Furthermore,
    the word “operations” includes “the creation of a situation, or circumstance,
    that is connected in some way to the alleged liability. It does not necessarily
    imply an <span class=Underline>active</span> role by the named insured in
    creation of the liability event”: <em>Vernon</em>, at para. 54.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the trial judge that Marnoch’s
    connection with the failure of the Marcus transformer was “merely incidental”. The
    trial judge found that the fire was caused by the failure of the Marcus
    transformer. The fire would not have occurred but for the fact that Marnoch
    ordered and installed the transformers “in the course of” Marnoch’s operations
    under its contracts with Sky. But <em>Vernon</em> requires a stronger connection.
    Marnoch’s operations under the contracts did not require it to select the
    transformers to be installed in the projects. That was up to Sky. And Sky chose
    the Marcus transformers that failed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Marnoch’s position in this case is similar to
    that of the hockey club in <em>Vernon</em> and of the operators of the
    Oktoberfest parade in <em>Waterloo</em>. It was effectively a bystander to the decisions
    of the additional insured. Its operations had a “but for” connection to Sky’s
    liability, but nothing more.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result of my conclusion on the first issue,

    breach of Condition Four and in denying relief from forfeiture.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third issue: Did the trial judge err in finding
    that Economical had not breached its duty of good faith and declining to award
    punitive damages?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sky contended that Economical breached its duty
    of good faith by: (a) initially denying coverage without conducting an
    investigation; (b) interpreting the Additional Insured Endorsement too narrowly
    and ignoring the judicial interpretation in cases like <em>Great Atlantic</em>;
    and (c) failing to follow its own claims procedures, as it did not appoint an
    adjuster or investigate Sky’s losses. This is a separate cause of action,
    distinct from the coverage claim. In my view, however, the trial judge did not
    err in dismissing the claim for punitive damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> First, the trial judge found that Economical’s delay
    of 13 days in acknowledging that Sky was an additional insured did not rise to
    the level of bad faith.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, he found that the <em>Great Atlantic</em> case, relied upon by the appellant, was materially different from this case,
    and that Economical did not act in bad faith in interpreting that decision. <em>Great
    Atlantic</em> involved allegations of negligence against the additional insured <span class=Underline>and</span> the named insured. In the present case, Sky
    does not allege negligence against Marnoch, the named insured.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, he found that Economical did not act in
    bad faith in denying coverage to Sky without appointing an adjuster or
    investigating Sky’s claim. By the time Sky made a claim under the policy,
    Economical knew that the transformers had been selected by Sky and that Marnoch
    had not made the decision. Economical had an objectively reasonable basis on
    which to deny coverage and was not required to make further investigations.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addressing the issue of good faith, the trial
    judge referred to the decision of this court in <em>702535 Ontario Inc. v.
    Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd’s London England</em> (2000), 184 D.L.R. (4th)
    687 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 27-33, leave to appeal refused, [2000] S.C.C.A. No.
    258. The Supreme Court of Canada referred to <em>702535 Ontario</em> with
    approval in the leading case of <em>Fidler v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada</em>,
    2006 SCC 30, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 3. In <em>Fidler</em>, the Supreme Court quoted
    from the decision of O’Connor J.A. in <em>702535 Ontario</em>, at para. 29<em>,</em> as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The duty of good faith also requires an
    insurer to deal with its insured's claim fairly. The duty to act fairly applies
    both to the manner in which the insurer investigates and assesses the claim and
    to the decision whether or not to pay the claim. In making a decision whether
    to refuse payment of a claim from its insured, an insurer must assess the
    merits of the claim in a balanced and reasonable manner. It must not deny coverage
    or delay payment in order to take advantage of the insured's economic
    vulnerability or to gain bargaining leverage in negotiating a settlement. A
    decision by an insurer to refuse payment should be based on a reasonable
    interpretation of its obligations under the policy. This duty of fairness,
    however, does not require that an insurer necessarily be correct in making a
    decision to dispute its obligation to pay a claim. Mere denial of a claim that
    ultimately succeeds is not, in itself, an act of bad faith.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I have concluded, as the trial judge did, that
    Economical was entitled to deny Sky’s claim under the policy. This conclusion
    takes some of the wind out of the sails of Sky’s claim for punitive damages. I
    agree with the trial judge that Economical’s initial rejection of coverage,
    while perhaps precipitous, was soon corrected and did not amount to bad faith. As
    in <em>Fidler</em>, the trial judge had the benefit of a fairly lengthy trial,
    which included evidence from Economical’s claims adjuster. The trial judge found
    that there was no reason to continue to investigate when there was an
    objectively reasonable basis on which to deny coverage. He considered all the
    evidence and his conclusions are entitled to deference.</span></p>

    not consider that any party's conduct tended to shorten or unnecessarily
