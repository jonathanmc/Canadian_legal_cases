  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Goderich-Exeter Railway Company Limited
    (“GEXR”), appeals from the dismissal of its claim against the respondents for “demurrage”.
     Demurrage is a charge by a railway to a shipper for the detention of the
    railway’s equipment and assets—its railcars—beyond a specified amount of “free
    time” allowed for loading or unloading.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> When properly payable, demurrage compensates the railway for the extended use
    of its assets and equipment and encourages their prompt return to the
    transportation network.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue at the core of this appeal concerns
    the source of a railway’s entitlement to charge demurrage, specifically whether
    a contract is required as the foundation for the claim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent, Parrish and Heimbecker Limited (“P&amp;H”),
    entered into an agreement with Canadian National Railway (“CN”) to ship grain
    by rail from Western Canada to Ontario. CN carried the grain for much of the
    rail journey. Pursuant to an agreement CN had with GEXR, GEXR carried the grain
    on its final leg, along the GEXR operated Guelph Line to a facility (“the
    Shantz Station”) where it was unloaded. The Shantz Station is owned by the
    respondent Shantz Station Terminal Ltd. (“SSTL”), a subsidiary of P&amp;H.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>GEXR claimed that its railcars were detained for
    longer than the “free time” stipulated in tariffs it had issued while the
    respondents unloaded them at the Shantz Station, and that, as the shippers of
    the grain, the respondents were liable to pay demurrage. The trial judge
    dismissed the claim, holding that GEXR had not established an express or
    implied contract with the respondents to be paid demurrage, nor the required
    elements of a claim for unjust enrichment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this court, GEXR does not assert an express
    contract. It argues that the trial judge was wrong to require a contract between
    it and the respondents. It submits that a railway is entitled to charge
    demurrage to a shipper that detains its railcars, in the absence of any
    agreement. Alternatively, GEXR argues that the trial judge erred in failing to
    find an implied contract or to give relief under the doctrine of unjust
    enrichment. Finally, GEXR seeks leave to appeal the trial judge’s refusal to
    stay her costs award.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal. A contract, express or implied, between a railway and a shipper is the
    required basis for a claim for demurrage. There was no express contract between
    P&amp;H and GEXR. Furthermore, in light of the parties’ conduct – including the
    contract between P&amp;H and CN to which GEXR was not privy, the contract
    between CN and GEXR to which the respondents were not privy, and P&amp;H’s
    repeated statements to GEXR that it would not honour any of GEXR claims for
    demurrage – the trial judge did not err in finding that there was no implied
    contract between the respondents and GEXR permitting it to charge them
    demurrage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The elements of a claim for unjust enrichment were
    also not established by GEXR. Nor did the trial judge err in exercising her
    discretion not to defer making a costs award or refusing to stay the award she
    made.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE FACTUAL CONTEXT</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>GEXR Operates the Guelph Line Under a Lease
    from CN </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Guelph Line is a rail line owned by CN that runs
    from Georgetown, Ontario to London, Ontario. GEXR obtained the right to operate
    a railroad on the Guelph Line in 1998, under a lease from CN that had a 20-year
    term. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Pursuant to a Certificate of Fitness issued
    under the <em>Canada Transportation Act</em>, S.C. 1996, c.10 (the “<em>CTA</em>”),
    GEXR was the only authorized operator on the Guelph Line for the term of the
    lease and had all the obligations and status of a railroad under federal
    legislation.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>GEXR’s Interchange Agreement with CN</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>CN and GEXR entered into the Guelph Line
    Operating, Marketing and Interchange Agreement in November 1998 (the
    “Interchange Agreement”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Interchange Agreement gave CN the right to
    contract with shippers to carry freight over its own lines and onward to points
    on the Guelph Line, even though GEXR was the operator of the Guelph Line. Article
    11.2 provided that CN would continue to market services on the Guelph Line, and
    would be entitled to publish tariffs, enter into contracts, and collect for CN’s
    own account all related revenues for traffic to and from stations on the Guelph
    Line which travelled over CN lines. GEXR was to be paid a haulage fee by CN for
    such traffic. As noted below, CN referenced this provision when contracting
    with P&amp;H to carry grain to the Shantz Station.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Interchange Agreement also contained a
    provision CN seems to have ignored when it subsequently contracted with P&amp;H.
    Article 11.5 of the Interchange Agreement provided that GEXR would have the
    right to publish tariffs or enter into contracts governing incidental services
    to “normal interline movements”, including for demurrage.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>P&amp;H Contracts with CN to Carry Grain to the
    Shantz Station</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>P&amp;H is a grain company. It ships grain from Western
    Canada for supply to flour mills in Eastern Canada. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Starting in 2001, negotiations took place
    between CN and P&amp;H about CN being the carrier for such shipments, which
    would travel to a grain terminal to be built by P&amp;H in Ontario close to
    four flour mills that P&amp;H supplied. After various proposed sites on
    CN-operated lines proved to be unworkable, CN proposed that the terminal be
    built on the Guelph Line (the line operated by GEXR).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that, notwithstanding that
    the Guelph Line was GEXR operated, “P&amp;H wanted solely to deal with CN and
    wanted no commercial relations with GEXR.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In March 2003, CN entered into a Memorandum of
    Understanding (the “MOU”) with P&amp;H, to which GEXR was not a party. The MOU
    contemplated that P&amp;H would ship grain from Western Canada to a terminal that
    it would construct, using CN as carrier. The MOU referenced the Interchange
    Agreement CN had with GEXR, including the substance of article 11.2, which provided
    that CN had the right to contract for carriage to stations on the Guelph Line
    and to collect all related revenues. The MOU did not refer to article 11.5 of
    the Interchange Agreement or otherwise to the prospect of GEXR claiming
    demurrage from P&amp;H. The MOU referred to a CN tariff under which demurrage
    would be charged. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The MOU provided for arbitration of disputes
    between P&amp;H and CN.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the MOU was an
    agreement solely between CN and P&amp;H, and that among other things it reflected
    “CN’s assurances to P&amp;H that only CN would invoice P&amp;H for demurrage”.
    She noted the inconsistency between the Interchange Agreement provision by
    which CN had agreed that GEXR would be allowed to charge interline customers
    demurrage, and the MOU provisions by which CN assured P&amp;H that only CN (and
    not GEXR) would charge demurrage. She stated: “[f]or reasons that are unclear,
    portions of the MOU are directly contrary to CN’s agreement with GEXR,
    especially as it relates to GEXR’s ability to bill accessorial charges”.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='page-break-after:avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>The Shantz
    Station and the Shipment and Unloading of Grain</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the strength of the MOU, SSTL was
    incorporated as a P&amp;H subsidiary. In 2003, it constructed and opened the
    Shantz Station at Breslau, Ontario, located on the Guelph Line, for the purpose
    of unloading grain of P&amp;H, its sole customer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>From the time the Shantz Station was built until
    November 2018, railcars carrying P&amp;H grain travelled on CN lines from
    Western Canada to Ontario, and ultimately to the Shantz Station. The trial
    judge found that those shipments were pursuant to contractual commitments
    between P&amp;H and CN, whereas GEXR’s involvement was pursuant to its contract
    with CN.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When P&amp;H wished to send shipments, CN would
    create a waybill or bill of lading for each shipment that described P&amp;H as shipper
    and consignee with the “care of party” listed as Shantz Station. The grain was then
    carried on CN operated lines to CN’s MacMillan Yard in Toronto. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In order to move the grain to the Shantz
    Station, CN would send a waybill to GEXR. GEXR was thereupon required to take
    railcars from the CN line and interchange them onto the Guelph Line. GEXR
    engines would pick up the cars at MacMillan Yard and take them to Shantz
    Station.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>GEXR would provide P&amp;H with a report that
    listed the car numbers, commodity weight, customer name and address, and
    destination, and the respondents would direct GEXR regarding the placement of
    those railcars. After the grain was loaded by the respondents from railcars
    onto trucks at the Shantz Station, the respondents would notify GEXR when the
    empty railcars could be picked up. As the trial judge found, the respondents controlled
    when the empty cars could be released. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Tariffs</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As discussed below, the <em>CTA</em> contemplates
    the issuance and publication of tariffs by railways. Tariffs are the “schedule

    claiming payment of demurrage for occasions when the time taken to unload
    railcars at the Shantz Station exceeded the “free time” in the GEXR tariffs.
    P&amp;H refused to pay them, asserting that under its agreement with CN, only
    CN was entitled to charge it for demurrage. Although CN advised GEXR that, in
    its view, nothing prevented GEXR from claiming demurrage, GEXR did not
    ultimately pursue payment of the pre-2010 invoices. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>P&amp;H told GEXR that only CN has the right
    to charge and collect demurrage on P&amp;H traffic at Shantz Station.
    Notwithstanding the position P&amp;H advanced, GEXR kept sending invoices and
    kept providing services. At all relevant times, the defendants rejected any
    demurrage invoices GEXR sent to them and did not pay demurrage to GEXR.</span></p>

    to the respondents and remit what was paid to GEXR, parts of the invoices were
    disputed. Among other reasons, P&amp;H was not prepared to pay CN for delays
    that it attributed to CN’s conduct. In any event, that invoicing arrangement
    did not subsist. GEXR and the respondents reverted to their original positions.
    GEXR took the position it was entitled to charge demurrage directly to the
    respondents calculated under its tariffs. The respondents took the position
    that they had no obligation to pay GEXR any demurrage charges at all.</span></p>

    with the issues in four steps.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, she rejected GEXR’s argument that the <i>CTA</i> and GEXR’s issuance of tariffs under it gave GEXR the right to charge demurrage
    to a shipper without the need for any contract between them. She stated “[a]
    railway may not charge demurrage to a party with whom it has no contract”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the trial judge held that there was no
    express contract between GEXR and the respondents on which to base a claim for payment
    of demurrage. She stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>GEXR was not a party to a contract for the
    carriage of goods to Shantz Station. P&amp;H did not pay freight charges to
    GEXR or receive bills of lading from GEXR for the goods that were shipped to
    Shantz Station. I find that there was no express contract between GEXR and
    P&amp;H for the payment of demurrage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, she held there was no implied contract
    requiring such payment. Noting that the respondents had rejected every request
    for payment of demurrage that GEXR had made, she concluded: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The facts in this case do not give rise to an
    implied contract for payment of demurrage. P&amp;H’s repeated denials of any
    liability for demurrage, together with the long periods of time in which GEXR
    did not bill for demurrage (and appeared to accept P&amp;H’s position),
    preclude a finding of an implied contract between the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth, she rejected GEXR’s claim that it was
    entitled to payment based on the doctrine of unjust enrichment. In her view, GEXR
    had not established an enrichment of the respondents or that GEXR had suffered
    a corresponding deprivation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge refused to defer dealing with
    costs until after the completion of the arbitration between P&amp;H and CN, in

    basis for an entitlement to demurrage.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
lang=EN-CA>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It submits the trial judge erred in failing to

  <p class=MsoListNumber><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>In seeking leave to appeal costs, GEXR
    argues that the costs order should have been stayed until after P&amp;H

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ordinarily, the person from whom the goods are

    For the shipper is presumably the consignor; the transportation ordered by him
    is presumably on his own behalf; and a promise by him to pay therefor is

    either at destination or at reconsignment points, for a long period while
    seeking a market for the goods stored therein. To permit a shipper so to use
    freight cars is obviously beyond the ordinary duties of a carrier. <i>The right
    to assess charges for undue detention existed at common law</i>. Now, they are
    subject, like other freight charges, to regulation by the Commission. Demurrage

    could not be legally imposed by the railway or approved by its statutory
    regulator. His reference to demurrage previously having been a common law right
    does not suggest, at least as viewed through the lens of Ontario law, that it
    existed outside of contract; it simply contrasted how the right was previously governed
    (exclusively by the common law, which governed when and how a contract came
    into existence and the extent to which it could be enforced) with how the right
    came to be regulated (in part by statute).</span></p>

    In dismissing the appeal, Rand J. did not say anything that suggested a railway
    could charge demurrage to a person with whom it had no contract to ship or
    carry goods. Rather, his statement is more consistent with the view that, where
    there is a contract between a shipper and a railway for the movement of
    freight, a right to charge demurrage will be implied into that contract as the
    freight rates otherwise charged will necessarily have been based on the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is true, as CN argues, that the <em>CTA</em> does not expressly limit the application of a tariff to the party with whom CN
    contracts. Nor, however, does the <em>CTA</em><i> </i>expressly or by

    contract of carriage. The <em>CTA</em> does not authorize railway companies to
    impose tariffs on third parties. It requires railway companies to publish tariffs
    in order to inform prospective customers as to the nature and amount of the
    rates, charges and penalties they will be expected to pay pursuant to the
