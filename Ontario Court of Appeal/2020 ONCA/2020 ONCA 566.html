    dismissed Mr. Alis application for bail under s. 522 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>on July 4, 2018.</span></p>

    OMarra J. The Crowns case was almost complete by March 16, 2020 when public
    concern about the COVID-19 virus led to a postponement of the proceedings. The

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the meantime, the applicant applied to review
    his bail before the trial judge, pursuant to s. 523(2)(a) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. On May 15, 2020, the trial judge dismissed the application: <em>R.
    v. Ali</em>, 2020 ONSC 2968. Two weeks later, it became apparent that the trial
    could not continue due to the pandemic. The trial judge declared a mistrial and
    discharged the jury. It is anticipated that a new trial will not commence until
    March 2021. </span></p>

    bail status as the case travels through the trial process. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>The main bail review provisions are found in ss. 520, 521, 525 and

    2015 SCC 27, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 328, at paras. 90-139, permit the review of bail
    decisions made in respect of offences not listed in s. 469 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. Additionally, s. 525 of

    no jurisdiction for this court to review a s. 523(2)(a) order. However, he

    jurisdiction under s. 680 to review a decision made under s. 523(2)(a). As the
    Court said, at para. 15:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is trite law that this Court is a court of
    statutory jurisdiction. We were urged to find some means of review where the
    condition precedent to an order is the requirement that cause be shown. <u>However
    attractive this may be in principle, we are not prepared to ignore the plain
    wording of s-s.680(1) or to conclude that the omission of any reference to
    s.523 in s-s.680(1) is a mere oversight. In our view Parliament intended that
    an order made under s-s.523(2) by a judge of a superior court of criminal
    jurisdiction shall be a final order.</u> The result is that any review of such
    an order must be made by the Supreme Court of Canada under s-s.40(1) of
    the&nbsp;<i>Supreme Court Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, if that Court
    considers the criteria for leave to appeal are present. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    there is related support for this position. In <em>R. v. Purdy</em>, 2005 BCCA
    99, 208 B.C.A.C. 267, the accused was detained following a bail hearing under
    s. 522 of the <em>Code</em>. A bail review was conducted under s. 523(2)(c),
    which requires the consent of the Crown. That application was dismissed. </span></p>

    the <em>Criminal Code</em><i>.</i> The application was dismissed for want of
    jurisdiction. Although he did not refer to <em>Bukmeier</em>, Finch C.J.B.C.
    took the same approach, holding that the language of s. 680 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> does not provide for review of a s. 523 order (see <em>Purdy</em><i>, </i>at paras. 8-11).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court reached the same conclusion in <em>Passera</em>.
    Ms. Passera was found guilty of drug offences. On the date fixed for
    sentencing, she filed a constitutional challenge, the effect of which was to
    delay sentencing. In the meantime, Ms. Passera made an unsuccessful application
    to the trial judge for release under s. 523(2)(a) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.
    Recognizing that an order under s. 523(2)(a) could not be reviewed under s. 520
    because the trial had not yet concluded, she brought a <i>habeas corpus</i> application. That application was likewise dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the dismissal of the <em>habeas
    corpus</em> application, this court addressed the reviewability of orders made
    under s. 523(2)(a). As the court said, at paras. 10-13 and 15:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[10]    The first ground of appeal alleges
    that the application judge erred in failing to hold that, as a judge of the
    superior court of criminal jurisdiction, he had inherent jurisdiction to review
    the trial judge's order because of an unintentional legislative gap in
    the&nbsp;<i>Criminal Code</i>&nbsp; the failure to make express provision for
    a review of that order.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[11]    We do not agree.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>[12]    To begin, we do not consider the
    legislative lacuna relied upon by the appellant as an unintentional gap. We see
    it as a deliberate legislative choice to confer upon the trial judge the
    authority to alter an accused's judicial interim release status as trial
    proceedings unfold. In light of the plethora of other review mechanisms  as
    for example ss. 520, 521, 525 and 680  it simply cannot be said that
    Parliament's choice was other than deliberate</span></u><span lang=EN-CA>:&nbsp;<i>R.
    v. Bukmeier</i> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 272&nbsp;(B.C. C.A.), at paras. 15, 20.
    See also,&nbsp;<i>R. v. Durrani</i>, 2008 ONCA 856&nbsp;(Ont. C.A. [In
    Chambers]), at paras. 13-14.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[13]    The absence of a review mechanism and
    the unavailability of recourse to inherent jurisdiction to fill the gap is also
    consistent with general principle. The decisions of trial judges on procedural,
    evidentiary and substantive issues within their purview, in short, the
    management of trial proceedings, is left to the trial judge.&nbsp;<i>In limine</i>&nbsp;review
    proceedings, with their resultant delay; fragmentation of the criminal trial
    process; determination of issues on an incomplete and inadequate evidentiary
    record, not to mention their consumption of time and effort and unnecessary
    depletion of scarce judicial resources, are the antithesis of our system of
    criminal justice:&nbsp;<i>R. v. Johnson</i> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 49&nbsp;(Ont.
    C.A.), at para. 8.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[15]    Fourth, to give effect to the
    appellant's argument would be to permit circumnavigation of a clear
    Parliamentary intention to leave matters of judicial interim release at trial
    in the hands of the trial judge, where other equally significant procedural,
    evidentiary and substantive decisions reside, subject to review at the
    conclusion of trial proceedings. And, as the respondent points out, section
    523(2)(a) is itself a review provision since it involves consideration of a
    prior detention or release order.&nbsp;<u>What is more, there is nothing to
    prevent a second or subsequent application under s. 523(2)(a) as fortunes
    change at trial.</u> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    that the legislative gap is intentional. In 2019, Parliament made extensive
    changes to the bail provisions: Bill C-75, <em>An Act to amend the Criminal
    Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act and other Acts and to make consequential
    amendments to other Acts</em>, 1st Sess., 42nd Parl., 2019, c. 25. </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Minor changes were made to s. 680, but the ambit of the section was

    submits that the circumstances of this case are very different from <em>Passera</em> because there is no longer any need to protect a trial judge from outside
    interference. There is no trial. Consequently, the functional justifications
    for foreclosing a right of review no longer exist. </span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover,
    the courts reference to the ability of an accused to make a second or
    subsequent application under s. 523(2)(a) as fortunes change at trial is of no
    consolation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant submits that this jurisdictional
    barrier could be overcome by treating the order under review as one that was more
    properly made under s. 522, rather than s. 523(2)(a). The reason advanced for
    this reclassification is that, had the application for a bail review been made
    two weeks later  after the mistrial had been declared  the application would
    have been heard under s. 522, providing this court with jurisdiction to review
    the decision. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are problems with this position. First,
    the application was explicitly made under s. 523(2)(a). Given that the applicant
    had been placed in the charge of the jury at that time, s. 523(2)(a) was the
    only bail review mechanism at his disposal. The unforeseen declaration of a
    mistrial does not change this historical fact. To accede to this position would
    fictionalize what occurred solely to facilitate this courts claim of
    jurisdiction to review the applicants detention order. This is the type of
    circumnavigation that the court warned against in <em>Passera</em><i> </i>(see
    para. 15).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I return to the applicants argument, referred
    to above, that had the mistrial been granted two weeks later, any review of his
    bail would have been under s. 522 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. That is where
    his remedy now lies  he may apply for release under s. 522. Also, as indicated
    at para. 15 of <em>Bukmeier</em>, the applicant may apply for leave to appeal
    to the Supreme Court of Canada, although I accept that this might not be as practical
    a solution. Nonetheless, he is not without a means of reviewing his detention.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant submits that he prefers a review
    in this court under s. 680 because he wishes to assert error on the part of the
    trial judge; he contends that under s. 522, he would be restricted to arguing a
    material change of circumstances. While a s. 680 review may be the applicants
    preference, it does not eradicate the jurisdictional barrier. Although the
    issue was not fully argued before me, the applicants counsel indicated that
    the alleged error on the part of the trial judge is insufficiency of his
    reasons. I make no comment on the merits of this submission, but observe that, standing
    alone, a claim of insufficient reasons, if successful, would not result in the order
    under review being set aside. The court would still be required to examine the
    record to determine whether release is appropriate in all of the circumstances.
    This is ultimately what is required of a judge hearing a fresh application
    under s. 522.</span></p>
