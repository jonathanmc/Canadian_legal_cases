    judge (the “Order”) giving effect to two Letters of Request, or requests for
    international judicial assistance, addressed to the Ontario Superior Court of
    Justice from Judge Cymonie Rowe of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit of Florida in
    and for Palm Beach County (the “Florida Court”). Judge Rowe issued the Letters
    of Request at the instance of the respondents, Harold Peerenboom, Isaac
    Perlmutter, and Laura Perlmutter, in a proceeding commenced by Mr. Peerenboom in
    Florida against the Perlmutters.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>II.       THE FLORIDA PROCEEDING</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The background to the
    Florida proceeding initiated by Mr. Peerenboom against Isaac Perlmutter and his
    wife, Laura Perlmutter, was described by the application judge at para. 6 of
    his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The two [principal] applicants, Harold
    Peerenboom, a Canadian, and Isaac Perlmutter, an American (with his wife Laura
    Perlmutter), own homes, in Florida, within the same “private” community. They
    disagreed over the management of the community, particularly concerning the
    operation of its tennis centre. Within a time frame coincident with this
    dispute Harold Peerenboom began receiving what was referred to throughout the
    hearing of these applications as hate mail.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>From 2011 through 2016 Mr. Harold Peerenboom
    (“Mr. Peerenboom”) was the victim of a malicious and prolonged campaign of
    defamation and threats to harass, intimidate and extort him into leaving his
    Florida home. Throughout this period, repeated salvos of hundreds of anonymous
    hate letters falsely accusing him of loathsome crimes, including murder and
    sexual assault against a minor, were mailed throughout the United States and
    Canada to Mr. Peerenboom’s family, friends, neighbours, business associates,
    employees and clients (the “hate mail campaign”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Peerenboom thought
    the Perlmutters were orchestrating the hate-mail campaign. He commenced an
    action against them in the Florida courts (the “Florida Main Action”), as
    described by the application judge at paras. 12 and 13:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>During October 2013, Harold Peerenboom
    commenced an action in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in
    and for Palm Beach County, Florida. Suffice it to say the Complaint (in our
    lexicon, the Statement of Claim) has attached to it, exhibits which reference
    many more mailings to a wide assortment of people making all manner of
    insulting and unseemly comments about the character and actions of Harold
    Peerenboom.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The action named as defendants Isaac
    Perlmutter and his wife Laura Perlmutter, and unknown-at-the-time
    co-conspirators and asserted “…causes of action for defamation and defamation
    per se, intentional infliction of emotional distress, tortious interference,
    civil conspiracy and injunctive relief in connection with their actions in
    perpetrating the vicious and baseless hate mail campaign directed at
    Peerenboom”. On July 16, 2016, Isaac and Laura Perlmutter commenced a
    counterclaim against Harold Peerenboom and others for “…illegally, analysing
    and disclosing the Perlmutter’s genetic information in violation of Florida
    statutory and common law, in an effort to defame the Perlmutters by falsely
    implicating them in the Hate-Mail Campaign”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Smith is an Ontario
    resident. His involvement in the hate-mail campaign issues pleaded in the Florida
    Main Action came about in the following way, as described by the application
    judge at paras. 15, 16 and 18:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On January 21, 2016, the Detroit office of the
    Department of Homeland Security intercepted a package. Among other things, it
    contained anonymous letters that are described as “threatening in that the
    sender stated that he would send letters to various jails and prisoners in
    those jails, stating that Mr. Peerenboom is a child molester, if the
    Peerenboom[s] did not leave their home on Palm Beach”. On April 19, 2017, the
    Palm Beach Police Department notified the parties to the action that had been
    commenced by Harold Peerenboom against Isaac Perlmutter and his wife that the
    package had been intercepted.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The package included two letters one of which
    was addressed separately to two executives of Mandrake Management Consultants,
    identified as an executive search firm based in Toronto, and founded by Harold
    Peerenboom. The letter suggests that the two executives are just pawns of
    Harold Peerenboom and challenges them to convince him to sell his Florida home.
    It threatens that if they do not, the clients of the firm will be advised, by
    email and mail, of what a horrible person Harold Peerenboom is and suggests his
    involvement in “…sexual assault here in Florida, in Cuba and in the Far East
    and even up there in Canada”. It alleges that Harold Peerenboom has caused
    distress to his own family and makes negative assertions about his wife and
    youngest son.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The sending of the package was initiated at a
    United Parcel Service (“UPS”) store in Toronto. The shipping label identified
    the sender as Thomas Thorney. He was interviewed by the police. Investigators
    came to realize that he was unaware of the matters being investigated. <span
class=Underline>A review of the surveillance tape maintained by UPS revealed
    that the person who had delivered the package under the name of Thomas Thorney
    was, in fact, his business partner, David Smith. In the Amended Notice of
    Application, it is alleged that David Smith is a former employee of Mandrake
    Management Consultants who was terminated after 15 years of service, for cause</span>.
    In the Florida proceedings commenced by Harold Peerenboom against Isaac Perlmutter
    and his wife, it is alleged that Isaac Perlmutter is complicit in the intention
    to deliver the letters found in the package. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>III.      THE ONTARIO APPLICATIONS TO ENFORCE
    LETTERS OF REQUEST</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In August 2017, after
    discovering Mr. Smith’s involvement, the Perlmutters and Mr. Peerenboom filed a
    joint motion in the Florida Court for a letter of request seeking the Superior
    Court of Ontario’s assistance in obtaining evidence from Mr. Smith and Thomas
    Thorney. On September 1, 2017 the Florida Court issued its first Request for
    International Assistance to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (the “Initial
    Letter of Request”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Thomas Thorney complied
    with the Initial Letter of Request and was deposed in February 2018. Mr. Smith
    was not prepared to comply voluntarily with the Initial Letter of Request. He took
    the positions that it was overbroad and, since the motion for the Initial
    Letter of Request was granted on consent, the letter was not the product of
    substantive consideration by the Florida Court. The respondents then commenced
    an application in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on February 1, 2018 to
    enforce the Initial Letter of Request.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The application judge
    described, at para. 22, the ensuing events affecting the proceeding to enforce
    the Initial Letter of Request: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The issue of the cooperation of David Smith
    with this first Letter of Request was determined by the actions of the
    plaintiff, Harold Peerenboom. During February 2018 he commenced another action
    in Florida; this one against David Smith, Thomas Thorney and unnamed
    co-conspirators for their actions in working with others, including the
    Perlmutters, in perpetrating the hate mail campaign. Counsel for the various
    parties consulted. They agreed. There was no purpose in continuing with the
    existing Letter of Request. Counsel for the two applicants, the Perlmutters and
    Harold Peerenboom canvassed Ontario law (whether the Letter of Request would be
    enforced) and determined that as constituted, with Harold Peerenboom as co-applicant,
    that application could not succeed. Counsel for David Smith expressed the view
    that the existing application was “doomed to fail”. In commencing the action
    against David Smith, Harold Peerenboom had opened another avenue through which
    to obtain the evidence of David Smith. It was “otherwise obtainable”. The
    applicants sought to adjourn that matter. Counsel for David Smith refused. It
    was withdrawn.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    respondents’ efforts to enforce letters of request were described by the
    application judge at para. 23:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On April 30, 2018, Isaac Perlmutter and his
    wife commenced this application in the Superior Court of Ontario in an effort
    to “normalize” the application by removing Harold Peerenboom as a co-applicant.
    This renewal of the application was opposed by David Smith. He signalled his
    intention to bring a motion to strike the attempted renewal as an abuse of
    process. The parties convened a scheduling conference before Madam Justice
    Dietrich. It took place on May 28, 2018. Rather than schedule the application
    and the motion to strike, Madam Justice Dietrich ordered that “counsel for the
    moving party will seek a fresh letter of request on [an] expedited basis from
    the Florida Court following which, if he is successful in obtaining the letter,
    responding counsel will agree to a date for the application.”</span></p>

    aspects of the application judge’s Order and reasons in more detail when
    considering the various grounds of appeal advanced by Mr. Smith. At this point,
    I simply wish to note that the Order, broadly speaking, does three things: (i) it
    gives effect to the Second Letters of Request; (ii) it provides some directions
    regarding the implementation of the Second Letters of Request, including the
    scope of documentary production; and (iii) it sets out the procedure for the
    disposition and review of electronic devices belonging to Mr. Smith that are in
    the possession of the Toronto Police Service. In his application to enforce the
    Second Letters of Request, Mr. Peerenboom sought relief in respect of those
    devices. The parties asked the application judge for an order reflecting their
    agreement on the procedure concerning the devices, which he made at para. 62 of
    his reasons.</span></p>

    Smith filed his notice of appeal seeking to set aside the application judge’s Order
    in its entirety. The hearing of this appeal was expedited. The fresh evidence
    filed on consent discloses that (i) by order dated July 2, 2020 the Florida
    Court consolidated the Florida Main Action and the Florida Smith Action for
    discovery and trial, and (ii) by order dated July 14, 2020 the Court set the
    actions down for trial in January, 2021 and directed the parties to complete
    all discovery by the end of this year.</span></p>

    had “no trouble in finding that David Smith has relevant evidence to offer”: at
    para. 46. Mr. Smith does not challenge that finding; his challenge to the Order
    lies elsewhere. First, Mr. Smith submits that the application judge erred in
    concluding that the evidence sought through the Second Letters of Request was “not
    otherwise obtainable.” Mr. Smith contends that the application judge made two
    main errors in this regard:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>before he rendered his decision, the parties had
    informed the application judge that Mr. Smith’s jurisdictional appeal in the

    consider that, as a result, Mr. Smith’s evidence had become compellable by the
    respondents in the Florida proceedings; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>he failed to acknowledge that many of the

lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In his reasons, the
    application judge acknowledged counsel had informed him that Mr. Smith’s appeal
    of the jurisdictional decision in the Florida Smith Action had been dismissed.
    However, the application judge discounted the significance of that dismissal,
    stating, at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As it is, since the commencement of the
    hearing in this Court but before the submissions were complete, counsel advised
    that the Court in Florida has dismissed the appeal. In the circumstances there
    is no reason to believe that David Smith will agree to attend and be deposed in
    Florida. Certainly, his counsel had opportunities to disabuse the Court of this
    concern and did not do so. The second action, the one commenced by Harold
    Peerenboom against David Smith, does not stand as an alternative means of
    obtaining his evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s explanation for that
    conclusion is found in two places in his reasons. Earlier in para. 31, the
    application judge found:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>What is apparent from the bringing of the [jurisdictional]
    motion and the subsequent appeal is that David Smith is [loath] to appear in
    the United States to give that deposition. There is nothing in the record that
    indicates a willingness to attend. He has been acting in a manner consistent
    with an intention to avoid it. This concern was raised during the submissions
    made by counsel. What would happen if the appeal was turned down and the action
    against David Smith left to proceed? The prospect of a default judgment was
    raised, either by counsel for David Smith or without his objection. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The application judge
    returned to the point at para. 46, stating:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>David Smith has by his actions, motions and
    appeals made it clear that he is unwilling to respond to the procedures of the
    Florida Court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>I see no palpable and
    overriding error in the application judge’s finding that Mr. Smith was loath to
    appear in the United States to be deposed. That finding was reasonable based on
    the record of Mr. Smith’</span><span lang=EN-CA>s conduct, including his
    conduct since the issuance of the Second Letters of Request. </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Although Mr. Smith had moved to challenge
    the jurisdiction of the Florida Court and had been deposed on that motion, his jurisdictional
    motion was not construed as an attornment to the Florida Court and his
    deposition was limited to issues regarding the personal jurisdiction of the
    Florida Court. At the time the application judge rendered his decision, Mr.
    Smith had not voluntarily submitted to discovery on the merits of the Florida
    proceedings and his jurisdictional challenge had prevented the respondents from
    compelling his discovery in the Florida actions. Accordingly, on the record as
    it stood when he rendered his decision and based on Mr. Smith’s conduct to that
    point, it was open to the application judge to find as he did: that Mr. Smith
    was</span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> “[loath] to appear in the
    United States to give [a] deposition” and </span><span lang=EN-CA>by his
    actions had “made it clear that he is unwilling to respond to the procedures of
    the Florida Court.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Smith argues the
    application judge erred by failing to consider that his evidence was
    compellable in the Florida actions. Mr. Smith did not file any evidence before
    the motion judge explaining how, under Florida law, a court could compel a
    non-resident party like Mr. Smith to appear and give evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>New information not
    before the application judge was placed before this court on appeal. First, in response
    to a question from the court, Mr. Smith’s counsel advised that Mr. Smith had
    filed an answer or defence in the Florida Smith Action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Second, Mr. Smith filed
    a brief of “fresh evidence” containing two pieces of correspondence between
    counsel. There appears to be no dispute that Mr. Peerenboom’s Florida counsel
    served notices of examination on Mr. Smith for depositions this past June and
    August, which were cancelled by respondents’ counsel for a variety of reasons,
    including counsel’s health. A further notice has been sent for an October 6,
    2020 deposition of Mr. Smith.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Finally, Mr. Peerenboom
    also filed “fresh evidence” consisting of two pieces of correspondence between
    counsel. In an email dated April 7, 2020 Mr. Smith’s Florida counsel imposed
    several pre-conditions on Mr. Smith’s attendance at a deposition. The main
    pre-condition was that Mr. Smith would “not appear to be deposed unless and until
    the dangers and legal restrictions associated with coronavirus have been fully
    lifted by Canadian and American authorities.” Other conditions required that
    Mr. Peerenboom dismiss his Canadian lawsuits against Mr. Smith<a href="#_ftn2"

&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and limit questioning in the
    Florida action to areas of inquiry not covered in his deposition for the
    jurisdictional challenge motion. An August 19, 2020 email from Mr. Perlmutter’s
    Ontario counsel indicated that some of the cancellations of the previously
    noticed deposition of Mr. Smith resulted from the pre-conditions Mr. Smith had
    placed on his examination.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Although this new
    information provides further details about the litigation, in my view it does
    not undermine the conclusion reached by the application judge that Mr. Smith’s
    evidence was “not otherwise obtainable”. Mr. Smith remains resident in Ontario
    and counsels’ correspondence in the “fresh evidence” sheds no definitive light
    on whether Mr. Smith will appear for deposition in the Florida proceedings. Nor
    has Mr. Smith filed any evidence to explain how a Florida court can compel a
    party who is an Ontario resident to give evidence in a Florida action. A
    failure to attend for deposition might result in the striking out of any answer
    filed by Mr. Smith, but it would not result in the securing of his evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The availability of the information from
    other sources</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Smith argues that
    the application judge erred in holding that his evidence was “not otherwise
    obtainable” because many of the documents sought through the Second Letters of
    Request are obtainable by other measures, including directly from the parties
    themselves.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge explicitly addressed this
    issue at para. 46 of his reasons, stating:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence being sought from David Smith
    extends beyond his involvement in the sending of the package and the material
    it contained. That evidence indicates the possibility of his involvement in the
    alleged hate mail campaign. How far does that involvement reach? As will become
    apparent, the Letters of Request ask for any documents and communication
    between David Smith and a large number of other people including the
    Perlmutters and Harold Peerenboom. His counsel objects. Whatever communication
    there is between his client and the parties to the action within which the
    Letters of Request were issued, they would already have. Delivering hate mail,
    being part of a campaign to discredit anyone by spreading misinformation about
    another person (in this case the allegations include child molestation and
    murder) is a serious wrong. That is why it is a crime. It does not just affect
    those who are involved, it colours our society because it reflects on its
    values. The alleged involvement of David Smith in the sending of the material
    through UPS connects him to such activity. In this case, the involvement of
    David Smith is tied to the allegation that he conspired with others in the
    furtherance of this campaign. Hate mail and conspiracy are not, generally made
    accessible by those involved. These activities are not carried out where they
    are easily observed. The wide inquiry sought by the Florida Court through the
    Letters of Request makes it problematic to send the parties (Harold Peerenboom
    and the Perlmutters) to inquire of the array of people who may have received
    the hate mail if they have, and if the answer is yes, what communication of
    this kind they received, and then to determine what, if any of it involved
    David Smith. Harold Peerenboom may not be able to discern where the material
    came from, who was involved in preparing it and who was responsible for it
    being delivered. The nature of the Letters of Request makes clear the intention
    of the Court in Florida to shed light on the full breadth of the allegations.
    To fail to enforce them on the basis that any of this information was otherwise
    available would undermine that purpose. The information sought through these
    Letters of Request is not otherwise obtainable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The application judge’s
    analysis is sound. It is anchored in the scope of the dispute as set out in the
    Florida proceedings and the reality of the difficulties in establishing causes
    of action based on conspiracy and a wide-spread hate campaign. It also reflects
    what this court stated in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Lantheus</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, at para. 64: that evidence is not
    otherwise obtainable when “evidence of the same value as that sought from the

    directly relevant to the issue of Mr. Smith’s knowledge of, or participation in,
    the hate-mail campaign. One provision – Order para. 7(f) – does not reduce the
    scope of production expressly requested in the Second Letters of Request but
    appears designed to steer the parties away from a topic that, in the language

    judge was alive to the issue and, in fact, “went behind” the Second Letters of
    Request to some extent in order to address Mr. Smith’s complaints. In paras. 32
    and 35 of his reasons, the application judge examined at some length the
    process used by the Florida Court leading up to its issuance of the Second
    Letters of Request. He considered Mr. Smith’s complaint that Mr. Peerenboom did
    not file a separate motion, yet the Florida Court ultimately issued two Letters
    of Request, as well as his submission that no affidavit evidence supported the
    request to the Florida Court. His reasons clearly disclose that he was not
    persuaded the process tainted the Second Letters of Request such that it would
    be contrary to the interests of justice to enforce them. The application judge
    stated, in part, at paras. 34 and 35:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the case I am asked to decide, Judge
    Cymonie Rowe was concerned with the original form of the Letter of Request put
    to her. She asked that it be amended. It is apparent that she considered the
    substance of what she was being asked to do and the substance of the
    justification for that request (that is the concerns expressed on behalf of
    Harold Peerenboom). The form of the motion evolved, as motions do here and
    elsewhere. The response to her expressed concern was to put to her the two
    Letters of Request. There is no reason, nor would it be appropriate, for this
    Court to look behind the process adopted by the requesting Court.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This same analysis applies to a further
    objection made on behalf of David Smith. It was submitted that the decision to
    grant the Letters of Request was made without any evidence supporting the
    request … Counsel for the Perlmutters pointed out that the material supporting
    the application for the granting of the Letters of Request by the Court in
    Florida contains a reference to the source of every factual component of the
    request. This is evidence by another means. In considering the process utilized
    by the Florida Court the importance of comity, the deference, mutuality, and
    respect it calls for overrides the sort of technical concerns raised on behalf
    of David Smith.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Second, our
    jurisprudence recognizes that the procedural practices in the American state
    and federal district courts differ in some respects from those in Ontario. For
    example, some American courts issue letters of request in the absence of
    affidavit evidence: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Presbyterian Church, </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>at para. 11; and the scope of discovery in
    American civil proceedings generally is much broader than in Canada: </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Aker Biomarine</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>,
    at para. 27. Yet, comity requires that inflexible rules are not applied to such
    procedural differences. Instead, a Canadian court must balance any possible
    infringement of Canadian sovereignty with the natural desire to assist the
    courts of a foreign land: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Zingre</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, at p. 403. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, there is no evidence that the process
    which resulted in the issuance of the Second Letters of Request did not comply
    with the procedural rules of the issuing court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Finally, the process
    that led to the issuance of the Second Letters of Request lacks any hallmarks
    of an unfair process. In advance of moving before the Florida Court in late
    August 2018, the respondents invited Mr. Smith’s Ontario counsel to indicate
    which provisions in the Initial Letter of Request were overbroad. Mr. Smith’s
    counsel declined to do so. However, Mr. Smith’s Ontario counsel did request
    that certain facts be placed before the Florida Court for its consideration,
    which the respondents did. As well, the Perlmutter’s motion to the Florida
    Court to issue a further Letter of Request was made on notice to Mr. Smith.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In sum, I see nothing
    in the record to suggest the Second Letters of Request that issued from the
    process of the Florida Court would infringe on any recognized Canadian legal or
    moral principle: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>France (Republic) v. De Havilland
    Aircraft of Canada Ltd.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 705 (C.A.), at p. 719.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>For these reasons, I would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>X.      CONCLUSION ON THE APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>For the reasons set out
    above, I would dismiss the appeal from the Order.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>XI.     LEAVE TO APPEAL THE COSTS ORDER</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>A.      The issue stated</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>By order dated August
    5, 2020 (the “Costs Order”), the application judge ordered that “[e]ach party
    is required to bear its own costs of these Applications.” Mr. Smith seeks leave
    to appeal the Costs Order even if he does not succeed on his appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Smith submits that
    the discretionary Costs Order is tainted by two errors in principle or is
    plainly wrong: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Johnson v. Marzouca</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, 2016 ONCA 298, 130 O.R. (3d) 795, at
    para. 13. First, the application judge tethered the costs determination to the
    outcome of the Florida proceedings, effectively awarding “costs in the cause”
    for a proceeding that was not before him. Second, the application judge erred
    by departing from the general principle that non-party respondents to
    applications to enforce letters of request are entitled to receive their costs
    on an elevated scale regardless of the outcome of the enforcement application. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>B.      Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>I am not persuaded the
    application judge made any error in principle in making the Costs Order or that
    the order is plainly wrong. I would not grant leave to appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>First, it is clear on
    the face of the application judge’s reasons that he did not tether the Costs
    Order to the outcome of the Florida proceedings. Rather, he explained why the
    conduct of each party made it difficult for him to determine who was entitled
    to costs: Costs Reasons, at paras. 10-14. In his view, it was “not possible to
    meaningfully decide the issue of costs without knowing the ultimate results of
    the two [Florida] actions”: at para. 15. That did not lead him to order “costs
    in the cause,” as contended by Mr. Smith. On the contrary, his reasons, at
    para. 24, plainly disclose that he was </span><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-CA>not</span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> doing so:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The amounts related to activities in the Court
    in Florida will be assessed there, based on the law that applies. The
    differences that remain as a result of the work attributable to proceedings
    before this Court are not so great that anyone will be unduly prejudiced. Any
    suggestion that this should be left to be dealt with at the end, leaving this
    Court to unravel, understand and assess the result and impact of the Florida
    proceedings is neither appropriate nor practical.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>In the result, he
    ordered that in these Ontario applications “[t]here will be no order as to
    costs. Each party is to bear its own”: at para. 25. The application judge did
    not exceed his jurisdiction in making such order; it was squarely confined to
    the applications before him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Second, the case law
    discloses that on </span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>unsuccessful
    applications</span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> to enforce
    letters of request, courts have awarded the resisting respondent full indemnity
    costs, substantial indemnity costs, partial indemnity costs, or no costs: see
    the cases cited in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Oticon v. Gennum Corp.</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, 2010 ONSC 1638, [2010] O.J. No. 1082, at
    para. 3. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Scoular Co. v. Detlefsen</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, 2016 ONSC 4001, 92 C.P.C. (7th) 197, at
    paras. 44 to 51 Spies J. reviewed the costs awards in cases where the applicant </span><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>successfully enforced</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> letters of request. In those cases, the
    awards ranged from an order of partial indemnity costs to the successful
    applicant in one case, to an award of full indemnity costs to the unsuccessful
    respondent in another. In her case, Spies J. granted the application to enforce
    but ordered no costs of the application: at para. 53. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>The jurisprudence does
    not establish any bright line rule regarding the award of costs on successful
    applications to enforce letters of request. Consequently, the application judge
    did not err in principle in awarding no costs, nor was his Costs Order plainly
    wrong. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>For those reasons, I
    would not grant Mr. Smith leave to appeal the Costs Order. </span></p>

    Consultants Corporation, a company for which Mr. Smith had worked, has
