  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual interference, sexual exploitation,
    and sexual assault against the complainant, his stepdaughter. The complainant
    alleged that, over a period of several years beginning when she was in grade
    six or seven, the appellant required her to massage and crack his back. This
    occurred while the appellant lay on his bed. The complainant testified that the
    appellant touched her thighs and vagina once her brother left the room.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offences were alleged to have occurred while the complainant’s
    mother was at work. The complainant alleged that on one occasion, the appellant
    applied lotion to her legs and licked her vagina. She also alleged that the
    appellant touched her vagina through her jeans as they were watching a movie in
    a hotel room, while the complainant’s mother was taking a shower.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant informed the court that his request for leave to appeal
    sentence was abandoned. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raised several grounds of appeal against conviction in his
    factum, but focused on two issues at the hearing. The appellant says that the trial
    judge erred in admitting prior consistent statements and erred in relying on
    those statements for the proof of their contents.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have concluded that the prior consistent statements were properly
    admitted. However, as we will explain, we accept the appellant’s argument that
    the trial judge erred in relying on the prior consistent statements as proof
    the offences occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>Prior consistent statements were admitted properly </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge admitted evidence from a childhood friend of the
    complainant who testified that, when they were in grade six or seven, the complainant
    had told her that the appellant had come into her bedroom and assaulted her,
    and that they had discussed it a number of times after that. The complainant’s
    high school boyfriend testified that around 2012, while they were watching a movie
    that concerned sexual abuse, the complainant told him that the appellant had
    abused her.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant says that there was no allegation of recent fabrication
    that justified the admission of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that trial counsel for the appellant put the question of
    recent fabrication in play in the course of cross-examining the complainant. In
    particular, he suggested that she had made up the allegations because she was
    upset with certain events in her home life; that she was saying nasty things
    about the appellant because it was a way of getting back at the appellant and
    her mother; and that she got the idea to make allegations against the appellant
    from watching a movie with her boyfriend.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a result, it was open to the trial judge to use the complainant’s
    prior consistent statements to address the recent fabrication allegation and
    the suggestion that the complainant had a motive to lie about the appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the complainant’s childhood friend was inconsistent with
    the complainant’s, in that the friend said that the complainant told her the
    abuse occurred in her bedroom rather than in the appellant’s bedroom, but the
    trial judge explained why he considered this a minor detail. This was the trial
    judge’s call to make, and there is no basis to interfere with it on appeal.
    Although the childhood friend testified that the complainant spoke of a single
    incident rather than multiple incidents, as alleged by the complainant, her evidence
    was called in order to rebut the recent fabrication/motive to lie allegation,
    rather than to corroborate the complainant’s evidence. No further analysis was
    required.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The <i>W.(D.)</i> analysis</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in his <em>W.(D.)</em><i> </i>analysis by relying on the prior consistent statements for their truth in
    corroborating the complainant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree, and allow the appeal on this basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge properly instructed himself as to the requirements from <em>R.
    v. W.(D.)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742,</span></em> and provided reasons for rejecting the evidence of the appellant and for
    finding that the appellant’s evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt. He recognized
    that his rejection of the appellant’s evidence was insufficient to establish
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and went on to consider the evidence as a
    whole. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This case turned on credibility. The trial judge was entitled to use the
    evidence of the complainant’s prior consistent statements to rehabilitate her
    credibility, given the motives to lie and recent fabrications that trial
    counsel attributed to her. But once this was done, the trial judge had to
    determine that her evidence was credible without relying on the prior
    consistent statements for proof of their contents to corroborate the
    complainant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The key passage in the decision is this:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Counsel for [the appellant] also submitted to me that disbelief
    of the accused’s evidence does not satisfy the burden of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt. Again, I entirely agree. However, the vast majority of sexual
    assault prosecutions turn on the evidence of the two witnesses involved in the
    conduct alleged. <span class=Underline>Here there is not only evidence of [the
    complainant] about what occurred, but that she revealed it to a senior
    elementary school friend, her first boyfriend, her aunt, and her mother before
    going to the police. This reinforces my being satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt of the sexual contact and of the elements of the offences charged having
    occurred</span>.<i> </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that this passage must be read in light of the
    totality of the evidence and the rest of the trial judge’s analysis. The Crown
    says that the <em>W.(D.)</em> analysis was complete when the judge made these
    statements and the only issue remaining was whether the complainant’s evidence
    was credible or a fabrication. The trial judge had earlier concluded that the
    complainant’s evidence was reliable. According to the Crown, the trial judge
    used the prior consistent statements to neutralize the allegation of recent
    fabrication, allowing him to find that the complainant’s evidence was credible
    and so conclude that the appellant’s guilt had been established beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The difficulty with this analysis is that the trial judge’s reasons say
    otherwise. The trial judge specifically states that the complainant’s having
    revealed the abuse to several people – her friend, her boyfriend, her aunt, and
    her mother – “reinforces my being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This statement cannot fairly be read as limited to the rehabilitative
    effect of the prior consistent statements on the complainant’s credibility — a proper
    use to which the statements could have been put. The trial judge does not refer
    to the complainant’s alleged motive to lie or the recent fabrication allegation
    in discussing the prior consistent statements. Instead, after having said that
    most cases turn on the evidence of the two witnesses involved in the conduct
    alleged, the trial judge refers to the statements as reinforcing his conclusion
    that the offences occurred. In other words, the trial judge considered that
    this case was unusual in that there was evidence beyond that of the complainant
    and the appellant on which he could base his decision. This statement shows
    that, in determining whether the offences were proven beyond a reasonable
    doubt, the trial judge relied on the complainant’s prior consistent statements
