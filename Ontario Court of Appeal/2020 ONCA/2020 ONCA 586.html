  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the order of Justice Michelle
    O’Bonsawin of the Superior Court of Justice, dated July 12, 2019, with reasons
    reported at 2019 ONSC 4150, allowing an appeal from the stay of proceedings
    entered on December 7, 2018 by Justice Célynne S. Dorval of the Ontario Court
    of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant was charged with drug-impaired
    driving in October 2016. In December 2018, the trial judge held that his right
    to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the <em>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</em> had been infringed and stayed the proceedings. The
    Crown appealed. The summary conviction appeal judge allowed the Crown’s appeal,
    set aside the stay of proceedings, and ordered a new trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant now seeks leave to appeal to this
    court. With the consent of the parties, given that trial dates are set in this
    matter for October 2020, the panel heard the arguments on leave and the merits
    of the appeal together. For the following reasons, the application for leave to
    appeal is dismissed. Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of the appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Procedural History</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first few months after the applicant was
    charged with drug-impaired driving in October 2016, were taken up with the
    applicant’s requests for disclosure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In February 2017, the applicant’s trial counsel
    was appointed to the bench. In a court appearance on February 22, 2017, the applicant’s
    counsel’s agent requested an adjournment to review disclosure and reassign the
    file to other counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the next court appearance on March 1, 2017,
    the Crown suggested that trial dates should be set. The court offered March 7,
    2017, for the judicial pre-trial, but counsel’s agent asked for a later date,
    to allow new counsel to get up to speed on the file. The judicial pre-trial
    took place on March 21, 2017.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial dates were then set for May 7 and 8, 2018.
    The applicant was unavailable for April 2018 dates that were offered by the
    court. In December 2017, the Crown brought an application to set earlier trial
    dates, but the applicant was unavailable for February and March 2018 dates then
    offered by the court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 23, 2017, the applicant had asked for
    disclosure of the drug recognition expert’s rolling logs (“DRE logs”). DRE logs
    contain a record of every evaluation the DRE has been involved in before or
    after becoming certified as an expert. The Crown refused to disclose the DRE
    logs, arguing that they were not relevant and that their disclosure was
    prohibited by s. 258.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46
    (which has since been repealed) and would amount to a criminal offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant brought a motion for disclosure of
    the DRE logs by the Crown and the Ottawa Police Service, which was heard on
    April 19, 2018. On April 30, 2018, the trial judge ordered the disclosure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On May 7, 2018, the day the trial was scheduled
    to begin, the Crown advised the applicant that it intended to challenge the
    disclosure order by bringing an application for <em>certiorari</em>. The Crown
    refused to disclose the DRE logs at the same time as bringing the <em>certiorari</em> application, given its position that doing so was prohibited by the <em>Code</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s <em>certiorari</em> application was
    heard in May and July 2018. The <em>certiorari</em> judge took the decision
    under reserve.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the meantime, the applicant applied to the
    trial judge for a stay of proceedings, alleging that his right to be tried
    within a reasonable time had been infringed because the delay exceeded the
    18-month presumptive ceiling prescribed in <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27,
    [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631. The trial judge refused to hear the s. 11(b) application
    in September 2018 because the <em>certiorari</em> decision was outstanding. The
    application was adjourned to October 19, 2018. New trial dates were set for
    November 13 and 14, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 11, 2018, the <em>certiorari</em> judge dismissed the Crown’s application for <em>certiorari</em>, upholding the
    disclosure order. The Crown served a notice of appeal of the <em>certiorari</em> decision on November 5, 2018 and refused to disclose the DRE logs to the applicant
    pending the appeal, for the same reasons outlined above. The Ottawa Police
    Service likewise appealed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Through inadvertent error, the s. 11(b)
    application did not proceed on October 19, 2018, but was instead adjourned to
    November 13, 2018, the first scheduled day of trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge heard the s. 11(b) application
    on November 13, 2018, and on December 7, 2018, granted the application and
    stayed the proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown appealed. Before the appeal was heard,
    this court released its decisions in <em>R. v. Stipo</em>, 2019 ONCA 3, 144
    O.R. (3d) 145, and <em>R. v. Tsega</em>, 2019 ONCA 111, 144 O.R. (3d) 561. In <em>Stipo</em>,
    this court held that DRE logs are relevant and should be disclosed by the
    Crown, thereby resolving the disclosure dispute in this case in the applicant’s
    favour. In <em>Tsega</em>, this court provided guidance on the proper treatment
    of delay caused by applications for extraordinary remedies, including <em>certiorari</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The summary conviction appeal judge had the
    benefit of both these decisions in assessing how to treat the <em>certiorari</em> delay here, which comprised the bulk of the overall delay. The summary
    conviction appeal judge allowed the Crown’s appeal, set aside the stay of
    proceedings, and remitted the matter back to the Ontario Court of Justice for
    trial.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Discussion</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The test for leave to appeal in summary
    conviction proceedings is set out in in <em>R. v. R.(R.)</em><i> </i>(2008), 90
    O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 32:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Leave to appeal may be granted where the
    merits of the proposed question of law are arguable, even if not strong, and
    the proposed question of law has significance to the administration of justice
    beyond the four corners of the case. Leave to appeal may also be granted where
    there appears to be a “clear” error even if it cannot be said that the error
    has significance to the administration of justice beyond the specific case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant asserts that the summary
    conviction appeal judge erred in calculating delay in three ways:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>1.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> By deducting the time for the Crown’s <em>certiorari</em> application regarding the disclosure of the DRE logs;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> By using November 14, 2018 as the end-date for trial; and</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>3.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> By increasing by ten days the period of defence delay to
    accommodate a change in counsel when his first lawyer was appointed to the
    bench.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>All three issues are case-specific and do not
    have significance to the administration of justice beyond the four corners of
    this case. With respect to issue (1), we see no error in the summary conviction
    appeal judge’s application of the rule in <em>Tsega</em> for determining how to
    treat <em>certiorari</em> delay. Nor do we accept that there was a “clear”
    error in the calculation of delay for issues (2) and (3).</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Certiorari</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> Delay</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, we address the summary conviction appeal
    judge’s treatment of the delay caused by the Crown’s <em>certiorari</em> application and appeal of that ruling. The trial judge considered this issue
    before this court’s decision in <em>Tsega</em> was released in February 2019.
    She included the <em>certiorari</em> delay within the overall calculation of
    delay on the basis that the applicant remained charged during that period and
    was entitled to his s. 11(b) right. She went on to find that in the event she
    was in error, the <em>certiorari</em> delay was not an exceptional
    circumstance. She viewed the Crown’s decision to pursue the <em>certiorari</em> remedy when the issue was soon to be resolved by this court in <em>Stipo</em> as a tactical or policy decision taken without considering the applicant’s
    right to a trial within a reasonable time, and that it went beyond mere
    complacency towards delay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, the summary conviction appeal judge
    had the benefit of this court’s decision in <em>Tsega</em>, which set out at
    para. 82 the test for determining whether <em>certiorari</em> delay should be
    counted in the overall delay or excluded as an exceptional circumstance:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]n determining whether delay caused by a
    Crown application should be excluded from the delay calculation, the reviewing
    judge must recognize the Crown’s discretion to take such steps and limit the
    analysis to a consideration of whether the Crown’s actions were frivolous,
    undertaken in bad faith, or executed in a dilatory manner. A frivolous
    application is one which has no arguable basis. Again, by conducting the
    analysis on this basis, the court is fulfilling its <em>Jordan</em> imposed
    obligation of ensuring that all justice participants are acting responsibly and
    ensuring that the accused’s right to be tried within a reasonable time is
    respected.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The summary conviction appeal judge had also
    previously heard and dismissed the Crown’s <em>certiorari</em> application in
    this case. She concluded, at paras. 23-24 that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In this matter, there is no evidence to
    support a finding that the Crown’s actions were frivolous, undertaken in bad
    faith, or executed in a dilatory manner. I agree with the Crown’s argument that
    the consequence of compliance with these orders, if it was in error, was a
    commission of a criminal offence contrary to s. 258.1(5) of the <em>Code</em>.
    The third party [Ottawa Police Service] also sought a review which led to a
    delay which was inevitable regardless of the Crown’s position.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown was unsuccessful in the <em>certiorari</em><i> </i>proceedings. However, the question to be considered is not whether the
    Crown was successful in its <em>certiorari</em><i> </i>proceedings, but rather
    whether it was reasonable for the Crown to pursue this remedy. At this period
    of time, <em>Stipo</em><i> </i>had been argued before the Court of Appeal but a
    decision had not yet been rendered. The court only issued its reasons in <em>Stipo</em><i> </i>on January 7, 2019. Overall, I find the Crown’s actions were reasonable and
    they were neither frivolous, undertaken in bad faith, nor executed in a
    dilatory manner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this application for leave to appeal, the
    applicant raises three proposed questions of law with respect to the <em>certiorari</em> delay: whether the Crown could have provided the logs and pursued its <em>certiorari</em> application at the same time; whether the delay was inevitable when a third
    party state actor was also challenging the production of the logs as third
    party records; and whether the Crown was acting in a dilatory manner.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We see no error of law committed by the summary
    conviction appeal judge. She was fully aware of the facts and the arguments and
    applied the <em>Tsega</em> criteria directly. Even if there is a question of
    law raised here, it is not of significance beyond this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the applicant challenges the
    determination by the summary conviction appeal judge that the entire period of
    192 days from the date the Crown advised that it would pursue a <em>certiorari</em> application (May 7, 2018) to the end-date of trial (November 14, 2018) should
    be deducted. He argues that the time should only run from the actual date of
    the application (May 9, 2018) to the date of the <em>certiorari</em> decision
    (October 11, 2018), and from November 5, 2018 (the day the Crown appealed the <em>certiorari</em> decision) to November 14, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This issue again does not warrant granting leave
    to appeal. It has no significance beyond this case, and we are not persuaded
    that the summary conviction appeal judge’s calculation of the <em>certiorari</em>-related
    delay reveals any clear error of law. During the whole period, the <em>certiorari</em> proceedings were still ongoing, the Crown was still refusing to disclose, and
    the matter could not have moved forward for those reasons. This was reasonably
    calculated as “the time taken for extraordinary remedies and appeals therefrom”; <em>Tsega</em>, at paras. 77,79.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, we address the issue of the anticipated
    end-date of trial. The submission is that the summary conviction appeal judge
    erred in identifying November 14, 2018 as the end-date for the purpose of
    calculating the overall delay because that date was not the “actual or
    anticipated end of trial”: <em>Jordan</em>, at para.&nbsp;49. The trial did not
    end on this date, and neither of the parties anticipated that it would.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no clear error here. Both before the
    trial judge and the summary conviction appeal judge, the applicant relied on
    November 13, 2018 as the applicable end-date, arguing that the delay as of that
    point was unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant’s trial was scheduled to take
    place on November 13 and 14, 2018. The trial did not proceed on November 13 and
    14, 2018 because of the continuing dispute about the Crown’s obligation to
    disclose the DRE logs. By November 13 and 14, 2018, this disclosure was outstanding.
    The applicant was unwilling to proceed to trial without the DRE logs, and the
    trial judge declined to force the applicant to do so. Instead, on November 13,
    2018, the parties made oral submissions on the s. 11(b) application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge used February 4 and 5, 2019 as
    the end-dates in calculating the overall delay. She incorrectly assumed that
    the trial had been scheduled for February 2019. The applicant’s position was
    that the ceiling had been breached as of the date of argument of the s. 11(b)
    application. November 13, 2018. Counsel used that date as the end-date for the
    purpose of calculating the overall delay, arguing that, although November 13,
    2018 was “clearly not the end of the trial … that’s the date we’re going to
    work with”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, the applicant flagged for the summary
    conviction appeal judge that the trial judge had erred in relying on February 4
    and 5, 2019 in calculating the overall delay. The summary conviction appeal
    judge selected November 14, 2018 as the anticipated end of trial, noting, at
    para. 13, the applicant’s concession that the trial judge erred by listing the
    anticipated trial dates as February 4 and 5, 2019, while the actual trial dates
    were set for November 13 and 14, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appropriate end-date was not argued before
    the summary conviction appeal judge in oral submissions. In written
    submissions, the applicant again relied on November 13, 2018 as the end-date
    for the purpose of the overall delay calculation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Throughout the litigation below, the parties
    accepted that the appropriate end-date for the purpose of calculating the
    overall delay was November 13, 2018, and while the applicant observed that the
    trial did not in fact end in November 2018, counsel did not argue that the
    summary conviction appeal judge should rely on any other date.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, we note that the applicant has not
    proposed any other date that this court should rely on as the end-date for the
    purpose of calculating the overall delay (other than to suggest before this
    court a “Crown-friendly” estimate of adding an additional 30 days of delay).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The absence of any identifiable end-date for the
    trial in this case reflects the fact that the applicant chose to proceed with
    his s. 11(b) application at a time when the procedural future of the matter was
    uncertain, because the Crown’s <em>certiorari</em> appeal was pending. The
    applicant argued that the delay was already unreasonable as of the date of the
    application. Given the applicant’s position before the trial judge and the
    summary conviction appeal judge, and the complex procedural history of the
    matter, it would not have been appropriate for the summary conviction appeal
    judge, and is not appropriate for this court, to speculate when the applicant’s
    trial might have concluded had the charge not been stayed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In these circumstances, given the positions of
    the parties before the trial judge and the summary conviction appeal judge, the
    summary conviction appeal judge did not make a “clear error” in relying on
    November 14, 2018, as the end&#8209;date for the purpose of calculating delay.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unnecessary to address the merits of the
    applicant’s next argument, that the summary conviction appeal judge erred by
    disturbing the trial judge’s quantification of delay for when new counsel came
    on board (increasing the delay from 14 to 24 days). Standing alone, this
    ten-day period is insufficient to affect the result. Given our conclusion that
    leave should not be granted on the <em>certiorari</em> and end-date issues,
    even if the summary conviction appeal judge erred in interfering with the trial
    judge’s characterization of these ten days, that would not affect the result.
    The summary conviction appeal judge identified 515 days of net delay. The
    applicant argues for a stay only on the basis that the delay exceeded the
    presumptive ceiling of 18 months (which is 547 days). Adding ten days to the
    net delay would not put this matter over the ceiling.</span></p>
