lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In December 2019, the appellant was convicted of
    sexual assault, forcible confinement and assault by Gorman J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice following a trial in Windsor. In February 2020, the appellant
    received a custodial sentence of two years less a day and s. 109 firearms (10
    years) and SOIRA (20 years) orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals the convictions and the
    sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and the complainant met on
    Instagram and then in person. The appellant was 19 years old and the
    complainant was 17 years old.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 21, 2017, the appellant and the
    complainant were arguing by text message about the complainant’s plan to attend
    a local festival. The appellant invited the complainant to his house to
    continue the discussion in person. Later, they went, along with friends, to a
    bowling alley. At the end of the evening, the complainant drove the appellant back
    to his house and she accepted his invitation inside.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Once inside, the appellant and the complainant
    went to the appellant’s bedroom. According to the complainant, she agreed to
    cuddle but within a few minutes the appellant was trying to have sex. She
    refused. The appellant tried to take off her clothes and kept telling her that
    he wanted to have sex. She tried to push off the appellant but he told her to
    stop fighting because he was stronger. He put his penis in her vagina and told
    her that she was not allowed to leave and not permitted to go to the festival.
    He began wrestling with her, held her hands above her head, and called her
    names.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant then heard a text alert and
    asked the appellant to permit her to respond to it or to go to the bathroom.
    The appellant told her again that she was not allowed to leave. She was
    sobbing. The appellant’s parents entered the room, told the appellant to give
    the complainant her clothes, and told the complainant she could leave the room.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s father walked the complainant to
    the door. She told him that she would not press charges. She testified that she
    said this because she thought she would not otherwise be allowed to leave.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found the complainant to be
    “entirely credible … her evidence [was] internally consistent and not [overreaching].”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified at the trial. The trial
    judge said this about his testimony:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I found the accused to be incredulous. On many
    occasions he went out of his way in an effort to paint [the complainant] in a
    negative light. His testimony that she was drinking at the bowling alley,
    driving poorly, and that she banged her head while exiting the vehicle was
    entirely self-serving.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Against this backdrop of her assessments of the
    two principal witnesses, the trial judge convicted the appellant of the three
    offences with which he had been charged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, assisted by duty counsel,
    advances three arguments on the conviction appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant points out that the
    complainant was 17, a child, when the alleged sexual assault, confinement, and
    assault took place. She was 19, an adult, when she testified at the trial. In
    her reasons, the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>With these principles in mind, it should be
    noted that [the complainant] was 17 years old at the time of the allegations.
    While not a very young child, she was a child nonetheless. As the court stated
    in <em>R. v. B.(G.)</em>, [1990] CarswellSask 20, at para. 56:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>While children may not be able to recount
    precise details and communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude,
    this does not mean that they have misconceived what happened to them and who
    did it.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Applying the law to the evidence, I found [the
    complainant] to be entirely credible. She testified about matters that occurred
    two years ago when she was 17 years old. I agree with the submission of the
    Crown that she did her best. I found her evidence to be internally consistent
    and not [overreaching].</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on this passage, the appellant contends
    that the trial judge erred by giving the complainant testimonial latitude on
    account of her age by improperly treating her as a child witness when, in fact,
    she testified as an adult.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not persuaded by this submission. In our
    view, in this passage the trial judge was simply stating that the complainant
    was a child – and indeed “not a very young child” – when the assaults and
    confinement occurred; she was not saying that the complainant was a child when
    she testified or that she was treating the complainant’s testimony as that of a
    child witness. All the trial judge said, accurately, was: “[The complainant]
    testified about matters that occurred two years ago when she was 17 years old.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant submits that the age
    difference between the appellant (19 at the time of the events) and complainant
    (17) led to the trial judge applying a different standard of scrutiny to their
    evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not accept this submission. It is anchored
    in the same assertion as that made in the appellant’s first ground of appeal:
    the trial judge treated the complainant as a child witness. Since we have
    rejected that assertion, it follows that we are satisfied that the trial judge
    considered the appellant’s and the complainant’s testimony in a proper and
    balanced fashion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge erred in finding collusion between the appellant and his parents, both of
    whom testified.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
