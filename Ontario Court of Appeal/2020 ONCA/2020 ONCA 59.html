lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Humberto Dapena Huerta, was
    indicted on eight counts arising from six incidents involving six complainants.
    The charges included criminal harassment, sexual assault, and sexual
    interference. All six incidents took place within a radius of 2.7 kilometres,
    which includes downtown Richmond Hill.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The central issue at trial was the identity of
    the perpetrator.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s theory was that Mr. Huerta loitered
    near schools and parks in Richmond Hill to run at and grope young-looking
    women.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Each of the six complainants testified. The
    Crown was permitted to lead cross-count similar fact evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown also led evidence of three educators
    (the “educators”) who claimed they saw a man near the school they worked at who
    resembled the composite sketch released by the York Regional Police. The
    composite was prepared with the assistance of one of the complainants, J.A. At
    least two of the three educators testified that the man resembled the
    composite, he was a suspicious person, and they called 9-1-1 as a result.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the trial, Mr. Huerta conceded he was the

  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>N.F. was 16 years old. She was walking in a
    residential area when she noticed a man standing near a car, who began
    following her. The man walked away from her but when she glanced back, she saw
    him running toward her. N.F. began to cry and called her mother. The
    perpetrator never got closer than a metre from her and she only saw him in
    profile.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.C. was 51 years old but could have been
    mistaken for a much younger person due to her small stature. J.C. was walking
    near a high school. She noticed a man across the street and soon thereafter,
    heard someone running behind her. A man grabbed her and wrapped his arms around
    her abdomen. He slipped on the snow and they both fell to the ground while he
    was still holding her tightly. J.C. was on top of the man with her back to his
    front, the man pushed her aside, said “sorry” and left. J.C. did not get a good
    view of his face.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.A. was 15 years old. She was walking to a
    school and saw a man jogging toward her. She tried to get out of the way, but
    he grabbed her aggressively around the waist and tried to push her to the ground.
    When he was unable to push her to the ground, he lifted up her skirt, touched
    her upper thigh, and jogged away. J.A. said she was “face-to-face with the man”
    just before he grabbed her and got a “relatively good look at his face.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The two charges of sexual interference and
    sexual assault involving J.A. must result in acquittals, as the lack of facial
    pockmarks is both significant and exculpatory. Moreover, the only other
    evidence proffered by J.A. was generic: that the perpetrator was Caucasian,
    five feet ten inches tall, of medium build, and in his late 40s to early 50s.
    She made no observations about a car.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While some of the generic evidence J.A. provided
    is similar to generic evidence of other witnesses, J.A. described the
    perpetrator as having distinctive features, which Mr. Huerta does not have. The
    cumulative effect of the following facts leads to the conclusion that there is
    insufficient evidence upon which the jury could have been satisfied of Mr.
    Huerta’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and convicted on the charges of sexual
    interference and sexual assault of J.A.:</span></p>

    proceeding, was approached by the perpetrator from the front and she said she
    got a good look at him;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Huerta does not have any pockmarks on his
    cheeks.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An order is therefore made quashing the
    convictions of sexual interference and sexual assault of J.A. and entering
    acquittals on those two counts.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The convictions in respect of N.F. and J.C. rest
    largely on generic evidence: that is, that the perpetrator was a Caucasian
    male, in his 40s to 50s, about five feet ten inches to five feet eleven inches
    tall, with greyish hair, and wearing sunglasses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Both N.F. and J.C. testified that they did not
    get a good look at the perpetrator. N.F. testified that she only saw the
    perpetrator in profile and never from closer than one metre away. J.C.
    testified that she did not get a good look at the perpetrator.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, some of the features of the “older
    Japanese car” described by N.F. are not consistent with the car Mr. Huerta was
    driving. The rust was not on the doors as N.F. testified, nor did it have
    tinted windows, winter tires, or black rims. It had all-season tires with
    silver rims, the windows were not tinted, and the rust was not on the doors but
    on the rear fender close to the tire. Moreover, a little more than a month
    after the incident, N.F. reported to the police that she had seen the same car
    which was “very recognizable to [her]” but it belonged to another person; N.F.
    conceded that there could have been another, very similar car in the area on
    the day of the incident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, cross-count similar fact evidence was
    admitted on the premise that the same person likely committed all of the
    offences charged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Where similar fact evidence is allowed, the
    trier of fact may use the evidence from one count on which there was an
    acquittal to assess an accused’s liability on other counts: <em>R. v. Arp</em>,
    [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 79; <em>R. v. Mahalingan</em>, 2008 SCC 63,
    [2008] 3 S.C.R. 316, at paras. 66-72.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This evidence however, is exculpatory in many
    respects, as it attributes distinctive features to the perpetrator not shared
    by the appellant, such as a moustache, Russian accent, and pockmarks.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, looking at all of the
    evidence, there is insufficient evidence upon which a reasonable jury could be
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the perpetrator of
    the offences involving N.F. or J.C. I would therefore enter acquittals on those
    counts as well.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the above reasons, I would substitute
    acquittals on each of the four counts on which the appellant was convicted.</span></p>
