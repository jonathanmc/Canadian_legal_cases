  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In June 2019, the appellant was convicted of
    sexual assault by Knott J. of the Ontario Court of Justice following a trial in
    Brockville. In September 2019, the appellant received a custodial sentence of
    14 months plus three years probation, a ten year weapons prohibition and a 20
    year SOIRA order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals the conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, complainant and four other people
    went to a cottage for a weekend. The appellant and complainant did not know
    each other prior to this weekend. The complainant was married; her husband did
    not come to the cottage. A great deal of alcohol was consumed by the attendees,
    including the appellant and the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and the complainant went to sleep
    in different bedrooms. At some time during the night, the appellant went to the
    washroom to vomit. He then went to the complainant’s bedroom and got into her
    bed. He testified that he did not see anyone else in the bed when he entered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that she awoke to a
    man having intercourse with her. She initially thought it might have been a
    dream or her husband. She pushed the person off her and, along with other
    occupants of the cottage who were now awake, confronted the appellant, while
    making a recording of part of the confrontation. Due to her intoxication, there
    were certain gaps in her memory of the events, including how and when she went
    to the bedroom. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified that he awoke to the
    complainant hugging him from behind and touching his penis. He said that the
    complainant flipped him over and initiated intercourse. The intercourse ended
    after a couple of minutes and he went back to sleep.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons, the trial judge rejected the
    accused’s evidence. He found that it was contradicted by the complainant’s
    evidence, her description of his post-conduct behaviour, the recorded
    confrontation, and the accused’s conversation with one of the other men at the
    cottage. At no point on the recording or in his conversation with that man did
    the accused say that the complainant initiated the intercourse or profess his
    innocence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge said that he had a doubt as to
    whether the accused entered the bedroom knowing that it was occupied. He found
    that the complainant was awakened by a man engaging in sexual intercourse with
    her. He concluded that the complainant did not consent to intercourse: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I accept the complainant’s evidence without a
    reasonable doubt that she was awakened by a man engaging in sexual intercourse
    with her. She pushed the man off her. She may have thought the man was her husband
    then may have guessed it was [one of the other men at the cottage]. She did not
    know it was the accused who was engaging in sexual intercourse until she saw
    the accused at the end of the bed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge considered whether the accused
    had an honest but mistaken belief with respect to the complainant’s consent. He
    determined that the defence was not available to the accused because any such
    belief was anchored in his own self-induced intoxication. The trial judge also
    found that the accused did not take reasonable steps to make sure that the
    complainant was awake, knew she was engaging in sexual activity, and with whom.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this appeal, the appellant advances two
    grounds of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant contends that the trial
    judge erred by rejecting the defence of an honest but mistaken belief in
    consent on account of reasonable steps not being taken to ascertain consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not accept this submission. We see no
    error with the trial judge’s approach to reasonable steps. The trial judge concluded
    that the appellant “took no steps to ensure [the complainant] was awake and
    aware of what was going to transpire. He took no steps to ensure she knew, in
    the dark of the room, that she was having sexual intercourse with the accused.”
    The appellant did not point to any evidence that would undermine the trial
    judge’s conclusion on this issue. This conclusion is owed deference. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge erred in rejecting the defence of an honest but mistaken belief in consent
    on account of self-induced intoxication.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not persuaded by this submission. The
    trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>He was drunk. He knew she was drunk.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I do not expect some drunken man to take all
    reasonable steps such as turning on the lights and having a full and frank
    discussion about what they were about to engage in, but the accused took no
    steps.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>But the accused’s defence that the complainant
    consented to the sexual activity was due to his own self-induced intoxication,
    and he did not take reasonable steps in the circumstances, known to him at the
    time, to ascertain the complainant was consenting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, this was a full and sound
    assessment of the defence presented by the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant is on bail pending appeal. At the
    hearing, the parties agreed that he would surrender into custody when the court
    provided notice of the release of its decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is dismissed. </span></p>
