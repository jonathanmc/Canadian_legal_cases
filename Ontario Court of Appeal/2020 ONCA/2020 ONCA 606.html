  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>overview                                                                               </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This is an application under s. 680 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> for an order directing a review of the order of O’Marra J. (the “bail
    judge”) made pursuant to s. 522 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, dismissing the
    applicant’s (“Jaser”) application for bail pending his retrial and, if a review
    is directed, for an order releasing Jaser on bail pending his retrial. The
    Chief Justice designated me to hear the application to direct a review. Pursuant
    to s. 680(2), the parties have agreed I can exercise the review powers assigned
    to the court, should I direct a review. The application proceeded by way of a
    single hearing before me in which the motion to direct a review and the actual
    review were argued together.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The bail judge found Jaser had failed to show
    his detention was not necessary for the protection or safety of the public, or
    to maintain the public confidence in the administration of justice. On this application,
    Jaser alleges material, factual and legal errors by the bail judge. Jaser also
    offers evidence on the application that was not before the bail judge. He
    submits this court should receive that evidence as it will materially affect
    the bail calculus. Jaser submits a proper application of the applicable bail
    principles to the entirety of the record compels the conclusion Jaser is
    entitled to be released pending his retrial, albeit on strict terms amounting
    to house arrest.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown resists Jaser’s application. Although
    the Crown accepts some of the new evidence should be received on review, the
    Crown argues the evidence does not materially impact on Jaser’s entitlement to
    bail. The Crown further contends the bail judge made no legal or factual errors.
    The Crown submits, stripped to its essentials, Jaser’s application comes down
    to an attempt to secure a <em>de novo</em> bail hearing under the guise of a s.
    680 review. The Crown argues a review should not be directed and, in any event,
    the detention order should stand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I direct a review
    of the detention order and will make an order releasing Jaser pending his
    retrial, assuming adequate terms can be fashioned after further submissions
    from counsel. As I will explain, the bail judge made material errors warranting
    intervention. Having regard to the record on the bail hearing, and the new
    evidence I would receive, Jaser has satisfied me his release on very strict
    terms will adequately address the legitimate public safety and public confidence
    concerns associated with his release on bail pending his retrial. I will hear
    further submissions with a view to fixing suitable terms.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This prosecution has a lengthy history. The applicant
    (“Jaser”) and the co-accused (“Esseghaier”) were charged with terrorist-related
    offences in April 2013. The events giving rise to the charges occurred in August
    and September of 2012. The Crown preferred an indictment in the Superior Court
    in September 2013.  </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In November 2013, Jaser unsuccessfully applied in
    the Superior Court, pursuant to s. 522 of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In March 2015, the jury convicted Esseghaier on
    all five counts. The jury convicted Jaser on counts 2, 3 and 4, but could not
    agree upon a verdict on count 1. On September 23, 2015, the trial judge sentenced
    Jaser to life imprisonment on count 2 (conspiracy to commit murder for the
    benefit of a terrorist group). He imposed sentences of five and eight years on
    counts 3 and 4. Those sentences were made consecutive to each other, as
    required by statute, and concurrent to the life sentence imposed on count 2.
    Esseghaier received concurrent life sentences on counts 1 and 2: <em>R. v.
    Esseghaier</em>, 2015 ONSC 5855.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Jaser and Esseghaier appealed. They raised
    several grounds, including an argument the jury selection process contravened
    the mandatory provisions of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Jaser and Esseghaier,
    relying on authorities from this court post-dating their trial, argued the
    challenge for cause process at trial failed to comply with the provisions of
    the <em>Criminal Code</em>. They further argued this non-compliance meant the
    court was improperly constituted and the verdicts must be set aside, without
    regard to the conduct of the rest of the trial, or the weight of the evidence. Watt
    J.A. directed the appeal bifurcated and the jury selection issue addressed
    first in a separate hearing. In August 2019, the court allowed the appeal,
    holding that the jury selection process did contravene the requirements of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>. The court ordered a new trial and did not address the other ground
    of appeal: <em>R. v. Esseghaier</em>, 2019 ONCA 672.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to
    appeal in February 2020. The hearing of the appeal is tentatively scheduled for
    October 7, 2020. If the Crown appeal succeeds in the Supreme Court of Canada,
    the appeal will have to be remitted to this court for consideration of the
    other grounds of appeal. There is also the likelihood of collateral litigation
    in the Federal Court arising out of national security privilege claims advanced
    by the Crown in respect of certain information relied on to obtain
    authorizations to intercept private communications.</span></p>

    life imprisonment, he will have been eligible for day parole as of April 2020,
    at least a year before the retrial. He will be eligible for full parole in
    October 2022.</span></p>

    September and the three men met several times. They spoke of the train plot and
    visited potential sights where a VIA train might be derailed. They discussed
    Tamer’s role in bringing about the derailment and publicizing the purpose of
    the derailment after it had occurred. In some of these discussions, Jaser also
    spoke of the sniper plot, which he saw as a more effective way to terrorize the
    community.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 24, 2012, Jaser, Esseghaier and
    Tamer visited a bridge on the VIA rail line and discussed, in some detail, how
    the bridge could be blown up to derail a VIA passenger train. The three men
    were sitting in their vehicle in a parking lot when two police officers
    approached the car. Someone had reported seeing the three men walking along the
    tracks. The officers requested identification. Jaser, Esseghaier and Tamer produced
    their identification and told the police they had been looking at the scenery when
    they became lost. The officers left. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Jaser became convinced the plot to blow up the
    bridge and derail the VIA train was fatally compromised once the police were
    aware Jaser and Esseghaier had been on the bridge. In discussions with Esseghaier
    and Tamer, Jaser spoke of finding a new location for the derailment plot. He
    also repeatedly, and in strong terms, reiterated his belief the random murder
    of prominent members of the community, especially Jewish persons, would more
    effectively terrorize the community by striking at “high value targets”. </span></p>

    any of the plots by the end of September. Jaser was not arrested until April
    2013, however, there was no evidence of any discussions about the plots or any
    other terrorist activity between Jaser and Esseghaier after the end of
    September. Jaser remained under police surveillance until he was arrested.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s case rests primarily on
    interceptions of private communications among Jaser, Esseghaier and Tamer,
    physical surveillance placing them at certain sights, and the testimony of
    Tamer, the undercover agent. On their face, the communications provide powerful
    evidence supporting the Crown’s case. Jaser spoke like a committed terrorist
    determined to kill as many people as he could in a way that would maximize the
    harm caused to the peace, security and safety of the Canadian community. According
    to these conversations, Jaser detested Canadian society and the Canadian way of
    life. He cared nothing for the lives of others or his own life. Jaser embraced the
    glory of martyrdom. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown did not allege any connection between
    Jaser and any other terrorist supporter other than Esseghaier. Nor did the
    Crown point to any activity by Jaser allegedly connected to any radical group
    or terrorist plot outside of the activities with Esseghaier and Tamer in August
    and September 2012. Apart from the conversations among the three men, and their
    visits to various locations along the railway line, the Crown adduced no
    evidence of any overt act by Jaser in furtherance of the conspiracy. The Crown offered
    no evidence of Jaser’s actual ability to initiate and implement any of the
    plots discussed with Esseghaier.</span></p>

    was to defraud Tamer, who he believed to be a rich real estate developer ready
    to fund terrorist- related activity. As counsel succinctly put it at trial, “Jaser
    was a fraudster, not a terrorist.” In support of that claim, the defence
    pointed to conversations between Jaser and Tamer in which Jaser spoke of
    potential business opportunities to be funded by Tamer. According to the

    Emirates. His family came to Canada as refugee claimants in 1993. Jaser is
    presently a permanent resident of Canada, but after he was convicted of the terrorist-related
    offences, the authorities commenced proceedings to remove that status.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Jaser was convicted of failing to comply with a
    recognizance in 1997. Later in 1997, he was convicted of several counts of
    fraud, attempted fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, and an additional count of
    breach of recognizance. In 2001, he was convicted of uttering threats.<a

    his arrest in 2013, Jaser regularly engaged in fraudulent activity, and when
    under court orders disobeyed those orders. He even cheated members of his own
    family. Jaser had little, if any, gainful employment. As matters stood when
    Jaser was arrested in 2013, his personal history and character made him a bad bail
    candidate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to 2009, Jaser showed no interest in Islam.
    His lifestyle, which included excessive use of drugs and alcohol, was hardly
    consistent with that of an observant Muslim. In 2009, Jaser appeared to develop
    an interest in Islam. He adopted Islamic religious practices and took on the
    appearances of an observant Muslim. His parents did not think these changes
    reflected any actual change in their son’s belief system. The Crown maintained
    Jaser’s interest in religion had, by the summer of 2012, mutated into a
    commitment to jihadist terrorism. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the s. 522 bail hearing, Jaser put a great
    deal of information before the bail judge in an effort to show he was a
    fundamentally different person in 2020 than he was in 2013. The evidence in
    support of this claim came from Jaser, his family members, and the records from
    various correctional institutions where Jaser had lived in the seven years
    since his arrest. The corrections records described Jaser as cooperative, amenable
    to therapy and counselling, including anger management, and motivated to make
    positive changes in his life. Jaser appeared to be strongly invested in various
    counselling and rehabilitative programs offered in the penitentiary system. According
    to the reports, he remains anxious to continue down the road of
    self-improvement. Jaser has also upgraded his education and technical skills.
    The correctional authorities had no evidence of any attempt by Jaser to involve
    himself in the radicalization of other inmates while he was in custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The corrections reports were not, however, entirely
    positive. In the March 2018 report recommending Jaser’s transfer to a medium
    security penitentiary, the reports described him as “highly egocentric” with a “proclivity
    to manipulate others for personal gain”, a “pervasive lack of empathy”, and a
    “grossly inflated” sense of self-worth. The report did acknowledge some positive
    strides in addressing these significant character and behavioural deficiencies. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Jaser did not initially participate in any
    religious programming or counselling while in custody. However, as time went
    by, he began to attend some sessions. His interest and participation in those
    sessions grew. According to those who conducted the sessions, Jaser appeared very
    remorseful, although it is not entirely clear what he was remorseful about. Jaser’s
    religious counsellors also indicated Jaser used his faith to gain insights into
    his behaviour and improve himself as a person. He became a regular attendant at
    religious functions and is highly thought of by the imams who presided over his
    religious sessions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Jaser was not close to his family prior to his
    arrest in 2013. Indeed, they were among the victims of his frauds. He routinely
    lied to his parents. There was no evidence Jaser’s parents or brother, the
    proposed sureties, had any ability to control or even influence Jaser’s
    behaviour as of his arrest in 2013.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Since his arrest, Jaser has forged much closer
    connections with his family. They have maintained regular contact with him,
    despite significant limitations on their abilities to do so while Jaser is in
    custody. </span></p>

    or by way of any affidavit, he did not hold jihadist terrorist beliefs in 2012.
    Nor has he offered any testimony about his present beliefs. His religious
    instructors have offered no evidence of any conversations in which Jaser
    disavowed any jihadist beliefs, either in 2012 or at any subsequent time. There
    is no direct evidence post-dating Jaser’s arrest of any changes in Jaser’s
    belief system. </span></p>

    Jaser of current jihadist beliefs, counsel referred to a single answer given by
    Jaser at the bail hearing. Jaser was asked by his counsel about his reaction when
    he listened to his diatribes promoting mass murder in the intercepted
    communications. In a response I can only describe as ambivalent, given his
    “pretending to agree” defence at trial, Jaser replied:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I felt like a rollercoaster really. There’s

    to the proposed release plan, which included house arrest and electronic

    Canada, the bail judge said, at para. 40:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I am satisfied there is little likelihood that

    had shown his detention was not necessary for the protection or safety of the
    public as required in s. 515(10)(b). In coming to that conclusion, the bail
    judge described Jaser as a long-time manipulator and liar, prepared to assume
    whatever role he deemed to be to his advantage. The bail judge referred to correctional
    records, which he read as indicating that Jaser had significant psychological
    and behavioural deficiencies and presented a risk to the public. Finally, the
    bail judge expressed concern about the ability of Jaser’s parents to
    effectively control and supervise his conduct were he released on bail. The
    bail judge was not satisfied the proposed electronic monitoring could overcome
    those concerns.</span></p>

    the statutory provisions and referring to the controlling case law, the bail
    judge examined the specific factors identified in s. 515(10)(c). He concluded,

    Law of Bail in Canada</em>, <em>3ed</em>, Thomson Reuters 2017 (loose-leaf
    updated 2020, release 1), at pp. 8-25 to 8-30, the different orders subject to

    distinguish between arguments on a s. 680 review alleging errors in the bail proceedings,
    and arguments on the s. 680 review predicated on new evidence admitted on the
    review application. To the extent the s. 680 review alleges errors by the bail
    judge, the review is, in effect, an appeal of the bail judge’s order. In <em>R.
    v. Oland</em>, a case involving a s. 680 review of a bail pending appeal
    decision, Moldaver J., at para. 61, described the scope of the review in this
    way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, in my view, a panel reviewing a
    decision of a single judge under s. 680(1) should be guided by the following
    three principles. First, absent palpable and overriding error, the review panel
    must show deference to the judge’s findings of fact. Second, the review panel
    may intervene and substitute its decision for that of the judge where it is
    satisfied the judge erred in law or in principle and the error was material to
    the outcome. Third, in the absence of legal error, the review panel may
    intervene and substitute its decision for that of the judge where it concludes
    that the decision was clearly unwarranted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The review principles outlined in <em>Oland</em> mimic those applicable on conviction appeals. That approach provides for a
    review of an order for material error in law or principle and for palpable and
    overriding factual error. The review also contemplates an overriding review of
    the reasonableness of the decision rendered. <em>Oland</em> uses the phrase
    “clearly unwarranted”. I see no distinction between a reasonableness inquiry
    and a review to determine whether a decision was “clearly unwarranted”: see <em>R.
    v. K.M.</em>, 2017 ONCA 805 at para. 33.</span></p>

    from the present case in that <em>Oland</em> involved a review of an order in

    is premised on alleged errors by the bail judge, I see no principled reason for
    distinguishing, for the purposes of the scope of the review contemplated,
    between an order of a Superior Court judge under s. 522 and an order of a Court
    of Appeal judge under s. 679. There is nothing in the nature of the hearings contemplated
    by the two sections, the factors to be considered in making orders under the
    two provisions, or the relative expertise of the judges in bail matters, warranting
    different levels of scrutiny. </span></p>

    standard of review than the standard outlined in <em>Oland</em>. <em>St. Cloud</em> was not a s. 680 review. That case addressed the scope of the review
    contemplated under s. 520 or s. 521. Those sections apply to bail reviews by
    Superior Court judges of initial bail orders made by a justice.</span></p>

    errors in the bail hearing, there is no material difference between the
    standard described in <em>St. Cloud</em> and the standard set down in <em>Oland</em>.
    The court in <em>St. Cloud</em> said, at para. 121:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It will be appropriate to intervene if the
    justice has erred in law. It will also be appropriate for the reviewing judge
    to exercise this power if the impugned decision was clearly inappropriate, that
    is if the justice who rendered it gave excessive weight to one relevant factor
    or insufficient weight to another. The reviewing judge therefore does not have
    the power to interfere with the initial decision simply because he or she would
    have weighed the relevant factors differently.</span></p>

    Cloud</em> occurred in the context of a bail decision turning on the
    application of s. 515(10)(c), the public confidence criterion. That section
    requires a balancing of competing factors. <em>St. Cloud</em> envisions review
    of that balancing process for legal error, and for a “clearly inappropriate”
    weighing of the competing factors. If the reviewing court is satisfied the bail
    judge’s weighing of those factors was sufficiently skewed to produce a “clearly
    inappropriate” order, the court will intervene on the bail review. In my view, a
    finding a bail decision is “clearly inappropriate” amounts to a finding the
    bail decision is unreasonable. As I read <em>St. Cloud</em>, if the review
    under s. 520 or s. 521 rests on an alleged error at the initial bail hearing, <em>St.
    Cloud</em> contemplates review for legal error and unreasonableness.   </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>He claims he is no longer a risk to the public

    institutional adjustment escape risk and public safety concerns – the

    bail judge’s reasons. As I understand them, the bail judge made no finding with
    respect to Jaser’s present ideology. Instead, he concluded Jaser, who was a long-time
    fraudster with an established propensity to disobey court orders and a proven
    ability to manipulate others, including his family members, could not be relied
    on to comply with the terms of any release order, or submit to the supervision
    of his parents and brother. The bail judge determined the likelihood of Jaser’s
    reoffending in some way was enough to justify the finding Jaser had not met his
    onus on the secondary ground. The bail judge did not turn his mind to the
    nature of the potential reoffending beyond concluding it would reflect Jaser’s
    dishonesty and disregard for court orders. In short, the bail judge read the
    secondary ground as prohibiting release if there was a substantial likelihood
    Jaser would commit a criminal offence: <em>R. v. Jaser</em>, at para. 41.</span></p>

    above-quoted passage from <em>Morales</em> (see para.57). Not only must there
    be a substantial likelihood of committing an offence, that substantial
    likelihood must endanger the protection or safety of the public. It is one
    thing to conclude there is a significant risk Jaser would deceive his parents
    and breach curfew terms of a bail order, and a another to conclude Jaser, motivated
    by a terrorist-ideology, would seek out and participate in terrorist-related
    activity. The former may or may not compromise public safety. The latter
    clearly does.</span></p>

    would pose to the protection and safety of the public required an assessment of
    his present belief system. If, as of 2020, Jaser adhered to the terrorist worldview
    expressed in his 2012 conversations, or if there was a significant risk he held
    those beliefs, public safety concerns were clearly very real. The same
    conclusion would not follow if the bail judge was satisfied Jaser did not hold
    a terrorist ideology, but was a manipulative liar who could well breach the
    terms of his bail or become involved in the kind of fraudulent activity he had
    engaged in prior to his arrest. </span></p>

    the bail judge made that finding, his conclusion Jaser had not satisfied the
    onus on the secondary ground would have been justified. The problem is the bail
    judge left unanswered the crucial question in the assessment of the risk posed

    the bail judge, at para. 52, expressed “concerns” about the ability of Jaser’s

    bail judge did so primarily because of Jaser’s proclivity in the past to
    manipulate and deceive others, including his parents, for his own personal gain
    and advantage. This was the same consideration that led him to conclude there
    was a substantial likelihood Jaser would commit an offence if released.</span></p>

    the bail judge did not consider the extent to which his concerns could be
    mitigated by specific stringent bail terms allowing for significant ongoing
    police oversight of Jaser’s compliance with his bail terms. Nor did the bail
    judge consider whether Jaser’s parents’ susceptibility to his deceit and
    manipulation would continue in the very different circumstances presented in
    February 2020. Jaser faced serious allegations. His parents were very familiar
    with those allegations. They had to know Jaser, if released, would be under

    murder, he still “knew” his son “could not kill an insect on the ground” (para.
    48). I take the trial judge to be saying Mr. Jaser Sr.’s belief in his son’s

    surety.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> I see no connection between Mr. Jaser Sr.’s
    belief in his son’s innocence and his ability to properly fulfil his
    obligations as a surety. Many individuals, prepared to assume the significant obligations
    of a surety, do so because they firmly believe the accused person is innocent.
    Jaser is presumed innocent at this point.</span></p>

    perform his obligations as a surety. </span></p>

    (paras. 49-51). It is unclear to me what the bail judge means by this
    observation. Certainly, it cannot be assumed a newfound religious fervour
    signals a dissent into terrorism. There is no evidence Jaser manifested any
    terrorist beliefs to anyone in his family. With the benefit of hindsight, it
    may be Jaser’s interest in Islam in 2009-2010 was a twisted precursor to the
    development of a terrorist ideology. His parents cannot be faulted for missing
    that connection.</span></p>

    as a strong one. The Crown’s case came primarily out of Jaser’s own mouth.
    Jaser, through counsel, acknowledged he said what he is alleged to have said.
    Those words are powerful evidence of his enthusiastic support for mass murder
    in the name of religion. Taking those conversations at face value, Jaser was a
    committed terrorist, whose main concern was selecting the best plan to maximize
    the havoc and harm caused to Canadian society by his mass murders. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Jaser’s claim he only pretended to agree to defraud
    Tamer raises a valid defence. There are elements of the evidence capable of supporting
    Jaser’s position. Some of Jaser’s conversations with Tamer could reasonably be
    interpreted as a fraudsman making his pitch. Jaser’s decision to walk away from
    any discussions in late September, and the absence of any further connection
    with Esseghaier after late September, also lends some credence to Jaser’s
    defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, as Code J. cogently explained in his
    reasons for sentence, Jaser’s defence is inconsistent with a significant part of
    the evidence. Jaser’s many discussions with Esseghaier about plots to commit
    mass murder began well before Jaser knew of Tamer’s existence. Esseghaier had
    no money and hardly presented as a plausible fraud target: <em>R. v. Esseghaier</em>,
    2015 ONSC 5855 at paras. 28-36. In describing the case as a strong one, the
    bail judge joined company with the judge who heard the first bail application
    and the trial judge. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant also submits the bail judge
    wrongly treated Jaser’s convictions as proof of the strength of the Crown’s
    case. The verdicts have been set aside and are obviously not determinative of
    the weight of the Crown’s case. Nor, however, was the bail judge required to ignore
    those verdicts. The jury heard a great deal of evidence. Jaser was fully and
    vigorously defended. There is nothing in the ground of appeal on which the
    appeal was allowed that would justify ignoring the verdicts of the jury for the
    purposes of assessing the strength of the Crown’s case: <em>R. v. Esseghaier</em>,
    2019 ONCA 672 at para. 95. The bail judge was entitled to take the verdicts into
    account when assessing the apparent strength of the Crown’s case against Jaser. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also do not agree the jury’s failure to return
    a verdict against Jaser on count one reflects negatively on the strength of the
    fundamental allegation made by the Crown. The Crown alleged Jaser conspired to
    commit mass murder. The jury convicted him on count two, the count making that allegation
    in general terms. Unlike jury verdicts, findings of fact cannot be inferred
    from a jury’s failure to reach a verdict. Code J., in his reasons for sentence,
    offers a viable explanation for the jury’s conviction of Esseghaier on count
    one, and its failure to reach a verdict in respect to Jaser on that count. On
    his explanation, the failure to reach a verdict on count one does not suggest
    the jury gave any credence to Jaser’s “I was only pretending” defence. The
    verdict on count two is a flat out rejection of that defence: see <em>R. v.
    Esseghaier</em>, 2015 ONSC 5855 at para. 21.</span></p>

    cannot make an informed assessment about the admissibility of wiretaps that may
    be challenged on the retrial. The challenge was unsuccessfully advanced at the
    first trial: <em>R. v. Jaser</em>, 2014 ONSC 6052, although the applicant apparently
    has new arguments to make on the retrial. I proceed on the basis the evidence

    considering the potential length of the sentence Jaser might face if convicted.
    This consideration is made relevant to the tertiary ground by s.
    515(10)(c)(iv). The bail judge identified the controlling cases from this court:
    e.g. <em>R. v. Khalid</em>, 2010 ONCA 861 at para. 34; <em>R. v. Hersi</em>,
    2019 ONCA 94 at para. 54. Those cases hold convictions for terrorist activities
    aimed at the indiscriminate murder of innocent people will often warrant a life
    sentence, and failing a life sentence, sentences of 20 years or more. The bail

    convicted at the retrial on count one, count two, or both.</span></p>

    considering the tertiary ground: <em>R. v. St. Cloud</em>, at para. 69. In most
    cases, if all four factors clearly favour detention, bail will be refused on
    the tertiary ground, especially if the accused has the onus to show cause why
    he should be released: see <em>R. v. Jaser</em>, 2014 ONSC 1058 at para. 74; <em>R.

    factors in the tertiary ground assessment, the language of s. 515(10)(c) and <em>St.

    four enumerated factors, but all relevant circumstances: <em>R. v. St. Cloud</em>,
    at paras. 66-71. Those factors include the personal circumstances of the

    the presumption of innocence and the entitlement to reasonable bail: <em>R. v.

    the bail judge acknowledged the four factors enumerated in s. 515(10)(c) were
    not the only factors to be considered when engaging in the balancing required
    by the tertiary ground. The bail judge did not, however, make any  reference in
    his tertiary ground analysis to any other factors. He did not address the substantial
    body of evidence said to demonstrate that Jaser had become a very different
    person in the seven years since his arrest. Those changes reflected a prosocial
    attitude, a willingness to take responsibility for his own actions, and a
    determination to improve himself. Those changes, if real, were relevant to the
    balancing required under the tertiary ground.</span></p>

    continued to hold terrorist beliefs, and the genuineness of his apparent
    rehabilitation, are obviously closely related and turn largely on an assessment
    of the evidence relating to Jaser’s conduct while in custody for the last seven
    years. Without making any finding as to the genuineness of the apparent changes

    substantially reduced and correctional authorities have acted aggressively in
    instituting other measures known to provide some protection against the
    pandemic. To date, there has not been a single case of COVID-19 in the institution
    in which Jaser is being held. While we have all come to know how little we know

lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Jaser has never said under oath, or otherwise as far as I can tell,
    he does not presently hold any terrorist beliefs. Nor has he directly offered
    any explanation for the statements he made in the interceptions. I accept
    concerns about self-incrimination would limit what he could be expected to say,
    especially before his trial. However, given the defence Jaser advanced, I have difficulty
    understanding why, if Jaser does not hold terrorist beliefs, he has not repeatedly,
    expressly and loudly said so in these bail proceedings. Instead, Jaser says
    nothing about his beliefs, and certainly says nothing in a forum in which he
    could be cross-examined on his statements. I am left to discern his present
    beliefs by reference to his conduct in custody, while the very explicit
    language of his conversations in 2012 rings loud and clear.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Jaser has apparently never said anything to his religious
    counsellors about his attitudes with respect to terrorist activity. I
    understand that the practice of “confessions” is not part of the Muslim faith.
    Nonetheless it is strange the topic of whether Jaser holds terrorist beliefs
    has apparently never been raised by Jaser or the Imams in the course of their
    many discussions about religion and Jaser’s attitudes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Placed against Jaser’s words in 2012, and his silence on the topic
    since, is his conduct while in custody, especially after his sentencing in
    2015. That conduct has been largely positive throughout and has become more
    positive as time has gone on. Many sources, some independent of Jaser and
    experienced in dealing with persons in Jaser’s situation, are satisfied Jaser
    has gained real insight into his behavioural issues, developed a determination
    to improve himself and to become involved in prosocial activities. Much of
    Jaser’s conduct in the last five years is inconsistent with any adherence to a
    terrorist ideology.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I recognize Jaser’s history dictates caution in accepting the
    genuineness of Jaser’s apparent behavioural changes. His history as a liar and
    manipulator goes well beyond his arrest in 2013. The trial judge found Jaser
    lied to the psychologist retained by the defence for the purposes of sentencing
    in 2015. The federal correctional authorities in 2018 also described Jaser as a
    manipulator. If Jaser maintained a terrorist ideology, he would no doubt see
    the value of falsely presenting himself to the correctional authorities, his
    counsellors, and even his own family, as a changed person. Indeed, Jaser
    described this kind of manipulation in one of the intercepted communications.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>My doubts about the genuineness of Jaser’s purported rehabilitation and
    changed worldview do not, however, cause me to reject the evidence entirely and
    conclude Jaser has not changed. I do not discount his apparent rehabilitation
    as simply part of a long con game. Given the source of the reports, the time
    period covered by the reports, and their almost uniformly favourable
    description of Jaser, there is a real possibility Jaser has indeed changed and
    will, if released on bail, continue down that course and abide by his bail
    terms. Jaser’s apparent rehabilitation while in custody may well be real.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It may be suggested my inability to positively conclude Jaser does
    not harbour terrorist beliefs and is a changed person is enough to require his
    detention in light of the onus placed on Jaser by s. 515(6) to show cause why
    he should be released. Section 515 must be read as a whole. Section 515(6)
    requires Jaser to show cause why his detention is not necessary on any of the
    three grounds identified in s. 515(10). This inquiry requires a consideration
    of the alternatives to detention available on the evidence. Detention may be
    necessary if release without any significant terms is the only realistic alternative.
    Detention may not be necessary if concerns arising out of release can be
    adequately addressed by terms. Put differently, if I were able to positively
    conclude Jaser did not harbour terrorist beliefs and was rehabilitated, I would
    release him on minimal terms. Because I harbour concerns about his belief
    system and the genuineness of his rehabilitation, I must consider whether
    adequate terms can be imposed to render detention unnecessary.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The adequacy of any release plan depends, in part, on the availability
    of suitable sureties who are prepared, not only to supervise Jaser, but also to
    cooperate with the authorities in their attempts to monitor compliance with the
    bail order. The sureties are not, however, the only thing standing between
    compliance and non-compliance with a bail order. If the terms of the release
    give the police significant supervisory powers to be exercised at the
    discretion of the police, the court, in deciding whether terms adequately
    address bail-related concerns, is entitled to assume the police will diligently
    exercise supervisory powers given to them under the bail order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Based on my findings, Jaser poses a risk to public safety, and there
    is a genuine concern public confidence in the administration of justice would
    be undermined by his release. The question becomes – can release terms be
    fashioned which sufficiently address those risks so as to render the detention
    unnecessary? In answering that question, one must bear in mind Jaser is
    presumed innocent and Jaser will have spent over eight years in custody before
    his retrial is completed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I believe the appropriate terms can be fashioned. The terms must minimize
    Jaser’s movements outside of his mother’s home, limit his contacts with
    non-family members, and give the police the ability to oversee Jaser’s
    movements and monitor his compliance with the bail terms. On the terms I
    envision, Jaser’s liberty will be substantially circumscribed and the police
    will have broad authority to monitor and verify Jaser’s compliance with his
    bail terms on a daily, if not an hourly, basis.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Many of the terms I impose are contained in the draft order provided
    by counsel for the applicant after oral argument. While I propose a somewhat
    less strict house arrest provision, I propose other terms restricting Jaser’s
    movements and civil liberties going well beyond those suggested by counsel.
    Some of the terms I envision will also impose significant limits on the civil
    liberties of the sureties. It will, of course, be for them to decide whether
    they are content to accept those limits and act as sureties. The details of
    some of the terms I propose have not been discussed with counsel. Nor have
    counsel been offered the opportunity to address further terms in light of those
    I propose. A further hearing is necessary to permit counsel to make submissions
    concerning the workability, appropriateness, and sufficiency of the proposed
    terms. </span></p>

    adequate monitoring would require the sureties to consent to police activity limiting
    their own privacy rights. It will be for the sureties to decide if they are
