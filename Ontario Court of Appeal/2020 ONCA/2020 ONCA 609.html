    under the <em>Highway Traffic Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (the <em>HTA</em><i></i>)<i> </i>with speeding 80 km/h in a posted 60 km/h zone. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Summary Conviction Appeals</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeals were heard together by Misener J. of
    the Ontario Court of Justice (the Appeals Judge). On April 18, 2019, the
    Appeals Judge released reasons for judgment in which she dismissed the appeals
    (the Reasons Below). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeals Judge first addressed the question
    of what presumptive ceiling applied to Part I <em>POA</em><i> </i>proceedings.
    In this regard, she declined to follow <em>York (Regional Municipality) v. Tomovski</em><i>, </i>2017 ONCJ 785 (leave to appeal to Ont. C.A. refused, 2018 ONCA 57). In <em>Tomovski</em>,
    the court held that the 18-month presumptive ceiling set out in <em>R. v.
    Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, did not apply to proceedings under
    Part I of the <em>POA</em> and that a lower case specific presumptive ceiling
    ought to be imposed. In <em>Tomovski</em>, a ceiling of 14 months was set,
    above which delay was presumed to be unreasonable.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the Appeals Judges view, <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>clearly
    held that the ceiling for matters proceeding in provincial court is 18 months
    and Part I offences are proceedings in the provincial court (para. 15, Reasons
    Below). She gave compelling reasons for her view, including that differing
    presumptive ceilings would represent a return to the litigation-generating
    uncertainty of <em>Morin</em> (para. 21, Reasons Below). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeals Judge then dealt with whether the
    Appellants were entitled to a stay of proceedings despite the delay being less
    than the presumptive ceiling. The net delay for Mr. Graci was 12 months and 12
    days and the net delay for Mr. Nguyen was 13 months and 10 days. As the delays
    were less than the presumptive ceiling, the Appellants had the burden to
    establish that (1) they took steps to move their cases along and (2) their cases
    took markedly longer than they reasonably should have. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before the Appeals Judge, the Appellants argued
    that the justices of the peace held them to a standard of perfection, rather
    than of reasonableness, when considering whether they had taken meaningful efforts
    to move their cases along. The Appeals Judge disagreed, expressly accepting the
    findings of the justices of the peace that the Appellants had done nothing to
    secure earlier trial dates.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeals Judge also rejected the Appellants
    submission that, because proceedings for Part I offences are straightforward,
    anything in excess of 10-11 months from offence date to trial is markedly
    longer than is reasonable. The Appeals Judge acknowledged that Part I
    proceedings are simple and streamlined. However, she noted, the test for
    whether a case takes markedly longer than reasonable, as set out in <em>Jordan</em><i>, </i>directs the court to consider a variety of factors including case
    complexity, local considerations, and whether the Crown took reasonable steps
    to expedite the proceedings. Further, trial judges are directed to use their
    knowledge of their own jurisdictions local and systemic considerations and the
    length of time a similar case typically takes to reach trial in assessing the
    reasonableness of the time to trial in cases where the delay is below the
    ceiling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeals Judge observed that the justices of
    the peace who tried the Appellants cases regularly preside in the jurisdiction
    and were capable of quickly applying their extensive knowledge of local conditions
    and their experience with similar cases to assess the delays in the cases before
    them.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeals Judge then dealt with whether the
    Crown had taken reasonable steps to expedite the process. The Appellants
    submitted that it had not because it failed to offer earlier trial dates after
    being served with the s. 11(b) applications.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeals Judge disagreed. She saw no error on
    the part of the justices of the peace in concluding that the prosecutions had
    not taken markedly longer than usual. She observed that the Appellants had been
    provided with the earliest available trial dates after they filed their Notices
    of Intention to Appeal and that those dates were well below the presumptive
    ceiling. She stated that the filing of a s. 11(b) application did not trigger
    an obligation on the prosecution to obtain earlier dates and noted that the
    prosecution was ready to proceed on the first trial date, having provided the
    Appellants with timely disclosure. She concluded that the prosecution acted
    reasonably in expediting the matters.     </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the Appeals Judge dismissed the
    summary conviction appeals. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Issues</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellants raise the following issues:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>1.</span><span lang=EN-CA> Does the 18-month presumptive ceiling
    established in <em>Jordan</em> apply to proceedings under Part 1 of the <em>POA</em><i> </i>or should the ceiling be lower? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>2.</span><span lang=EN-CA> Are the Appellants entitled to stays
    despite the delays being below the presumptive ceiling? </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Issue #1:  18 months is the presumptive
    ceiling for Part I <i>POA </i>proceedings</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Parties
    Positions</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellants position on this issue can be
    summarized as follows. In setting the 18-month presumptive ceiling for criminal
    cases in provincial courts, <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>made no reference to if, or
    how, the presumptive ceiling would apply to <em>POA</em><i> </i>proceedings.
    They say that the 18-month presumptive ceiling established in <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>was premised on factors that do not  or minimally  apply to such proceedings.
    As the <em>POA</em> was meant to provide a speedy, streamlined procedure for
    regulatory offences, the Appellants contend that a lower presumptive ceiling
    for such matters is warranted. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that <em>R. v. K.J.M.</em><i>, </i>2019 SCC 55,<i> </i>a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada released
    after the appeals in this matter were decided, is a full answer to the
    Appellants contention. It says that <em>K.J.M.</em> makes it clear that the
    presumptive ceiling for all provincial court proceedings is 18 months.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I accept the Crowns submission on this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>K.J.M.</em>, the Supreme Court considered
    whether the presumptive ceilings in <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>apply to youth
    justice court proceedings. Justice Moldaver, writing for the majority,
    concluded that they did. While Moldaver J. acknowledged the many reasons why
    youth matters should proceed expeditiously, he found there was no need to
    introduce a lower presumptive ceiling for such matters. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At para. 65 of <em>K.J.M.</em><i>, </i>Moldaver
    J. states that <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>established uniform ceilings irrespective

    quickly become impracticable. Moreover, he concludes, setting different ceilings
    would be incompatible with the uniform-ceiling approach adopted in <em>Jordan</em><i> </i>and would undermine its objective of simplifying and streamlining the s.

    that the creation of a separate criminal justice system, which codifies the

    factum focuses almost exclusively on the first issue. Their arguments on this,
    the second issue, are cursory. They basically amount to a reiteration of the
    complaints that they advanced in the appeals court below, although the
    complaints are now levied against the decision of the Appeals Judge rather than
    those of the justices of the peace. </span></p>

    by holding them to a standard of perfection, rather than reasonableness, when
    considering their efforts to move their cases along. They repeat their
    complaint that the prosecution took no steps to mitigate the delay once served
    with notices of the s. 11(b) applications. And, the Appellants submit, it
    should not have taken more than 11-12 months from the offence dates to bring
    the Appellants to trial.</span></p>

    of the justices of the peace on the issues of whether the Appellants took
    meaningful steps to move their cases along and whether their cases took
    markedly longer than they reasonably should have. In her reasons, the Appeals
    Judge thoroughly addresses the Appellants complaints relating to those
    determinations. I agree with her determinations and with the reasons that she
    gave for them.</span></p>

    that the Appellants had failed to take reasonable steps to move their cases
    along or that their cases had not taken markedly longer than they reasonably should
