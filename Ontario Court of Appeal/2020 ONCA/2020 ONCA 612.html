    1628 (“Condo 1628”) moves to quash an appeal brought by Toronto Standard
    Condominium Corporation No. 1636 (“Condo 1636”), Soho Grand Condominiums Inc.
    (“Soho”), and Soinco Ltd. (“Soinco”) from the order of the motion judge refusing
    to stay a court proceeding in favour of arbitration. Condo 1628 claims this court
    lacks jurisdiction because the appeal is barred by s. 7(6) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act, 1991</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, S.O. 1991, c. 17

    7(5), s. 7(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>provides that if a party to an arbitration agreement commences a court
    proceeding about a matter they agreed would be submitted to arbitration, the
    court shall, on the motion of another party to the arbitration agreement, stay
    the court proceeding. Under s. 7(5), when arbitrable and non-arbitrable matters
    are combined in a single court proceeding, if certain conditions are met, the court
    may stay the proceeding with respect to the matters dealt with in the
    arbitration agreement and allow it to continue with respect to the other
    matters. Section 7(6) decrees: “There is no appeal from the court’s decision.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> (2000), 137 O.A.C. 79 (C.A.), held that if a motion judge decides that
    an arbitration agreement does not apply to the dispute before the court, then the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> also does
    not apply, including the bar on appeals in s. 7(6). </span><em><span

    seven unanimous decisions, including by two five-judge panels, and adopted as persuasive

lang=EN-CA>TELUS Communications Inc. v. Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    2019 SCC 19, [2019] 2 S.C.R. 144. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, Moldaver J. for the majority held that s. 7(5) “does not grant the
    court discretion to refuse to stay claims that are dealt with in an arbitration
    agreement”: at para. 8. He ruled that s. 7(5) “does not … permit the court to
    ignore a valid and binding arbitration agreement”: at para. 103. </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> overturned this court’s
    contrary interpretation of s. 7(5) in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Griffin v.

    leave to appeal refused, [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 75, which had construed s. 7(5) as
    granting a motion judge discretion to refuse to stay claims dealt with in an arbitration
    agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I elaborate below, although </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> overturned </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Griffin</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> on the interpretation of s.
    7(5), it did not disturb the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases on the interpretation of s. 7(6). In my view, the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases was correctly
    decided.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I also conclude that s. 7(6) does not bar an appeal
    from the motion judge’s order in this case. The motion judge found that the
    proceeding before the court combines matters that are dealt with in the
    arbitration agreement with other matters that are not dealt with in the
    arbitration agreement. Because the motion judge did not have the benefit of </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> at the time of his decision, he
    applied this court’s decision in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Griffin</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, refused to stay any part of the proceeding under s. 7(5), and
    allowed the entire proceeding to continue before the court. But as </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> later confirmed, s. 7(5) does
    not grant the court discretion to refuse to stay claims that are dealt with in
    an arbitration agreement, and does not permit a court to ignore a valid and
    binding arbitration agreement. Because the motion judge granted relief that was
    unavailable under s. 7(5) or elsewhere in s. 7, he did not make a decision under
    s. 7, so an appeal is not barred by s. 7(6). And because this was a final order
    — terminating potential proceedings before the arbitrator and overriding a
    substantive contractual right to arbitrate — an appeal lies to this court under
    s.&nbsp;6(1)(b) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Courts of Justice Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore dismiss the motion to quash
    the appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> to the mandatory stay under s. 7(1) apply: at paras. 67, 69-70. But

    brought against a cellphone company on behalf of a class of customers consisting

    overturned this court’s decision in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span

    should abide by their agreement, a policy that is tied to two principles. The
    first is “party autonomy” — “the principle that parties should generally be
    allowed to craft their own dispute resolution mechanism through consensual
    agreement”: at para. 52 (citations omitted). The second is “the principle of
    limited court intervention in arbitration matters”: at para. 55.</span></p>

    agreement should abide by their agreement <span class=Underline>goes hand in
    hand</span> with the principle of limited court intervention in arbitration
    matters”: at para. 55 (emphasis added). The principle of limited court
    intervention in arbitration matters fosters party autonomy and respects the
    parties’ choice of arbitration as their dispute resolution mechanism. As
    Moldaver J. explained, the “hands off” approach to matters governed by the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> is “in keeping with the
    modern approach that sees arbitration as an autonomous, self-contained, self&#8209;sufficient

    that “[a]s far as possible, multiplicity of legal proceedings shall be
    avoided”, does not provide a basis to override s. 7(5). He noted that the
    stipulation in s. 138 that the court “shall” avoid a multiplicity of
    proceedings is tempered by language that the court must do so only “as far as
    possible”. He observed that s. 7(5) “expressly contemplates bifurcation of
    proceedings”, with a potentially concurrent arbitration and court adjudication,
    and therefore the court must give effect to the will of the legislature in s.
    7(5): at para. 90.</span></p>

    non-arbitrable matters are combined in a single court proceeding and it is
    reasonable to separate these matters, s. 7(5) gives the motion judge discretion
    to allow the court proceeding to continue in respect of the matters not dealt
    with in the arbitration agreement, provided that the judge stays the court
    proceeding in respect of the matters dealt with in the arbitration agreement. But
    under s. 7(5) the motion judge cannot refuse to stay the court proceeding in
    respect of the matters dealt with in the arbitration agreement: at paras.
    101-102. Section 7(5) “does not … permit the court to ignore a valid and
    binding arbitration agreement”: at para. 103.</span></p>

    class proceeding and refer the dispute to arbitration because he held that the
    arbitration clause did not apply retroactively to the training period. On a
    motion to quash the appeal, Finlayson J.A. for the court held, at para. 10, that

    not applicable: see <em>Deluce Holdings Inc. v. Air Canada</em> (1992), 12 O.R.

    that, unless an appeal lies to the Divisional Court, an appeal lies to the

    He ruled that the dismissal of the stay motion was a final order as to the

lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This review of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases shows that courts have tackled the question of when
    s. 7(6) bars an appeal through several related inquiries. Courts have held that
    s. 7(6) does not bar an appeal when: (i) there is no arbitration agreement or
    no applicable arbitration agreement; (ii) the dispute lies beyond the scope of s.
    7; (iii) the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> does not apply; and (iv) the motion judge did not make a decision under
    s. 7. Each of these inquiries is directed at the same question — the question raised
    by s. 7(6) — whether the motion judge made a decision under s. 7 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. If the answer is
    “yes”, s. 7(6) bars an appeal. If the answer is “no”, s. 7(6) does not bar an
    appeal.</span></p>

    consider the three questions arising on this motion: (1) Did </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> overrule the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases? (2) Should the </span><em><span

    Does s.&nbsp;7(6) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> bar this appeal?</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although Condo 1628 relies on </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, it does not claim that </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> overruled the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases on the
    interpretation of s. 7(6). Its factum accepts that “</span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> expressly avoids ruling on s.
    7(6)”, and states that Moldaver J. “declines to make a final ruling on [s.
    7(6)] for a variety of reasons”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with Condo 1628’s interpretation of </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> on this point.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moldaver J. referred to s. 7(6) in two
    paragraphs of his reasons. The first time was at the end of the discussion of
    the “Section 7 Framework”, at para. 91:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>(iv)     Section 7(6) – Bar on Appeals</span></u></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[91]    Finally, s. 7(6) provides simply that
    “[t]here is no appeal from the court’s decision”. Given the absence of any
    qualifying language, s. 7(6) must be taken as referring to a “decision” made
    under any subsection <span style='color:black'>contained </span>in s. 7. This
    would include, for example, a decision to stay the proceeding under s. 7(1), a
    decision to refuse a stay under s. 7(2), or a decision to order a partial stay
    under s. 7(5).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This paragraph was not part of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>ratio decidendi</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:
normal'> of the majority decision, </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>because this
    was not the legal point actually decided. The point actually decided was that
    the lower courts had erred in law “by interpreting s. 7(5) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> incorrectly and
    refusing to order a stay that, under s. 7(1), was mandatory … [Section] 7(5)
    does not … permit the court to ignore a valid and binding arbitration
    agreement”: at para. 103.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Still, para. 91 of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> forms part of the majority’s discussion of the s. 7 framework and should
    be viewed as </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>obiter dicta</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> intended to provide guidance, while mindful that not every phrase
    in a judgment of the Supreme Court should be treated as if enacted in a
    statute: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Henry</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    2005 SCC 76, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 57. I take Moldaver J.’s central
    point to be that the “decision” referred to in s. 7(6) is a decision “made
    under any subsection contained in s. 7” — an observation consistent with, and
    reflected in, the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second time Moldaver J. referred to s. 7(6) in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> was just
    before the conclusion of his reasons, at para. 104:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><u><span lang=EN-CA>4. Section 7(6) – Bar on Appeals</span></u></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[104]  Finally, I note that the court below
    did not address the potential application of s. 7(6) of the <em>Arbitration Act</em>,
    and the matter was discussed only briefly during oral argument before this
    Court. <span style='color:black'>Neither of the parties </span>has suggested
    that the s. 7(6) bar applies. <span style='color:black'>In the absence of </span>full

    conclude that </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> did not overrule the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span

  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Condo 1628’s submission</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Condo 1628 submits that this court should
    overrule the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases. Its submission rests on three propositions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, Condo 1628 asserts that the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases is not in
    accordance with the modern approach to statutory interpretation. Condo 1628’s
    factum contends that there are only two possible interpretations of s. 7(6):
    “either s. 7(6) bars all appeals under s. 7”, which it calls “the comprehensive
    interpretation”; or “s. 7(6) only bars appeals where a stay has been granted”,
    which it calls “the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>status quo</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> interpretation”, and which it says is reflected in the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases. Condo 1628 claims that
    this court should prefer the comprehensive interpretation over the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>status quo</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> interpretation “[a]s most
    consistent with the purpose and spirit of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration
    Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, including the ‘hands off’ approach of limited
    judicial intervention that </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> affirms”, and because “the comprehensive interpretation better
    reflects the modern approach to statutory interpretation”. Condo 1628 submits that
    s. 7 must be read as “a one-time opportunity for a party to an arbitration
    agreement to challenge a proceeding in the courts. Once that opportunity is
    exhausted, there is no further recourse. </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>There is
    no appeal</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>” (emphasis in original).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Condo 1628 asserts that s. 7(6)
    precludes any appeal “from a motion <span class=Underline>brought</span> under
    s. 7, including this appeal” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, Condo 1628 asserts that the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases is wrongly decided
    because it reads words into s. 7(6) by allowing an appeal to this court if the
    motion judge refused to stay the court proceeding. Condo 1628’s factum contends
    that the reasoning of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases is “[i]mpeccably logical, but this is not what s. 7
    says”:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>S. 7(6) does not distinguish between results.
    Whether a stay is granted or denied, the decision is still one under s. 7. It
    is the <em>Court’s decision</em>. S. 7(6) bars appeals from the “court’s
    decision”. Had the Legislature intended to bar appeals from stays but allow
    appeals from refusals it could have said so. It chose not to.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The <em>status quo</em> interpretation
    inferentially adds a term to s. 7: if the motions Court refuses the stay, then
    it is not a “court’s decision” under s. 7(6). This added term is unexpressed in
    s. 7. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addressing Condo 1628’s submission, I
    acknowledge that the proper interpretation of s. 7(6) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> is not straightforward.
    The appellate jurisprudence in four provinces interpreting the eight words in
    s. 7(6) confirms this; see also </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Hnatiuk</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 27 (interpretation of s. 7(6) “not so straightforward”
    despite “first blush” reading of the provision); </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Opron
    Maritimes</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at para. 39.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I will explain, however, ultimately I do not
    accept Condo 1628’s interpretation of s. 7(6) or the three propositions on
    which it is based. In my view, the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases was correctly decided.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Condo 1628’s first proposition is that the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases does not reflect
    the modern approach to statutory interpretation. It says that the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases fails to read the
    words of s. 7(6) in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration
    Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, the object of that Act, and the intention of
    the Ontario legislature.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree with this submission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I start with the text of s. 7(6). Section 7(6)
    states: “There is no appeal from the court’s decision”. This raises the question:
    what “decision” is referred to?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This question was answered by Moldaver J. in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at para. 91: “[g]iven the
    absence of any qualifying language, s. 7(6) must be taken as referring to a ‘decision’
    made under any subsection </span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>contained </span><span lang=EN-CA>in s. 7”. Moldaver J. gave as examples of “decisions”
    made under s. 7 “a decision to stay the proceeding under s. 7(1), a decision to
    refuse a stay under s. 7(2), or a decision to order a partial stay under s.
    7(5)”: at para. 91.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Interpreting s. 7(6) as barring an appeal when
    the court </span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>makes a “decision” </span><span
lang=EN-CA>under any other subsection of s. 7 reads s. 7(6) in context, which
    includes the rest of s. 7. By contrast, Condo 1628’s interpretation reads s.
    7(6) as essentially a standalone provision, in isolation from the rest of s. 7,
    as barring an appeal whenever a motion is brought under s. 7 — this is Condo
    1628’s second proposition, which I address below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Supreme Court’s recent decision in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Uber Technologies Inc. v. Heller</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2020 SCC
    16, adds further weight to the view that s. 7(6) bars an appeal only from a
    “decision” made under s. 7 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. A majority of the Court held that an arbitration agreement in a
    standard form contact between Uber and its drivers was unenforceable. One issue
    before all three levels of court was which arbitration statute applied to the
    dispute — the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, which contains an appeal bar in s. 7(6), or the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>International Commercial Arbitration Act, 2017</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, S.O. 2017, c. 2, Sched. 5 (“</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>ICAA</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>”), which contains no counterpart to s. 7(6). Uber brought a motion under
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>ICAA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> to stay the proposed
    class proceeding in favour of arbitration. The motion judge agreed that the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>ICAA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> applied and stayed the proceeding: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Heller v. Uber Technologies Inc.</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, 2018 ONSC 718, 421 D.L.R. (4th) 343, at paras. 34, 50, 80. On
    appeal, this court had “serious reservations” about this conclusion, but stated
    that nothing turned on it and allowed the appeal because the court held that the
    arbitration agreement was unenforceable: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Heller v.
    Uber Technologies Inc.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2019 ONCA 1, 145 O.R. (3d)
    81, at paras. 16, 21, and 74. On further appeal to the Supreme Court, Abella
    and Rowe JJ. for the majority dismissed the appeal. They held that the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> rather than the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>ICAA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> applied, but in a footnote remarked
    that had the motion judge issued a stay of the court proceeding under the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> — the properly
    applicable statute — no appeal to the Court of Appeal would have been available
    because of s. 7(6). Abella and Rowe JJ. stated, at para. 19, footnote 5:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We note in passing that <span

    been permissible [citations omitted]. <span style='color:black'>In this case, </span>because

lang=EN-CA> line of cases — s. 7(6) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration
    Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> bars an appeal only when the motion judge made
    a “decision” under s. 7.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This interpretation also respects the two principles
    animating the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act — </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>party autonomy and limited court intervention in arbitration
    matters. When, for example, a motion judge finds that an arbitration agreement and
    thus the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> do not apply, neither principle is undercut. But if on appeal this
    court concludes that the arbitration agreement and thus the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> do apply and that the
    dispute should be referred to arbitration, this court’s decision promotes party
    autonomy by holding the parties to their agreement to arbitrate. It also
    promotes limited court intervention in arbitration matters, because the court intervenes
    only to ensure that the dispute is arbitrated as agreed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, Condo 1628’s interpretation undercuts
    party autonomy by precluding an appeal even when a motion judge erroneously
    fails to give effect to an arbitration agreement. Further, although Condo 1628
    extols its approach as respecting the principle of limited court intervention, its
    approach misunderstands that principle by detaching it from the principle of
    party autonomy. The principle of limited court intervention is a principle of limited
    court intervention <span class=Underline>in the arbitration process</span>. Improperly
    ending an arbitration before it has begun does nothing to promote that principle
    and instead flouts the principle of party autonomy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore reject Condo 1628’s first
    proposition, that the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases strays from the modern approach to statutory
    interpretation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would also reject Condo 1628’s second
    proposition, that s. 7(6) bars an appeal from any motion <span class=Underline>brought</span> under s. 7. Section 7(6) refers to a “decision”, not to “a motion brought”,
    under s. 7. To state the obvious, a motion may be brought on one statutory basis,
    but the court’s decision may be made on a different basis. Citing s. 7 in a
    notice of motion does not bar an appeal to this court. What matters is the
    statutory basis of the motion judge’s “decision” — whether the court’s decision
    was <span class=Underline>made</span> under s. 7.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Condo 1628 further argues that not only was the
    motion before the motion judge here “brought” under s. 7, because s. 7 was the
    “stated source” for the motion, but s. 7 was also the basis of the motion
    judge’s decision, because that provision was “integral” to his reasons. This
    argument does not depend on establishing that the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases was wrongly decided; it asserts that even under the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases, s. 7(6) bars an
    appeal. I will address this argument below when I apply the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> line of cases to this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, I would reject the third proposition
    advanced by Condo 1628, that the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases reads words into s. 7(6) by permitting appeals to
    this court when the motion judge refuses to stay the court proceeding.
    According to Condo 1628, the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases creates an asymmetric rule: appeals are barred if the
    motion judge stays a court proceeding under s. 7 (which Condo 1628 accepts is correct),
    but appeals are not barred if the motion judge refuses to stay a court
    proceeding under s. 7 (which Condo 1628 claims is wrong).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, Condo 1628’s submission does not
    accurately describe the caselaw interpreting s. 7(6). The caselaw recognizes that
    there can be no appeal from a motion judge’s decision either to grant or refuse
    a stay if the decision is made under s. 7. For example, in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Brown</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, Charron J.A. summarized the
    appeal bar in s. 7(6) as applying “to any decision by the motions court under
    s. 7 to grant</span><em><span lang=EN-CA> </span></em><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-CA>or refuse a stay</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> of ‘</span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>a proceeding in respect of a matter to be submitted to arbitration
    under the agreement</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>’ within the meaning of s. 7(1)”:
    at para. 8 (italics in original, underlining added). Charron J.A.’s statement tracks
    the example Moldaver J. gave in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, that s. 7(6) bars an appeal from “a decision <span
class=Underline>to refuse a stay</span> under s.&nbsp;7(2)”: at para. 91
    (emphasis added). See also </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Opron Maritimes</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 32: “if a motion judge concludes that at least one of the
    criteria in s. 7(2) is met, and, as a result, </span><em><u><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'>refuses to stay</span></u></em><span lang=EN-CA> the
    proceeding, there can be no appeal from that decision” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, the caselaw interpreting s. 7(6) does not
    create an asymmetric rule. Section 7(6) bars an appeal from a motion judge’s
    decision made under s. 7, whether that decision grants or refuses a stay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would therefore reject each of the three
    propositions Condo 1628 advances to overturn the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases. In my view, the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Huras</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> line of cases was correctly decided.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Issue #3: Does s. 7(6) of the <em>Arbitration
    Act</em> Bar This Appeal?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The final issue is whether s. 7(6) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> bars this appeal. If the
    motion judge made a decision under s. 7, then s. 7(6) bars an appeal; but if
    the motion judge did not make a decision under s. 7 and his decision involved a
    final order, an appeal lies to this court under s. 6(1)(b) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Courts of Justice Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As already noted, Condo 1628 asserts that the

    the motion before him and was “integral” to his reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although there is force to Condo 1628’s argument
    that s. 7 was integral to the motion judge’s reasons, I have concluded that the
    motion judge did not make a “decision” under s. 7 of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:
normal'>, and thus s. 7(6) does not bar this appeal</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>. I reach this conclusion for three reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, the motion judge did not make a decision under s. 7(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'>. He</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> did not stay the
    court proceeding, in whole or in part.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Second, the motion judge did not make a decision under s. 7(2) of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>.
    He held that none of the exceptions under s. 7(2) applies: at para. 67. This
    ruling is not challenged.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Third, the motion judge did not make a decision under s. 7(5) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. That
    provision provides no statutory authority to refuse to grant a stay of the
    arbitrable claims. Such a disposition is unavailable under s. 7.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The motion judge, however, refused to grant a stay of any part of the
    court proceeding. He applied this court’s decision in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Griffin</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> and concluded that he had
    statutory authority to override the parties’ arbitration agreement and to
    permit the entire action — including the arbitrable claims — to proceed in court:
    at paras. 72&#8209;76. But the Supreme Court in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> held that s. 7(5) provides no such authority. Such a disposition is
    unavailable under s. 7. Under s. 7(5), the motion judge could </span><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>order only a partial stay of the court
    proceeding </span><span lang=EN-CA>— to allow the matters not dealt with in the
    arbitration agreement to proceed in court. Had he ordered a partial stay under
    s. 7(5), s. 7(6) would have barred an appeal from that decision. But he had no
    authority to order that “the entire matter should proceed in the form of the
    application before this court”: at para. 76. This was not a disposition available
    to him under s. 7(5).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is not enough, in my view, for a motion judge </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>to intend or purport to make</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> a decision under s. 7(5) to trigger the appeal bar in s. 7(6). Rather,
    s. 7(6) is triggered only where s. 7(5) provides </span><em><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-style:normal'>statutory authority</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> for
    the court’s decision, that is, where the potential disposition is permitted
    under s. 7(5). If s. 7(5) cannot sustain a motion judge’s decision to override
    an arbitration agreement, then that decision cannot be made under s. 7(5). Otherwise,
    even after the Supreme Court’s decision in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, s. 7(6) would bar an appeal to this court if a motion judge continues
    to apply </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Griffin</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> in
    error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I recognize that the motion judge did not have the benefit of </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> when he made his decision</span><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>. </span><span lang=EN-CA>At the time, this court’s
    interpretation of s. 7(5) in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Griffin</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> would have afforded him a discretion to override the arbitration
    agreement and allow the entire court proceeding to continue before the court. But
    the Supreme Court in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> corrected this court’s earlier error of interpretation and explained
    what s. 7(5) always meant, from the day of its enactment. The Court did not
    change what s. 7(5) meant or alter its meaning with prospective effect only. Section
    7(5) </span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>never</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> provided statutory authority for the motion judge to override the
    parties’ arbitration agreement. Such a disposition has never been available under
    s. 7(5). The motion judge’s decision was thus not made — because it could not be
    made — under s. 7(5).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I find support for this conclusion on the legal effect of the
    Supreme Court in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Wellman</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> overturning this court’s erroneous interpretation of s. 7(5) in Lord
    Nicholls’ speech in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>National Westminster Bank plc
    v. Spectrum Plus Limited</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, [2005] UKHL 41, [2005] 2
    A.C. 680. Lord Nicholls eloquently described how, generally, a court correcting
    an erroneous judicial interpretation of legislation does not change the law or
    overrule a previous decision with prospective effect only. Instead, the court gives
    effect to the legislature’s intention from the date of the enactment of the
    legislation. As Lord Nicholls explained, at para. 38:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he interpretation the court gives an Act of
    Parliament is the meaning which, in legal concept, the statute has borne from
    the very day it went onto the statute book. So, it is said, when your
    Lordships’ House rules that a previous decision <span style='color:black'>on
    the interpretation of </span>a statutory provision was wrong, <span
style='color:black'>there is no question of the House changing the </span>law.
    The House is doing no more than correct an error of interpretation. Thus, there
    should be no question of the House overruling the previous decision with
    prospective effect only. <span style='color:black'>If the House were to take </span>that
    course it would be sanctioning the continuing misapplication of the statute so
    far as existing transactions or past events are concerned. The House, it is
    said, has no power to do this. Statutes express the intention of Parliament.
    The courts must give effect to that intention from the date the legislation
    came into force. The House, acting in its judicial capacity, must give effect
    to the statute and it must do so <span style='color:black'>in accordance with </span>what
    it considers is the proper interpretation of the statute.</span></p>

    the arbitration agreement. Such a disposition is unavailable and has always
    been unavailable under s. 7(5). The motion judge’s decision was therefore not
    made under s. 7 of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Arbitration Act</span></em><span

    — terminating any possible proceedings before the arbitrator and countermanding
    a substantive contractual right to arbitrate — an appeal from that order lies
