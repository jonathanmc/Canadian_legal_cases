    22, 2019.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=MsoHeader align=center style='text-align:center'>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2001, Mr. Groves was found not criminally responsible on account of a
    mental disorder (“NCRMD”) in relation to charges of sexual assault, sexual
    touching, and failure to comply with a probation order. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offences relate to Mr. Groves’ conduct towards a five-year-old girl
    who lived next door. Mr. Groves, who was 26 at the time, became acquainted with
    her family and routinely babysat this child. On a number of occasions, he
    touched her vagina over her clothing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groves has a youth criminal record for sexual offences against
    children. When Mr. Groves was 15, he worked at a restaurant, where he confined
    a six-year old boy in a washroom stall. He told this boy he was a doctor and
    needed to examine him. He attempted to insert a pen into the boy’s rectum. On a
    separate occasion, Mr. Groves confined a five-year-old boy in a washroom stall
    at the same restaurant. When he was 17, Mr. Groves exposed himself to two
    children (ages 4 and 5) and made one of them touch his penis. When he was 23,
    he sexually assaulted the 2 ½-year-old son of his common law partner. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groves’ current diagnoses are: pedohebephilia, personality disorder NOS
    (with features of antisocial and narcissistic personality disorder), and mild
    intellectual disability.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groves has been subject to a detention order since 2001, when he was
    found NCRMD. Since then, he has been detained at multiple secure forensic units
    under 24-hour supervision, with no indirectly supervised access to the
    community. Since 2009, his disposition has permitted Mr. Groves to live in the
    community in 24-hour supervised accommodation approved by the person in charge.
    Since May 2012, he has been living in a house supervised by VITA Community
    Living Services, an organization, which among other things, assists people living
    with mental challenges. He has been accepted for and is awaiting transfer to
    another VITA home in Schomberg, Ontario. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At his most recent hearing before the Ontario Review Board (“the Board”),
    Mr. Groves did not dispute his detention. However, he sought two exceptions to
    his detention order: (a) that he have indirectly supervised passes into the
    community through the “Community Trust Program” available through VITA; or (b)
    in the event that the Board did not accede to his first request, that he be
    permitted to be indirectly supervised for the specific purpose of taking his G2
    driver’s licence road test. Despite the opposition of the Hospital and the
    Attorney General, the Board granted Mr. Groves’ request for indirect
    supervision for the purpose of taking his driving test. The Board did not grant
    his broader request to have indirectly supervised passes into the community for
    participation in the Community Trust Program.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Groves advances three grounds of appeal.  First, he submits that the
    Board misapprehended his position by failing to consider both of his requests,
    noted in para. 6 above. Second, he contends that the Board’s reasons for
    denying his request for indirectly supervised passes are insufficient. And
    third, Mr. Groves asks us to find that the Board’s disposition was unreasonable
    and not supported by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are unable to give effect to these submissions.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Analysis</h1>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board Did Not Misapprehend Mr. Groves’ Request</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the Board did not misapprehend the dual nature of Mr.
    Groves’ position. A review of the transcript of the proceedings demonstrates
    that the issue was presented by counsel and discussed with Board members at the
    hearing. Moreover, Mr. Groves’ broader request was a significant focus of the
    testimony of his psychiatrist, Dr. Meng. The Board reviewed and accepted her
    testimony in their reasons for disposition.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    acknowledge that there is language in the Board’s reasons that, when considered
    in isolation, suggest that it failed to consider the request for indirectly
    supervised access to the community. For example, in framing the issues before
    it, the Board said the following, at para. 6: </p>
  <p class=CQuote>Counsel for Mr. Groves indicated she was not conceding the
    issue of significant threat, but was not disputing the continuation of the
    Disposition, <u>save for a request that a term be added to provide him with
    indirectly supervised privileges to attend at the MTO to apply for his G2
    driver’s licence.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>This passage makes no reference to Mr. Groves’ broader
    request for indirectly supervised passes for the purpose of participating in
    the Community Trust Program.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    when read as a whole, it is evident from the Board’s reasons that it considered
    both aspects of Mr. Groves’ position. As the Board said, at para. 16:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>With respect to the request for indirectly supervised passes</u>,
    Dr. Meng said the VITA program staff did not approve indirectly supervised
    passes and stated that it was a critical part of Mr. Groves’ management plan
    that he have continuous supervision while in the community to prevent any
    reoffending….<u>With respect to  the request for indirectly supervised
    privileges to attend at the MTO for a driving test, Dr. Meng expressed concern
    about this request in that it potentially could expose Mr. Groves to children in
    the course of the testing.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board returned to the issue of the driving test, at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><u>With respect to the driving test</u>, Dr. Meng acknowledged
    it appeared to be important to Mr. Groves that he be able to take the test and
    achieve success in this regard. She emphasized that it was important Mr. Groves
    have supervision and support of the VITA staff during this process. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    paragraphs demonstrate that the Board understood the distinction between Mr.
    Groves’ two requests. Therefore, when the reasons are viewed holistically, it
    cannot be said that the Board misapprehended the nature of Mr. Groves’ position. 
    We would dismiss this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h2>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s Reasons Are Sufficient</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    terms of the sufficiency of reasons, Mr. Groves submits that, although the
    Board referred to the evidence bearing on the appropriateness of indirectly
    supervised passes, it made no clear finding on this issue. After reviewing the
    evidence, the Board reached the following conclusion, at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Having heard and considered all the evidence and submissions from
    the parties, the Board found Mr. Groves continues to represent a significant
    threat to the safety of the public. We made this finding on the basis of the
    evidence of Dr. Meng and the Hospital Report. It is clear from all the evidence
    that Mr. Groves continues to require intense and ongoing supervision and
    structure which is currently provided to him at the VITA residence in King. It
    is noteworthy that his care is being transitioned to a new residence, which in
    the opinion of his caregivers and Dr. Meng, will give rise to new challenges
    with respect to managing the significant risk he poses to the public,
    especially children. Mr. Groves has a long history of predatory and very
    concerning sexually-inappropriate behaviour and requires the structure and
    support he is currently receiving and will receive in the new residence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    its face, this passage seems to conflate the question of significant threat in
    s. 672.4201 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 with the
    appropriateness of the privileges that Mr. Groves sought. Although the two
    issues are related, they are not the same thing. It would have been preferable for
    the Board to address them separately. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in this case, the reason why Mr. Groves continues to present a significant
    threat also justifies the rejection of his request for broader indirectly
    supervised privileges. In particular, the Board concluded based on “all the
    evidence” that Mr. Groves requires “intense and ongoing supervision”,
    especially in a time of heightened risk due to his transition to a new
    residence. This finding belies his request to participate in community
    programming under less supervision than he is accustomed to. Rather, the
    Board’s reasons suggest that this is a time where he may need <em>more</em> supervision, not less.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Groves further submits that the Board failed to address the true nature of his
    request for indirectly supervised privileges. He was not seeking wide-ranging
    privileges that would allow him liberal access to the community; instead, he
    requested modest, incremental privileges that allowed him a measure of freedom
    that is consistent with the need to restrict his access to children. This theme
    was pursued in the cross-examination of Dr. Meng, who agreed that it is not a
    “one size fits all ladder of privileges” and that “a flexible and
    individualized plan” may be “geared to each person’s circumstances.” Nevertheless,
    Dr. Meng maintained her opinion that the proposed plan was not appropriate at
    this time.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board accepted Dr. Meng’s assessment of the suitability of what was being
    proposed. Again, it would have been preferable for the Board to address the
    nuances of Mr. Groves’ proposal in greater detail. Nonetheless, overall, the
    reasons are sufficient to inform Mr. Groves why he was unsuccessful; they also
    enable this court to understand why the Board decided the case as it did. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We
    are advised that Mr. Groves’ next hearing before the Board is scheduled for
    October 28, 2020. Should this issue arise again, it would be helpful if the
    Board confronted this aspect of the evidence more directly. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board’s Disposition Was Reasonable</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    we cannot say that the disposition crafted by the Board was unreasonable. The
    Hospital Report and the evidence of Dr. Meng – both of which the Board
    expressly adopted – amply supported the Board’s disposition. The evidence demonstrated
    that, without direct supervision, Mr. Groves is at high risk to re-offend
    against children. As stated in the Hospital Report:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>Mr. Groves has indicated an interest in participating in the
    “Community Trust Program” at VITA, which entails that an individual be given
    increased freedom under indirect supervision in the community. <u>In the
    opinion of the treatment team, Mr. Groves’ risk is not compatible with indirect
    community privileges at this time. This is necessitated by his long-standing
    paraphilic urges combined with his externalization of responsibility for his
    behaviour and the need for constant supervision as part of his risk management
    plan.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Meng reaffirmed this view at the hearing. She also testified that VITA staff did
    not support Mr. Groves’ participation in the Community Trust Program, and there
    was no indication that this position would change in the following year. It was
    common ground at the hearing of the appeal that the Board could not compel VITA
    to accept Mr. Groves into this program. Consequently, the program that Mr.
    Groves sought to participate in was not available to him at the time. The Board
    was aware of this important circumstance. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the evidence before the Board, the disposition was reasonable. We would
    dismiss this ground of appeal.</p>
