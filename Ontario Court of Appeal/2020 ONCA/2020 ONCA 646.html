    assault. He appeals conviction only.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant advances two grounds of appeal.
    First, he submits his right to a fair trial was fatally compromised by several
    improper submissions made by Crown counsel in his closing address and by the
    trial judge’s failure to give the necessary correcting instructions. Second, the
    appellant submits the trial judge’s response to a question posed by the jury
    during its deliberations was wrong in law. He argues the trial judge’s response
    improperly narrowed the basis upon which the jury could be left with a
    reasonable doubt by excluding the possibility of a doubt based on the absence
    of evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would reject both

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant, R.W., and K.M. were good friends.
    Around midnight on June 16, 2017, K.M. invited R.W. over to her residence to
    party with K.M. and her new boyfriend, C.L. R.W. decided to go over to her
    friend’s house. She had been drinking before she left home. The drinking
    continued after she arrived at K.M.’s.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the early morning hours, K.M. spoke with the appellant
    and invited him to come over to pick up some of his belongings. K.M. and the
    appellant had previously dated. Apparently, the break-up had been difficult.
    R.W. knew the appellant through her friendship with K.M.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The drinking and partying continued after the
    appellant arrived. K.M. became very intoxicated and, according to her,
    eventually “blacked out”. R.W. described herself as “heavily intoxicated”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.L., who was not feeling well, did not drink as
    much as the others. He decided to go upstairs to bed around 5:30 a.m. After
    C.L. went upstairs, K.M. and the appellant began to “make out”. They had been
    flirting earlier in the evening. K.M. was very drunk.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to R.W., when she saw K.M. and the
    appellant “making out”, she went upstairs to get C.L. He came downstairs and
    took K.M. up to the bedroom with him, leaving R.W. and the appellant
    downstairs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neither R.W., nor the appellant, had shown any
    sexual interest in the other that night or at any other time. R.W. turned on a
    movie. She and the appellant watched the movie and had one or two drinks. R.W.
    fell asleep on a loveseat. The appellant was sitting on a couch in the same
    room.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.W. awoke sometime later, to find herself on
    her knees, facing the back of the loveseat. Her upper body was positioned on
    the loveseat. Her pants were down, exposing her buttocks. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.W. was initially confused. It took her some
    time to realize the appellant was behind her, trying to force his penis into
    her vagina. R.W. repeatedly said no and started to cry. Over the next several
    minutes, the appellant continued to attempt to force his penis into R.W. She
    cried out for help. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.L., who was sleeping upstairs with K.M., heard
    the scream. He went downstairs to find R.W. on her knees facing the loveseat
    with the appellant kneeling behind her. R.W.’s pants were down and she was
    crying. The appellant was making thrusting motions, consistent with an effort
    to have sexual intercourse with R.W. When the appellant saw C.L., he moved away
    from R.W. and put his penis back into his pants. C.L. demanded to know what was
    happening and told the appellant to leave. When the appellant refused, C.L.
    called the police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was arrested and taken to the
    police station. He told the police he recalled falling asleep on the couch. When
    he awoke, K.M. was on the floor next to the couch crying. R.W. was also on the
    floor crying. The appellant said he had no recollection of what happened, but repeatedly
    denied ever having any sexual contact with R.W. The appellant told the police
    R.W. was not sufficiently attractive for him to have had any sexual interest in
    her. He suggested R.W. may have “touched him” while he was sleeping.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the appellant testified and told a
    very different story. He admitted he had repeatedly lied to the police in his
    statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his testimony, the appellant indicated after
    C.L. took K.M. upstairs, he and R.W. had another drink and put on a movie. He
    passed out on the couch. The appellant woke up to find R.W. lying on the couch beside
    him, facing away from him. She was pressing her buttocks into his crotch. R.W.’s
    pants were “a little bit down”. The appellant said her name, but R.W. did not
    respond. The appellant, without saying anything more, pulled R.W.’s pants and
    underwear down and unbuttoned his pants, exposing his penis. He then made
    thrusting motions toward R.W., attempting to insert his penis into her vagina.
    He did not know if he succeeded. According to the appellant, R.W. made noises,
    which the appellant interpreted as an indication she was enjoying his efforts
    to have sex with her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified R.W. continued to grind
    her buttocks into his penis for some 10 or 15 minutes. After one particularly strong
    thrust by the appellant, R.W. rolled off the couch onto the floor. The
    appellant asked her if she wanted to stop and she said yes. He immediately
    pulled up his pants and sat on the couch. C.L. arrived in the living room from
    upstairs and asked what was going on. R.W. started to cry. C.L. told the
    appellant to leave and he refused. He told C.L. he had consensual sex with R.W.
    A short time later, the police arrived and arrested the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, with the agreement of counsel, the
    trial judge put two “defences” to the jury. He instructed the jury it must
    acquit the appellant unless the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt R.W. had
    not consented to the sexual activity. The trial judge also instructed the jury it
    must acquit unless the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt the appellant was
    not under the mistaken belief R.W. had consented to the sexual activity. On
    appeal, counsel for both the appellant and the Crown agree the “defence” of
    honest mistaken belief in consent was legally unavailable. The evidence gave no
    air of reality to a claim the appellant had taken reasonable steps in the
    circumstances known to him to determine whether R.W. was consenting to the
    sexual activity: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 273.2(b).</span></p>

    make submissions that are unavailable as a matter of law, or on the evidence.
    Nor can counsel misstate the evidence or the law. On occasion, counsel, usually
    unintentionally, fall into one or more of those errors. When they do, the trial
    judge may be required to provide a timely and focused correction. If counsel’s
    allegedly improper submissions become a ground of appeal, it falls to this
    court to decide whether those submissions, considered beside any correction
    provided by the trial judge, and in the context of the entire trial, resulted
    in a miscarriage of justice: see <em>R. v. Boudreau</em>, 2012 ONCA 830, at
    paras. 14-20; <em>R. v. L.(L.)</em> (2009), 96 O.R. (3d) 412, at paras. 50-54.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Before turning to the appellant’s specific
    submissions, it is also important to acknowledge the limits specifically
    imposed on Crown counsel in closing argument. While Crown counsel should firmly
    and fairly advance the case for the Crown, Crown counsel must do so in a
    measured manner, avoiding comments or behaviour that could be taken as inflammatory
    or an invitation to the jury to decide the case based on emotion or the
    personal opinion of Crown counsel: <em>R. v. Daley</em>, 1992 O.J. No. 1504; <em>R.
    v. L.(L.)</em>, at paras. 55-57.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was satisfied some of Crown
    counsel’s comments and his demeanour during parts of his closing address went
    beyond the kind of advocacy expected of the Crown. He told the jury so, in no
    uncertain terms. The trial judge firmly admonished the jury to approach the
    evidence “dispassionately and without emotion”, bearing in mind counsel’s
    personal opinions were irrelevant. This instruction ensured the improprieties
    in Crown counsel’s closing, identified by the trial judge, would not negatively
    impact on the fairness of the trial. The appellant does not suggest the trial
    judge did not adequately deal with this facet of Crown counsel’s closing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends, however, apart from the
    concerns identified by the trial judge, Crown counsel made four improper
    submissions which should have been addressed and specifically remedied by the
    trial judge. The appellant submits Crown counsel improperly:</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A jury cannot determine guilt simply by deciding
    which of two competing versions of the relevant events it believes. An accused
    must be acquitted if the jury has a reasonable doubt on any of the essential
    elements of the offence, even if the jury does not believe the accused’s
    version of events: <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397; <em>R. v.
    O.M.</em>, 2014 ONCA 503, at para. 42.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant accepts the trial judge correctly
    instructed the jury on how it should approach the appellant’s evidence in the
    context of applying the burden of proof. The trial judge followed the well known,
    three-step approach in <em>W.(D.)</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If you believe Ryan MacKenzie’s evidence that
    he did not commit the offence charged, you must find him not guilty. If, after
    a careful consideration of all the evidence, you are unable to decide who to
    believe, you must find Ryan MacKenzie not guilty, because Crown counsel would
    have failed to prove Ryan MacKenzie’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. And even
    if you don’t believe Ryan MacKenzie’s evidence, if it leaves you with a
    reasonable doubt about his guilt, or about an essential element of the offence
    charged, you must find him not guilty of sexual assault, and even if Ryan
    MacKenzie’s evidence does not leave you with a reasonable doubt of his guilt or
    about an essential element of the offence charged, you may only convict him if
    the rest of the evidence that you do accept, proves his guilt of the offence
    beyond a reasonable doubt. I will repeat that to you again tomorrow, just
    before you go to the jury room. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As he had promised, the trial judge repeated
    this instruction near the end of his instructions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues Crown counsel’s submissions
    invited the jury to take a different approach than the one described by the
    trial judge. The appellant contends fairness required the trial judge to specifically
    identify and correct the improper submission made by the Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reject this submission for two reasons. First,
    the trial judge told the jury, on more than one occasion, to take instructions
    on legal matters, like the burden of proof, from him only. If Crown counsel’s
    submission could be understood as advocating a different approach to the burden
    of proof, I see no reason to conclude the jury would disregard the trial
    judge’s instructions and follow the Crown’s suggested approach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, and more importantly, Crown counsel did
    not invite the jury to decide the case by choosing between the evidence of the
    appellant and the conflicting evidence of the Crown witnesses. To the contrary,
    Crown counsel specifically told the jury it must acquit the appellant, even if it
    did not believe him, unless the Crown proved his guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt. In his closing, Crown counsel used the same language from <em>R. v.
    W.(D.)</em>, as did the trial judge, in explaining the application of the
    burden of proof to the appellant’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is true Crown counsel forcefully urged the
    jury to disbelieve the appellant’s evidence. Crown counsel offered a variety of
    reasons for rejecting his evidence. In the impugned passage, Crown counsel argued
    the appellant’s evidence should be rejected because it conflicted with the
    evidence of other witnesses, particularly R.W. and C.L., who the Crown urged
    the jury to find were credible.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see nothing wrong with the argument advanced
    by the Crown. The credibility of any individual witness, including the accused,
    must, of necessity, be assessed having regard to all of the relevant evidence
    and the jury’s evaluation of the credibility of evidence given by other
    witnesses: <em>R. v. O.M.</em>, at para. 45.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel did not invite the jury to reach its
    verdict by choosing between competing versions of events. Instead, counsel
    urged the jury to disbelieve the appellant’s evidence, for several reasons,
    including what the Crown argued was the presence of cogent conflicting evidence
    from other credible witnesses. On the Crown’s argument, the appellant could be
    believed only if the others were disbelieved. For example, Crown counsel said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You cannot believe Ryan [the appellant]. You
    cannot. Cause if you believe him, then as a matter of logic you have to be
    forced to believe that K.M., C.L. and R.W. were all lying to you, with this
    perfectly crafted story, some conspiracy to make Ryan pay for no real reason,
    common to all three of them. Yes, Ryan, everyone’s out to get you.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although disbelief of the appellant, on its own,
    could not justify a conviction, and the Crown never suggested it could, the
    jury could not possibly convict the appellant if they did not disbelieve him.
    Not surprisingly, Crown counsel strenuously argued the jury should disbelieve
    the appellant for a variety of reasons, including the presence of conflicting
    evidence from other credible witnesses. In making this argument, Crown counsel neither
    suggested disbelief of the appellant equated with guilt, nor invited the jury
    to decide the case by choosing between competing versions of events.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did Crown counsel invite the jury to find R.W.
    had no motive to fabricate, and did he invite the jury to find the appellant’s
    failure to prove R.W. had a motive to fabricate was confirmatory of her
    credibility?</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his closing address, Crown counsel referred
    to the defence contention, R.W. was not merely mistaken or unreliable, but was
    deliberately lying about the relevant events. The Crown submitted to the jury, absent
    any evidence of a motive to lie, the jury should reject the defence argument. Crown
    counsel said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In Ryan’s [the appellant’s] version, R.W. is
    not remembering it wrong, she’s not mistaken, she’s full on lying to you. You
    have to accept that. Do you? You need a real reason to conclude this. You can’t
    speculate or conclude that people just do things for no reason. I, I’ve talked
    about this. There’s just no ring of truth to the idea she just likes to make
    criminal allegations and submit to sex assault kits for fun. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel then turned to the two possible motives
    to fabricate put forward by the defence. He argued neither made sense and
    neither had support in the evidence. In advancing this argument, Crown counsel
    was not purporting to instruct the jury on the law as it relates to a witness’s
    motive. Instead, he was making submissions to the jury challenging the merits
    of the defense position that R.W. had motives to fabricate the allegation
    against the appellant. The Crown argued there was no evidence R.W. had a motive
    to fabricate and, as a matter of common sense and human experience, the jury
    could conclude R.W. would not fabricate a serious allegation against the
    appellant if she had no reason for doing so.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was open to the jury to reject the motives to
    fabricate offered by the defence and to conclude there was no evidence of a
    motive to fabricate. If the jury took that view, the absence of any evidence of
    a motive to fabricate could be used as one factor in assessing R.W.’s
    credibility: see: <em>R. v. J.(H.)</em>, 2020 ONCA 165, at paras. 145-46.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his instructions, the trial judge told the
    jury a witness’s reason or motive for testifying a certain way was one of many
    factors to be considered in assessing the witness’s credibility. He did not
    elaborate and neither counsel asked him to elaborate. For example, the
    appellant did not ask the trial judge to explain the distinction between the absence
    of evidence of a motive and a proved absence of motive. I take it counsel at
    trial did not see the distinction as important to the defence case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Significantly, the trial judge said nothing to
    the jury to suggest there was no evidence R.W. had a motive to fabricate. To
    the contrary, he specifically reminded the jury of the motives put forward by
    the defence when summarizing the position of the defence. In doing so, the
    trial judge acknowledged R.W.’s motive, if any, for testifying the way she did,
    was very much in play and open to different interpretations on the evidence. Absent
    any objection by counsel, or any request for more detailed submissions
    concerning R.W.’s potential motives, I think the trial judge adequately
    addressed that issue in his instructions: see <em>R. v. J.(H.)</em>, at paras.
    150-55.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The argument Crown counsel invited the jury to put
    the onus on the defence to show the absence of a motive to fabricate relies on
    a single sentence in Crown counsel’s address. When discussing one of the
    motives offered by the defence as a reason for R.W. fabricating her evidence,
    Crown counsel said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It does not prove some motive to lie.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no onus on the defence to “prove” R.W.
    had a motive to lie. The single sentence uttered by the Crown during his
    closing would suggest otherwise if considered in isolation. However, bearing in
    mind the trial judge’s repeated and correct instructions on the burden of proof,
    and the manner in which he dealt with the relevance of a witness’s potential
    motive, I have no doubt the jury understood the Crown carried the burden of
    proof throughout and the defence had no obligation to prove anything, including
    R.W.’s motive. The jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the
    manner in which it should consider the evidence and submissions pertaining to R.W.’s
    alleged motives to fabricate her evidence: <em>R. v. Darnley</em>, 2020 ONCA
    179, at para. 38.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did Crown counsel improperly give evidence about
    the effect of alcohol consumption on human behaviour?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury heard a lot of evidence about drinking
    in the several hours before the alleged attack on R.W. K.M., R.W. and the
    appellant all consumed a significant amount of alcohol. R.W. described herself
    as very intoxicated. The defence claimed she overstated her degree of
    intoxication.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.W.’s alcohol consumption was relevant to her
    credibility and the reliability of her evidence in at least two ways. It
    potentially made her memory of the relevant events less reliable. It also potentially
    explained her actions and reactions during the sexual encounter. In the latter
    sense, R.W.’s degree of intoxication arguably cut both ways. Significant
    intoxication offered an explanation for how R.W. came to fall asleep and her
    very confused state in the moments after she awoke to find the appellant
    sexually assaulting her. However, R.W.’s significant degree of intoxication
    might also offer support for the inference, that because of her drinking, R.W.
    made a very bad decision to have sex with someone her friend cared for and who she
    hardly knew and quickly came to regret that bad decision. That scenario fit
    with one of the motives offered by the defence for R.W.’s false allegation
    against the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although R.W.’s degree of intoxication was a
    significant issue, it was not directly relevant to consent, the crucial issue
    in the case. The Crown did not allege R.W. lacked the capacity to consent
    because she was intoxicated. The Crown alleged R.W. did not consent because she
    was asleep when the appellant attacked and sexually assaulted her. As my
    colleague, Trotter J.A., concisely put it in oral argument, this was a case
    about consent, not capacity to consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant points to four references in Crown
    counsel’s closing, contending they amounted to the Crown giving evidence about
    the effects of alcohol consumption. I do not propose to review each separately.
    None are particularly controversial and none are consequential. There was no
    objection taken to any of Crown counsel’s comments about the effect of alcohol
    consumption. Trial counsel’s silence reflects the relative insignificance of
    Crown counsel’s comments. I see no possible prejudice to the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading9><span lang=EN-CA>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did Crown counsel improperly invite the jury to

    to his credibility?</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.W. testified that she met the appellant
    several times while he was dating K.M., but barely knew him. In his
    cross-examination, the appellant indicated he had known R.W. for about 12 years
    and did not agree with her suggestion that they had known each other for “a
    very brief time”. The appellant also pointed out that they were Facebook
    friends. It is fair to say, in his evidence, the appellant suggested he and R.W.
    knew each other better than R.W. had indicated in her testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s description of the nature of his
    relationship with R.W. led the Crown to ask him what he knew about R.W. The
    appellant referred to four things. The appellant agreed with the Crown’s
    suggestion R.W. had testified about those four things. Crown counsel asked if
    there was anything else the appellant knew about R.W. The appellant could offer
    nothing else.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his closing argument, Crown counsel submitted
    the appellant’s evidence about how well he knew R.W. did not have a ring of
    truth. Crown counsel said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I asked Ryan, tell me some things about R.W.
    If you’ve known her for 10 years, tell me some things. He told me four. She
    likes to play games on the computer and the Wii; she likes to drink; she has a
    boyfriend in New York; and that she was anti-social because of her anxiety
    issues. <span class=Underline>We all know that, all of us know that, we heard

    be present throughout his trial. To suggest the appellant tailored his evidence
    to conform with evidence heard at trial could turn the exercise of that
    constitutional right into a strike against the appellant’s credibility: see <em>R.
    v. Jorgge</em>, 2013 ONCA 485, at paras. 12-19.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel did not suggest the appellant had
    used his presence at trial to conform his evidence to evidence given earlier in
    the trial by R.W. Instead, Crown counsel cross-examined the appellant to suggest,
    contrary to the appellant’s evidence in-chief, he did not know R.W. very well
    at all. In an effort to make this point, Crown counsel cross-examined to demonstrate
    the appellant knew no more about R.W. than anybody who had been sitting at the
    trial and heard her testify. The appellant’s answers confirmed the Crown’s
    suggestion. In closing, the Crown advanced a legitimate argument for the jury’s
    consideration.</span></p>

    samples were typically sent to the Centre for Forensic Science (“CFS”) to test
    for the presence of drugs and/or alcohol. The jury did not hear any evidence
    the samples taken from R.W. were actually sent to the CFS or tested for
    blood/alcohol levels.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.W. was cross-examined on parts of her preliminary
    inquiry testimony. Those extracts included references to tests having been done
    by the CFS and results suggesting a high blood/alcohol level. None of those
    references, however, were admissible for the truth of their contents. The trial
    judge so instructed the jury soon after the jury heard the evidence making
    references to the preliminary inquiry transcript.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his jury charge, the trial judge summarized
    the evidence relevant to R.W.’s consumption of alcohol when addressing the
    issue of consent. The trial judge said, in part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>On the evidence, it’s clear she had consumed
    considerable alcohol during the early morning hours of June 17, 2017. On the
    other hand, the police officers who attended after the 911 call did not comment
    on her state of sobriety or the lack of ability to comprehend what was being
    discussed. There was no evidence offered of any signs of evident intoxication.
    The Crown did not produce the complainant’s hospital records to prove her
    blood/alcohol level at the time of attending at the hospital, or alternatively,
    to produce evidence the blood/alcohol readings were not taken. I remind you,
    again, the onus is at all times upon the Crown to prove all elements of the
    offence charged beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
