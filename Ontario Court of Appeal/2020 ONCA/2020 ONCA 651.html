  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Wesley Shortt, has been detained
    in forensic custody since March 7, 2007 after he was found NCR with respect to
    one count of uttering threats and one count of failure to comply with
    probation. He is currently detained at St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton (“Hospital”).
    Since at least 2014, the Ontario Review Board (“Board”) has repeatedly held
    that, at the discretion of the Person in Charge of the Hospital, Mr. Shortt is
    eligible to live in the community of Southern Ontario in accommodation approved
    by the Person in Charge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Shortt is eligible to live in a community
    residential setting if appropriate supports are provided. If this happens, his
    detention in forensic custody would not be necessary for public safety, nor would
    it advance any of the factors in s. 672.54 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unfortunately, this component of the Board’s
    dispositions for Mr. Shortt, consistent for the last six years, has not been
    implemented. While the Hospital continues to support Mr. Shortt’s integration
    into a community residential setting, he has not been integrated into a
    community setting because, despite its best efforts, the Hospital has been
    unable to locate a suitable setting or to obtain meaningful information from
    the Government of Ontario as to when such a setting might become available. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To break this impasse, Mr. Shortt applied for
    relief under the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> at his annual
    review hearing. He argued that his continued detention in forensic custody
    violated s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>. If successful on this argument, he sought
    a prospective remedy under s. 24(1) of the <em>Charter</em>, namely, state
    funding for suitable supportive housing as described by his treatment team at
    the Hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In a disposition dated July 23, 2019, the Board ordered,
    once again, that Mr. Shortt continue to be detained at the Hospital with
    permission to live in the Southern Ontario community at the discretion of the
    Person in Charge at the Hospital. In reasons dated August 20, 2019, the Board
    dismissed Mr. Shortt’s <em>Charter</em> application, allowing the impasse in
    implementing the community living provision to prevail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Shortt appeals the Board’s dismissal of his <em>Charter</em> application. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 10, 2006, Mr. Shortt, who was 26
    years old, was living with his parents in Guelph. During an argument, he
    threatened to kill his father. The police were called and Mr. Shortt was
    arrested. At the conclusion of his trial, Mr. Shortt was declared NCR; he has
    been detained in the forensic hospital system since then, a period of more than
    13 years.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Shortt has severe physical and intellectual disabilities.
    His weight and diminished mobility pose difficulties related to personal hygiene.
    His disabilities require specialized care and support. The Hospital has
    provided these throughout his detention. The members of his family who could
    offer support – his father, mother, sister and uncle – have all passed away
    while he has been in forensic detention. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to Mr. Shortt’s treatment team, despite
    being stable from a psychiatric perspective, the distress caused by his ongoing
    detention in a forensic hospital, in the face of six consecutive annual Board
    orders that he is eligible to reside in the community at the discretion of the
    Person in Charge of the Hospital, has caused Mr. Shortt to regress and engage
    in “primitive coping mechanisms.” In 2019, this court found that “the long wait
    for transition into appropriate alternative residential arrangements has
    created understandable frustration for Mr. Shortt. This has led to a
    deterioration in his progress”: <em>Shortt (Re),</em> 2019 ONCA 232, at para. 3. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board’s 2019 decision</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The Board’s 2019 decision concerned the
    annual review of Mr. Shortt’s case as well as his application for relief
    pursuant to ss. 7 and 24(1) of the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

lang=EN-CA>Board<em><span style='font-style:normal'> accepted the parties’
    joint submission that Mr. Shortt continued to be a significant threat to public
    safety and, accordingly, continued his previous disposition. This disposition
    required Mr. Shortt to be detained at the Hospital, with a range of privileges
    to be extended at the discretion of Person in Charge, including community
    living:</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>1.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> IT IS ORDERED that the accused be detained at Forensic Psychiatry
    Program of St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton, West 5th Campus, Hamilton.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>2.</span><span
lang=EN-CA> IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the person in charge of the St. Joseph’s
    Healthcare Hamilton, West 5th Campus create a program for the detention in
    custody and rehabilitation of the accused within the Forensic Psychiatry
    Program of St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton, West 5th Campus, in which the
    person in charge, in his or her discretion, may permit the accused:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(h) to live in the community of Southern
    Ontario in accommodation approved by the person in charge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the <em>Charter </em>application,
    Mr. Shortt claimed that his s. 7 right to liberty was breached as he has been
    eligible, and ready, to be placed in the community since 2014. The Hospital
    agrees that Mr. Shortt has been eligible and ready to live in the community
    with appropriate supports since 2014 and says that the only reason he has not
    been placed in a community residential setting is that its efforts to place him
    there have been met with roadblocks. Against this backdrop, Mr. Shortt advanced
    the argument that the appropriate remedy for the Government’s violation of his
    s. 7 right would be an order that the Government pay for his community housing
    and potential support personnel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board rejected Mr. Shortt’s <em>Charter </em>application,
    essentially for four reasons that it summarized in four headings:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The law is clear that procedural fairness

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The law is also clear on the limits of the Board’s

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Board finds that it does not have the

    remedies. As explained by Roberts J.A., at para. 16:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The role of the Board is to determine the
    appropriate disposition for each individual NCR accused person who appears
    before it. Its jurisdiction does not extend to the kind of systemic,

    specialized tribunal under Part XX.1 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> is the
    ongoing supervision of the treatment, assessment, detention and discharge of
    NCR accused persons in a “responsive, <em>Charter</em>-compliant fashion”, with
    the broad power to attach individualized conditions: <em>Conway</em>, at para.
    94; <em>Chaudry (Re)</em>, at para. 93. In particular, the Board can make

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, introducing the potential for

    and functions. The potential of a costs order would inevitably raise the stakes

    proceedings, and prolong Board hearings.  Consequently, if costs orders are
    available, hearings are likely to become more adversarial and less
    inquisitorial, with a shift in focus away from the twin goals of public safety
    and the fair treatment of NCR accused persons.  The Board’s expertise is in
    “how best to manage a patient’s risk to the public”: <em>Conway</em>, at para.
    95. Its expertise is not in assessing and fixing costs.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, this same reasoning applies to the
    question of damages. I see nothing in Part XX.1 that indicates that Parliament
    intended to empower the Board to make orders for damages. Just as in the case
    of claims for costs, the potential for making an order for damages would bring
    an adversarial tenor to Board hearings, which would detract from the inquisitorial
    approach the Board is to take and which would divert the Board’s attention from
    the twin goals of public safety and the fair treatment of NCR accused persons.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>We also agree, with respect to the opinion
    expressed in <em>Re Starz</em>, that there is no difference between the Board’s

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Funding orders serve a different purpose from

    would essentially replicate life in the Hospital but in a different location.

    can be placed no later than the end of 2020, provided of course that the Person

    difficulty is that, despite its best efforts, the Hospital has not been able to
    determine why an appropriate residential setting has not been made available
    for Mr. Shortt or even when one may be made available. As a result, Mr. Shortt
    has been languishing in the Hospital and his condition is starting to
    deteriorate, a development that stands as the antithesis to one of the ultimate
    purposes of the NCR scheme, to work safely toward the reintegration of NCR
    accused back into society. </span></p>

    Shortt’s liberty has been violated, and not in accordance with the principles
    of fundamental justice. Provided the Board determines that his condition
    continues to warrant the possibility of community living with support, the Government
    must respond immediately and meaningfully to this pressing need for implementation.
    The Government’s role at the next annual review hearing must be to identify
    precise implementation, not to contest it.</span></p>
