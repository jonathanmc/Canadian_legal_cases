  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the sentence imposed on November 10, 2016 by Justice Alan C.R. Whitten of the Superior Court of Justice with reasons at 2016 ONSC 5854.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Trotter J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Daryle Brown, attacked and raped
    a woman at random in August 2012. He entered a plea of guilty to aggravated
    sexual assault, contrary to s. 272(2)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46, and was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years, less credit for
    pre-sentence custody (“PSC”). He appeals his sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the sentencing judge
    failed to properly consider his Inuit heritage in accordance with <em>R. v.
    Gladue</em><i>, </i>[1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, and did not give effect to the
    principles of proportionality and restraint, resulting in a sentence that was
    unduly harsh. The respondent argues that the sentencing judge did not err in
    his consideration of <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>factors or in his application of
    sentencing principles.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the following reasons, I explain why I would
    grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. While I agree that the sentencing
    judge erred in his application of <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>principles, I am
    satisfied that the sentence he ultimately imposed is fit in the circumstances
    of this case.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='text-transform:none'>THE FACTS OF THE
    OFFENCE</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s attack on the victim took place in
    the early morning hours of August 9<sup>th</sup>, 2012 in Brantford, Ontario.
    The appellant had been drinking excessively the previous evening. He got into a
    fight with a group of men he encountered and sustained considerable injuries. The
    appellant said that he went home and lost consciousness after walking into a
    wall. Paramedics took him to the hospital where his blood alcohol level was
    measured at 198 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood. The
    appellant’s former foster mother drove him home from the hospital. He has no
    memory of what happened from this point forward.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At some point after being driven home, the
    appellant ventured out into the night. While out, the appellant found and
    followed two women as they walked to their respective homes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He began following the first woman after she
    left a coffee shop in downtown Brantford. Nervous about being followed, this
    woman walked towards a couple who were going the same way. The appellant
    continued to follow. The woman walked past the couple and went to a convenience
    store, but it was closed. She knew that the people who ran the convenience
    store lived in an adjoining house. She walked towards the house. The couple she
    had passed on the street walked in the same direction. Suddenly, the appellant
    appeared out of nowhere and moved towards her. However, he backed off when he
    noticed other people around. The couple realized the seriousness of the
    situation and took the woman to their home to retrieve their dog and a baseball
    bat. From their porch, they saw the appellant from a distance in the bushes. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Shortly after this disturbing encounter, the
    appellant turned his attention to the victim. She had just left her job at a
    restaurant to walk home. Suddenly, the appellant “jumped up” on her. He grabbed
    her by the neck and twisted her head from side to side. He bashed the victim’s
    head against some rocks and then choked her until she was unconscious. When the
    victim regained consciousness, she noticed that the assailant had removed her
    pants and underwear. She had been raped. The victim described feeling intense
    pain; as she said in her Victim Impact Statement: “It felt as though my head
    had been struck by a wrecking ball.” The appellant had also stolen the victim’s
    identification and credit cards, which were never recovered. She was able to
    get herself to safety at a nearby gas station, leaving a trail of blood behind.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The victim suffered horrible injuries. She
    required 100 stitches to her head. She had cuts and bruises on her face that
    caused her eyes to swell shut. She could not see for days, nor could she speak
    because her tongue was so swollen. The victim also suffered neck injuries,
    vertigo, and a torn rotator cuff. She remained in the hospital for a week. Even
    a year later, she was required to return to the doctor to have a rock fragment removed
    from her head. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The psychological impact on the victim was
    profound. She suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and has trouble
    sleeping. She is always on hyper-alert and afraid of social situations. In her
    Victim Impact Statement, the victim detailed the many ways that this attack impacted
    her day-to-day life. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='text-transform:none'>THE SENTENCING
    PROCEEDINGS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This case took a long time to resolve. It would
    not be until November 30<sup>th</sup>, 2015 that the appellant entered his
    guilty plea, more than three years after the offence. Another year passed while
    the Crown considered commencing dangerous offender proceedings under Part XXIV
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. Ultimately, the Crown decided not to pursue this
    course. Nonetheless, a great deal of information was gathered about the
    appellant. The sentencing judge received a Pre-Sentence Report (“PSR”), a <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>Report, and a psychological assessment. The appellant also testified during
    the sentencing hearing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>From the information gathered, a picture emerged
    of a person who had endured a very difficult upbringing. The PSR summarized the
    appellant’s history as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The subject was raised in an unstable home and
    negative environment. His mother was an alcoholic, he had no relationship with
    his biological father and lacked a positive father figure. He was a victim and
    a witness to violence in the home. He was neglected by his mother and was
    placed into care as a youth. The subject has no support from his family members
    but does have positive support from his ex-partner and past foster mother.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While in care, the appellant had his first
    encounter with the criminal justice system. He was convicted of sexual assault
    and mischief in relation to a foster sister. He testified at the sentencing
    hearing that the touching was accidental and that he entered a plea of guilty on
    the advice of his lawyer.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was 25 years old when he was
    sentenced for the offence before the court. By that point, he had children of
    his own. He is currently 29.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the sentencing hearing, there was evidence
    that the appellant accepted responsibility for his actions, even though he had
    no memory of them. He also expressed remorse. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is clear that alcohol played some role in the
    offence. The degree to which the appellant struggles with alcohol in general is
    less clear, owing to his inconsistent reporting on his relationship with
    alcohol. However, the preponderance of information suggested that the appellant
    has an alcohol problem. He attended a number of treatment programs for alcohol
    dependency while in PSC, including Alcoholics Anonymous. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There were serious concerns about recidivism in this
    case. There is still no explanation for the events of that night. The trigger
    of the appellant’s behaviour remains unknown. Accordingly, it is unsurprising
    that the psychological assessment of the appellant revealed that he had a
    “moderate to moderate-high risk to re-offend in a sexual manner.” Likewise, a
    psychiatrist concluded that he was a “high-moderate risk to re-offend.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An issue that eluded clarity at the proceedings related
    to the appellant’s lineage. After receiving the <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>Report,
    the Crown disputed the appellant’s assertion that he is indeed Inuit. He
    submitted that establishing one’s Indigenous heritage is a pre-condition to the
    application of principles established in <i>Gladue</i> and subsequent cases.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Understandably, a good deal of the appellant’s
    knowledge about his heritage came from his mother and the person the appellant
    believes is his father: Lyle Thompson. Mr. Thompson is Inuit. The appellant’s
    mother and other family members have insisted to the appellant that Mr.
    Thompson is his biological father. Confusion arose because the father of the
    appellant’s step-sister, Darren Lamb, who apparently is not Indigenous, signed
    the appellant’s birth certificate as his father. The appellant testified that,
    by the time he was born, Mr. Thompson was no longer in the picture and his
    mother was with Mr. Lamb. According to the appellant, Mr. Lamb signed his birth
    certificate without his mother’s knowledge. The appellant said in his
    testimony: “My mom was with Darren Lamb when I was born and that’s about it.
    That’s all I know.” Mr. Lamb has never told the appellant that he is his
    father.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant met Mr. Thompson when he was 18.
    He testified that they share the same facial characteristics, hair colour, and
    skin tone. He learned that he has two half-sisters and one half-brother from
    his father.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant relayed to the author of the <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>Report an argument he had with Mr. Thompson long ago, which ended with Mr.
    Thompson telling him: “You’re not my son so fuck off.” The Crown relied heavily
    upon this utterance in maintaining that <em>Gladue</em> principles did not
    apply. The appellant testified that this comment was said in the throes of
    anger. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The author of the Gladue Report interviewed the
    appellant’s aunt; an aunt whom he had never met, and who was Mr. Thompson’s
    sister. She relayed that she and Mr. Thompson are Inuit from the Western Arctic.
    Their family has a deep history of trauma stemming from colonial state policies.
    The appellant’s aunt reported that both of her parents spent the majority of
    their childhoods and adolescences in residential school. Likewise, Mr. Thompson
    and the appellant’s aunt were forcibly separated from their family and
    community while they were children. She had attended residential school and Mr.
    Thompson was “scooped” in the 1970’s; that is, he was adopted into a
    non-Indigenous family. According to the appellant’s aunt, Mr. Thompson
    struggled with identity issues and had trouble connecting with his family when
    he eventually returned for visits.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s testimony created further
    confusion when he said that his mother has Métis heritage. The appellant did
    not relay this information to the author of the <em>Gladue</em> Report.  In his
    testimony, the appellant explained that, at the time that he was interviewed by
    the <em>Gladue</em><i> </i>Report writer, he did not know about his mother’s
    lineage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unfortunately, neither the appellant’s mother
    nor Mr. Thompson were able to testify at the sentencing hearing. Both were in
    British Columbia at the time and unable to get to Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Another issue to be resolved was the question of
    credit for time spent in PSC. The appellant testified about the conditions he
    experienced while in PSC. He was triple-bunked on occasion, in cells with no
    toilets. This resulted in inmates having to call a guard to be escorted to the
    washroom. If an inmate could not wait, he would urinate into a used potato chip
    bag, a towel, or on the floor.</span></p>

    misapplied the principles in <i>Gladue</i> by concluding that the seriousness
    of his offending precluded the consideration of his Inuit background. The
    appellant relies on the following passage from the sentencing judge’s reasons,
    at paras. 72-73, which was the last thing he said about this issue:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Having observed that there is minimal

    he committed</u>.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In <i>R. v. Gladue</i>, at paras. 78-80, the

    that, as a practical reality, the seriousness of the offence demands a sentence
    of imprisonment, irrespective of the person’s aboriginal heritage. <u>In other
    words, any effort to distinguish the circumstances of the aboriginal becomes
    eclipsed by the circumstances of the offence.</u> This is such a case.

lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the error lies in

    79:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Yet, even where an offence is considered

    13, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433, the Supreme Court clarified whether <i>Gladue </i>applies
    to sentencing decisions for violent or serious offences. Writing for the
    majority, LeBel J. observed that courts have misunderstood the above quoted
    passage from <i>Gladue</i>.  As he wrote, at paras. 84-85:</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Whatever criticisms may be directed at the
    decision of this Court for any ambiguity in this respect, the judgment
    ultimately makes it clear that sentencing judges have a&nbsp;<i>duty</i>&nbsp;to
    apply s. 718.2(<i>e</i>): “There is no discretion as to whether to consider the
    unique situation of the aboriginal offender; the only discretion concerns the
    determination of a just and appropriate sentence” (<i>Gladue</i>, at para. 82).

    issues are somewhat moot because of the seriousness of the offence” – out of
    context. The respondent presents a different interpretation of this statement:
    what the sentencing judge was really saying was, whether the appellant was in
    fact an Indigenous offender was “moot”, because he was prepared to assume that
    he was Indigenous for the purposes of sentencing. </span></p>

    sentencing judge was alleged to have made the same error in this case. The
    court rejected this submission. As Brown J.A. said, at para. 84: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While the sentencing judge’s reasons would
    have benefitted from a reference to&nbsp;<i>Ipeelee’s</i>&nbsp;clarification

    lacked that completeness. For example, this court in&nbsp;<i>R. v. Fraser</i>,
    2016 ONCA 745, referred to the passage in&nbsp;<i>Gladue</i>&nbsp;about the
    seriousness of the offence without also mentioning&nbsp;<i>Ipeelee</i>: at

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge's reasons reveal an
    in-depth appreciation of the remedial purposes of <i>Gladue</i>. He recognized
    that s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is “designed to address the
    overrepresentation of aboriginals in the prison system.” He also commented on how
    colonial policies, such as residential schools and the phenomenon of
    “scooping”, resulted in “the destruction of aboriginal culture and the social
    handicapping of aboriginal peoples”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge also understood that these
    circumstances must be taken into consideration in the sentencing of an
    Indigenous offender, noting that: “Jurists must recognize the negative aspects
    of this colonization on the lives of aboriginal offenders appearing before
    them.” He specifically referred to <i>Ipeelee</i> for the proposition that
    courts must consider background factors that may have played a role in the
    offence coming before the court, without requiring “the offender to establish a
    direct causal link between his circumstances.” It was from this vantage point
    that the sentencing judge evaluated the appellant’s asserted Inuit heritage. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the sentencing judge’s application of
    this important framework became distorted by his reference to the mootness of
    the appellant’s lineage as it related to the severity of the offence. The
    impugned passage suggests that it did not really matter whether the appellant
    was Inuit because it could have no effect  on the sentence. As discussed below,
    although the appellant’s Inuit heritage may not have had any tangible impact on
    the sentence imposed, it was still important to the mode of analysis required
    by the <i>Gladue</i> line of cases.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It would have been preferable had the trial
    judge: (1) made an explicit finding about the appellant’s parentage; and (2) if
    satisfied that <i>Gladue</i> was in play, applied the principles in accordance
    with <i>Gladue</i> and <i>Ipeelee</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for parentage, the respondent is correct that
    the sentencing judge seemed prepared to assume, for the purpose of the <i>Gladue </i>analysis, that Mr. Thompson was the appellant’s father and that the
    appellant had Inuit heritage. The sentencing judge addressed the conflicting evidence
    around the appellant’s identity as follows, at para. 69:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The jurist has to take a practical approach to
    ensure that the <i>Gladue </i>principles are honoured. The inconsistent
    evidence as to the parentage of Mr. Brown, and his lack of aboriginal documentation,
    may very well be a function of his obviously chaotic childhood flowing from
    having an alcoholic mother with several partners. It also may be due to
    inconsistent recording of lineage, since a big component of aboriginal history
    is oral. To compel Mr. Brown to provide direct documentary evidence, even to
    establish on a balance of probabilities his parentage, simply may not be
    realistic or doable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see no error in this approach. The appellant
    has been told his whole life that Mr. Thompson was his father. There is no
    other reason that the appellant would have tracked down Mr. Thompson when he
    was 18. Moreover, to require the appellant to prove his heritage in these
    circumstances would create an undue evidentiary burden that is inconsistent
    with the overarching remedial purposes of s. 718.2(e). Again, it would have
    been preferable had the sentencing judge made an explicit factual finding on
    this issue. Nonetheless, I would likewise proceed on the same basis that the
    appellant is of Inuit heritage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In terms of the application of <i>Gladue</i> principles, I am satisfied that the sentencing judge made the <i>Ipeelee </i>error
    that the appellant identifies. With respect, I cannot accept the respondent’s
    interpretation of the passage from the sentencing judge’s reasons, reproduced
    in para. 32, above. The appellant’s submission is not predicated on a single
    phrase, as the respondent submits. The “somewhat moot” passage was followed by
    a paragraph that cited the very part of <i>Gladue</i> that was clarified in <i>Ipeelee. </i>The sentencing judge concluded that paragraph by saying that the
    circumstances related to the appellant’s Indigeneity were “eclipsed” by the
    circumstances of the offence in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The gravity of the offence did not, and could
    not, render the circumstances relating to the appellant’s Indigenous heritage “moot”.
    Rather, <i>Gladue </i>and its progeny prescribe a different method of analysis
    in determining a fit sentence for Indigenous offenders, which must be followed
    regardless of the severity of the offence at hand: <i>Ipeelee, </i>para. 59. Put
    another way, the <i>impact</i> of <i>Gladue </i>factors may vary in any given
    case but the method of analysis does not. The application of <i>Gladue </i>factors
    is always necessary to achieve a proportionate sentence for Indigenous
    offenders, and a failure to do so warrants appellate intervention: <i>R. v.
    Swampy,</i> 2017 ABCA 134, 347 C.C.C. (3d) 105,<i> </i>at paras. 26 and 36; <i>Ipeelee</i>,
    at para. 44. Considering the sentencing judge’s words at face value, and in the
    context of his reasons as a whole, I am left to conclude that he failed to adhere
    to this aspect of the <i>Gladue </i>principles. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That said, this type of error is not necessarily
    fatal. Granted, the sentencing judge’s reasons are not entitled to the customary
    appellate deference that they would normally attract; this court is required to
    consider the fitness of sentence afresh: see <i>R. v. F.H.L.</i>, 2018 ONCA 83,
    360 C.C.C. (3d) 189, at para. 36; <i>R. v. Collins</i>, 2011 ONCA 182, 104 O.R.

    at para. 20. However, a re-assessment on appeal need not lead to a different
    outcome: see <i>F.H.L.</i>, at paras. 36-37; <i>R. v. Kakekagamick</i> (2006),
    81 O.R. (3d) 664, at para. 58, leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 34;

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Courts are required to take judicial notice of

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-GB>Although systemic and background factors

    his father’s absence played a role in the appellant’s traumatic upbringing, the
    tumultuous nature of his childhood is more likely attributed elsewhere. His
    mother struggled with alcoholism and had a series of abusive partners, one of
    whom apparently strangled him to the point of unconsciousness on multiple
    occasions. He had his first drink at age seven, at the behest of one of his
    mother’s partners. He recalls lacking proper food and clothing. The Children’s
    Aid Society apprehended the appellant at the vulnerable age of 10. He had
    limited contact with his biological mother for the remainder of his
    adolescence. </span></p>

    likely attributed to an unstable and abusive home that went well beyond any
    impact of the appellant’s father. It did not rise from the general to the
    specific in a way that diminished his moral culpability to a degree that it
    ought to have any impact on the sentence imposed: see <i>Altiman</i>, at para
    114. This was a case that required a sentence driven by the principles of
    denunciation and deterrence: see <i>F.H.L.</i>, at paras. 50-51. </span></p>

    2010 SCC 6, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 42, LeBel J. described
    proportionality as serving a limiting or restraining function. He also observed
    that proportionality aligns with a just deserts approach to sentencing, which
    requires that an offender be held accountable and that “</span><span
lang=EN-CA>the sentence properly reflects and condemns their role in the
    offence and the harm they caused”: para. 42. Synthesizing these conceptual
    strands, LeBel J. explained, at para. 42: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Whatever the rationale for proportionality,
    however, the degree of censure required to express society's condemnation of
    the offence is always limited by the principle that an offender's sentence must
    be equivalent to his or her moral culpability, and not greater than it. <u>The
    two perspectives on proportionality thus converge in a sentence that both
    speaks out against the offence and punishes the offender no more than is
    necessary</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    account the wrongfulness and harmfulness of sexual offences against children
    when applying the proportionality principle. Accurately understanding both
    factors is key to imposing a proportionate sentence.” There is no reason to
    think that it does not also apply to sexual offences at large. </span><span
lang=EN>As the Supreme Court observed, “taking the harmfulness of these

lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the sentencing judge did not make
    specific reference to the principle of proportionality. However, reading his
    reasons as a whole, it is evident that he properly balanced the elements that
    drive proportionality. He was aware of the appellant’s unfortunate background,
    as well as his difficult relationship with alcohol, which appeared to have been
    a factor on the night that he attacked the victim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, these circumstances were clearly
    overtaken by the gravity of the offence and the harm that it caused. The
    appellant stalked two randomly-chosen women that night. One got away; the other
    did not. As the sentencing judge said, the attack was horrific, with
    devastating physical and psychological repercussions for the victim. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the harm caused by this type of
    offending – when women are attacked at random – is far-reaching. A random
    attack on an innocent stranger shakes the community. It breeds fear that anyone
    is a potential target. This is rightly considered an aggravating factor in
    sentencing: see <i>R. v. Henderson, </i>2018 ONSC 3550 at p. 15; <i>R. v.
    Trumpa, </i>2017 ONSC 5966, at para. 27; <i>R. v. K.T., </i>[2002] OJ No. 4649
    (OCJ), at paras. 18, 24. This feature of the appellant’s offending adds to his
    moral blameworthiness through the harm that it caused. It naturally calls for a
    sentence that emphasizes denunciation and deterrence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Relatedly, the sentencing judge observed that

    appellant’s minimal criminal record and sentencing history, the sentence
    imposed did not reflect the appropriate degree of restraint. The appellant
    points to the fact that he accepted responsibility for committing the offence,
    a prison chaplain described him as a “model inmate”, and the appellant was
    committed to rehabilitating himself by engaging in prison programs, including
    Alcoholics Anonymous. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The sentencing judge noted these factors in his
    reasons. However, he was dubious of the appellant’s sincerity, especially in
    light of the psychological report that suggested the appellant’s self-reporting
    may not be accurate because of a “trait like tendency towards positive
    impression management”. In other words, the appellant has a reluctance “to acknowledge
    personal shortcomings that most would admit to.” </span></p>

    nature of the attack, the sentencing judge was right to place great emphasis on
    the principles of general deterrence and denunciation, over that of restraint. As
    this court said in <i>R. v. Reesor</i>, 2019 ONCA 901, at para. 8: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The principle of restraint, like all
    principles of sentencing, operates in conjunction with other principles that
    often pull in a different direction. For offences like this, particularly
    committed in the context of domestic violence, the restraint principle must, as
    the trial judge noted, yield, to a large degree, to concerns associated with
    deterrence, denunciation and protection of the victim. A significant
    penitentiary sentence was necessary in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>The same approach was warranted in the

lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no doubt that the appellant received a
    significant custodial sentence. However, the circumstances in this case
    undeniably called for it. The cases from this court that the sentencing judge
    cited (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>Last</i>, <i>Kavanaugh</i>, and <i>Anderson</i>) justify
    the approach of the sentencing judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant attempts to distinguish these

    is difficult to compare sentences in the disparate circumstances of offences
    and offenders.” There are some differences between this case and the cases
    cited by the sentencing judge. However, they share an important similarity with
    this case: they all call out for exemplary sentences that properly reflect the
    wrongfulness inherent in sexual violence, and the harm that it causes to the
