    four counts of child luring contrary to s. 172.1(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, and one count of making sexually explicit images
    available to a child contrary to s. 171.1(1)(b) following a trial by judge
    alone. The charges arose from the appellant’s exchanges over the internet with someone
    who claimed to be a 14-year-old girl named “Jenny”, but who was really an
    undercover police officer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the appellant’s conviction, the Supreme
    Court of Canada released its decision in <em>R. v. Morrison</em>, 2019 SCC 15,
    [2019] 2 S.C.R. 3, significantly clarifying the legal framework for the offence
    of child luring.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant advances several grounds of
    appeal. His principal ground is that his convictions cannot stand in view of <em>Morrison. </em>He claims the trial judge erred — though understandably — by applying the
    pre-<em>Morrison</em> legal framework to the charges against him and, but for
    these errors, the Crown had not established beyond a reasonable doubt the
    appellant knew or believed his interlocutor, “Jenny”, was under 16. The Crown responds
    that the trial judge’s error in applying the pre-<em>Morrison</em> legal
    framework was harmless, and in any event, the convictions should be maintained
    because of the overwhelming evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the appellant. Based on the <em>Morrison </em>ground alone, I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions, and
    order a new trial on all counts.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The charges against the appellant arose from an
    undercover police sting operation. The appellant, who was then 53 years old, posted
    an ad on the Casual Encounters section of Craigslist in April 2014 stating, “I
    would like to fuck a young woman doesn’t matter what nationality but would
    prefer under a 110 lbs.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A police officer responded to the ad, posing as
    a 14-year-old girl named “Jenny” weighing 90 lbs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over the next two months, the appellant sent “Jenny” links to
    pornography websites, asked her whether she had had her period yet, requested nude
    photographs of her, commented on her “sexy” body, wanted to know whether she had
    masturbated, stated that he would like <span style='color:black'>to put </span>his
    tongue all over her body and make her “feel like a woman,” and said that “if we
    meet on Wednesday and im not to gross for you can I touch your little butt
    [sic].” The appellant sent a photo of himself to “Jenny” and offered to send her
    photos of his penis. “Jenny” sent the appellant clothed “selfies” that did not
    reveal her face, though these were actually photos of a 24-year-old police
    officer who weighed 120 lbs.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police identified the appellant’s IP address and used it to locate
    his home address. They attended at his residence with a search warrant and
    found him at home. They then questioned him without advising him of his right
    to counsel immediately, which the Crown conceded breached his rights under s.
    10(b) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Canadian</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>of
    Rights and Freedoms</span></em>. After the appellant was cautioned and arrested,
    he <span style='color:black'>made further statements to </span>the police, some
    of which were inculpatory.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>At trial, the </span>appellant testified that
    he had joined Craigslist to relate better to his coworkers, who frequented
    Craigslist’s Casual Encounters section for entertainment. He also testified he
    thought “Jenny” was a coworker playing a joke on him and that he believed she was
    really an adult male. The appellant claimed his exchanges with “Jenny” involved
    role-playing.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial
    judge found the appellant’s evidence was “simply not credible”: at para. 230.
    He found the appellant’s evidence <span style='color:black'>that </span>he did
    not believe “Jenny” was younger than 18 was not to be believed and did not raise
    a reasonable doubt: at para. 235.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the law as it stood before <em><span lang=EN-CA>Morrison</span></em>, the trial
    judge held the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant
    believed the other party to the chats was under the age of 16: at paras.
    236-49. This conclusion is the main target of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='color:black'>Lastly, </span>the trial judge held the Crown had established
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the specific subjective intent
    to facilitate the commission of sexual offences against a child: at paras. 250-57.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was therefore persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    appellant (1) communicated with a person whom he believed was a 14-year-old
    girl to facilitate the commission of a sexual offence, which established his
    guilt for the four counts of child luring contrary to s. 172.1(1); and (2) used
    his computer to communicate with “Jenny”, a person he believed to be 14 years
    old, to <span style='color:black'>make available </span>to her sexually
    explicit material, which established his guilt for making sexually explicit
    images available to a child contrary to s. 171.1(1)(b): at paras. 258-59.</p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Legal Framework for Child Luring Before

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Morrison</em>, <em>per</em> Moldaver J., the
    Supreme Court clarified the legal framework for the offence of child luring. The
    essential elements of that framework as it stood before and after <em>Morrison</em> were recently distilled by Watt J.A. in <em>R.&nbsp;v.</em></span><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>&nbsp;</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Drury</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2020 ONCA 502, at paras. 49-60.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before <em>Morrison</em>, in prosecutions for
    child luring where the other person was represented to the accused as underage,
    the case law provided two independent pathways to conviction under s. 172.1(1):
    the Crown had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused either
    (1) believed the other person was under the age of 16, or (2) failed to take
    reasonable steps to ascertain the other person’s age: <em>Morrison</em>, at
    paras. 28, 49; <em>Drury</em>, at para. 55.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Morrison</em>, the Court held that the presumption
    of belief in age under s.&nbsp;172.1(3) of the <em>Criminal Code</em> unjustifiably infringes s. 11(d) of the <em>Charter</em> and is therefore of no
    force or effect: at paras. 11, 73. In the absence of the presumption, failing to
    take reasonable steps no longer provides an independent pathway to conviction.
    It merely limits when the accused may invoke as a defence <span
style='color:black'>that </span>they believed the other person was of legal
    age: <em>Morrison</em>, at paras. 80, 82. As noted in <em>Drury</em>, “[t]he
    accused’s belief must be affirmatively established without the assistance of
    the presumption — that is, by evidence adduced at trial establishing the
    requisite belief beyond a reasonable doubt”: at para. 57.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, after <em>Morrison</em>, in a prosecution
    under s. 172.1(1) in the context of a police sting where there is no underage
    person, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt three essential
    elements: (i) an intentional communication by means of telecommunication; (ii) with
    a person whom the accused believes is under the requisite age; and (iii) <span
style='color:black'>for the purpose of facilitating the commission </span>of a
    designated offence <span style='color:black'>with respect to </span>that person: <em>Morrison</em>, at para. 95; <em>Drury</em>, at para. 59. To establish the
    second element, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
    either believed or was wilfully blind to whether the interlocutor was underage: <em>Morrison</em>, at paras. 96-97; <em>Drury</em>, at para. 60. Recklessness
    as to the interlocutor’s age does not suffice: <em>Morrison</em>, at paras. 100&#8209;1; <em>Drury</em>, at para. 60.</span></p>

    reasons must be evaluated by asking whether he convicted the appellant of child
    luring in a manner consistent with the legal framework later enunciated in <em>Morrison</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims the trial judge erred by
    applying the pre-<em>Morrison</em> legal framework. He claims the trial judge erroneously
    relied on the evidentiary presumption of belief in age under s. 172.1(3), and
    concluded that because the appellant had failed to rebut that presumption, the
    Crown had proved the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant
    thus asserts that the trial judge relied on the second independent pathway to
    conviction that <em>Morrison</em> eliminated. He says this case is just like <em>Drury</em>,
    where Watt J.A. concluded, at paras. 64-65, that the trial judge in that case erred
    by relying on the presumption of belief in the interlocutor’s age, based on a
    representation <span style='color:black'>that </span>they were underage, “to
    establish or even help establish” the accused’s belief that the interlocutor
    was underage. The appellant highlights para. 65 of <em>Drury</em> in particular:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Proof that the appellant believed or was
    wilfully <span style='color:black'>blind to the fact that Tiffany was </span>under
    16 was an essential element of the offence charged. <u>The Crown <span
style='color:black'>was not entitled to invoke </span>the presumption of belief
    from the underage representation to establish or even help establish this
    essential element. Nor was it entitled to rely upon the absence of reasonable
    steps to negate any evidence to the contrary or to afford a discrete pathway to
    conviction</u>. The trial judge, <span style='color:black'>quite </span>understandably,
    adopted this <span style='color:black'>approach in light of </span>the existing
    jurisprudence. After </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Morrison</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, however, a finding of guilt recorded on these bases can no longer
    stand. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, the Crown accepts the trial judge relied
    on the evidentiary presumption of age to convict the appellant, but claims the
    presumption was superfluous to his reasoning because he also concluded, independently
    of the presumption, that the Crown had proved the appellant knew “Jenny” was
    underage. The Crown highlights para. 242 of the trial judge’s reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[242] Regarding [the appellant’s knowledge or
    belief that his interlocutor was underage], I find the Crown has the benefit of
    the presumption under s. 172.1(3). <u>In addition</u>, I find the Crown has the
    benefit of the overwhelming evidence at this trial that Mr. Allen thought he
    was talking to a 14 year-old and the almost complete absence of anything
    credible to the contrary. [Emphasis added.]<a name="_Hlk51754299"></a></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown contends the underlined words “[i]n
    addition” confirm the evidentiary presumption in the previous sentence was
    superfluous, because there was an independent basis for the trial judge to
    convict the appellant: the overwhelming evidence that the appellant thought he
    was talking to a 14-year-old.</span></p>

    arguable that the evidentiary presumption — which was invoked by the Crown and applied
    by the trial judge — was superfluous. But para. 242 cannot be read in
    isolation. It foreshadows the trial judge’s conclusion at para. 249 that the
    Crown had established the appellant’s belief that “Jenny” was underage. The trial
    judge’s reasons for this conclusion are explained in paras. 243-49, which rely
    on the lack of reasonable steps six times and confirm that the trial judge
    determined that the Crown proved the appellant’s belief about “Jenny’s” age through
    the appellant’s failure to rebut the evidentiary presumption by taking reasonable
    steps — the second pathway to conviction that <em>Morrison</em> foreclosed:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par243>243</a>]  Mr. Allen expressed

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par244>244</a>]  I find the most

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[<a name=par245>245</a>]  Although Mr. Allen

    was underage. He thus erroneously applied the pre-<em>Morrison</em> legal

    believed the interlocutor was underage “without reference to the presumption”:

    then applied the presumption of belief in represented age to reach the same

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant responds that Watt J.A. refused to
    apply the proviso in <em>Drury</em>. He ruled the trial judge’s error in applying
    the pre-<em>Morrison</em> legal framework to the conviction of child luring in

lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the appellant. In my view, it cannot
    be said that the error in applying an unconstitutional evidentiary presumption
    to establish guilt was “so harmless or minor that it could not have had any
    impact on the verdict”: <em>R. v. Van</em>, 2009 SCC 22, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 716,
    at para. 34. As in <em>Drury</em>, the appellant’s belief of his interlocutor’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor can it be said that the evidence of the
    appellant’s guilt was “so overwhelming that any other verdict would have been
    impossible to obtain”: <em>Van</em>, at para. 34. This high standard is met
    only “if the case against the accused was so overwhelming that a reasonable and
    properly instructed jury would inevitably have convicted”, and “any possible
    measure of doubt concerning the strength of the Crown’s case [must be afforded]
    to the benefit of the accused person”: <em>Van</em>, at para. 36.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the appellant testified and the
    case turned on his credibility. He explained why he believed that “Jenny” was
    an adult, including his belief that the selfie “Jenny” sent him was of an adult
    — which turned out to be correct. A reasonable and properly instructed jury may
    have believed the appellant’s evidence that he believed he was engaged in
    role-play with an adult. In all the circumstances, a verdict other than guilt
    was not impossible. I therefore conclude that this is not an overwhelming case
    that justifies applying the proviso.</span></p>
