  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the convictions entered
    on June 11, 2018 by Justice Louise L. Gauthier of the Superior Court of Justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual interference and two
    counts of assault against his stepson. The appellant was also found guilty on two
    counts of sexual assault for which stays were entered. The appellant was
    sentenced to 6 years imprisonment. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The complainant was a child aged six to nine years at the time of
    the alleged offences. When he was he was a young teenager, he disclosed that
    the appellant had sexually and physically abused him. He was 16 years old at
    the time of trial. He testified to two instances of sexual abuse. The first
    instance occurred in his bedroom when the appellant stroked his penis and
    sodomized him. The second occurred in a car inside the garage when he was again
    sodomized. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2015, the same year that the allegations were made and four years
    after the relationship between the appellant and the complainant’s mother
    ended, the appellant sent an apology to the complainant over Facebook for what
    had happened in the past. The Facebook messages were not available at trial,
    but the appellant and the complainant referred to them. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant alleges that, in convicting him, the trial judge erred by:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>misapprehending
    the appellant’s explanation for the Facebook apology;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>reversing
    the onus of proof; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failing to
    resolve inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>The apology</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he saw his photo on the Facebook page of
    the complainant’s mother. He wanted it deleted and began arguing with her. She
    blocked him. The appellant then turned to the complainant on Facebook and
    requested that he tell his mother to delete the photo. In the same series of
    messages, the appellant apologized to the complainant. He testified that the
    apology was for the offensive things he said to the complainant’s mother about
    her deceased children and for having spoken to the complainant in a “higher
    tone of voice.” </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not believe the appellant’s explanation for the
    apology. She found it “incomprehensible” that he was apologizing for the tone
    of his voice some four or five years earlier. The appellant submits that this
    was a misapprehension because he was also apologizing for the offensive things
    he said about the deceased children. The appellant argues that this
    misapprehension was integral to the trial judge’s reasoning since it
    effectively turned the apology into an admission of guilt.  </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not agree. It was open to the trial judge to disbelieve the
    appellant. Her rejection of his explanation was in the context of her
    credibility assessment and she did not link it to an admission of guilt. </p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Onus of proof</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge did not apply <em>R. v.
    W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742<em> </em>and consequently reversed the burden
    of proof. He relies on the highlighted portion of the following paragraph from
    the trial judge’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>For the above reasons, I reject the accused’s evidence.  It
    does not raise a reasonable doubt. <span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>Likewise,
    the balance of the evidence, including the frailties of [the complainant’s]
    evidence, do not leave me with a reasonable doubt that the accused committed
    the offences as charged</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>. </span>[Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge was placing an onus on him to
    disprove his guilt by deciding first that the appellant’s guilt had been proved
    beyond a reasonable doubt and <em>then</em> assessing the inconsistencies. Again,
    we disagree. While the trial judge did not refer to <em>W.D.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> directly, she did refer to its three component
    parts. In addition, while we acknowledge that</span></em> the above paragraph
    could have been better worded, the reasons read as a whole make it clear that the
    trial judge was aware of the burden of proof and did not place an onus on the
    appellant. Also, in convicting the appellant, she added:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In conclusion, after having considered all the evidence, I am
    satisfied the Crown has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt….</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Failure to resolve inconsistencies</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to resolve the inconsistencies in
    the complainant’s evidence. He points to two aspects: whether the bedroom door
    was locked in connection with the first assault; and whether the back seat of
    the car was folded down in connection with the second. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge is not required to resolve all inconsistencies in the evidence. She
    described these matters as peripheral details. She accepted the complainant’s
    evidence as to what the appellant did and concluded that this satisfied her
    beyond a reasonable doubt. That conclusion was available to her on the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=LHeading11>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal on conviction is dismissed. The appellant withdrew
    the sentence appeal. </p>
