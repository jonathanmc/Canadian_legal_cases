  <h1><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:
200%'>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>Introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following a jury trial, the appellant was
    convicted of three counts of sexual assault and one count of assault. He was
    sentenced to a total of four years’ imprisonment. He appeals his convictions
    and seeks leave to appeal sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant is the appellant’s former wife. She
    is from a Sikh family; the appellant’s mother is Muslim. The two were married in
    a Muslim ceremony on June 30, 2013. The complainant’s parents did not approve
    of the marriage and did not attend the ceremony. The couple separated on March
    22, 2014 when the appellant asked the complainant to leave their home following
    a confrontation with the complainant’s brother. Shortly thereafter, the
    complainant went to the police and alleged that the appellant sexually
    assaulted her by forcing her to participate in oral sex and intercourse on
    three occasions: December 20, 2013; December 28, 2013; and February 18, 2014.
    In addition, the complainant said the appellant had assaulted her by punching a
    wall and threatening her in January 2014.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the complainant, the couple’s
    relationship deteriorated quickly following their marriage. The appellant was
    abusive and controlling. By September&nbsp;2013, the complainant suspected he
    was having an affair. When the December sexual assaults occurred, their
    relationship was very bad: she was sleeping on a couch that was not in the
    couple’s bedroom. At the time of the February sexual assault, the complainant
    had returned to the bedroom, but the relationship was tense. The appellant came
    home drunk and she did not agree to have sex with him on that occasion. During
    cross-examination, the complainant acknowledged that prior to the February 2014
    incident, she told the appellant she thought she was pregnant and that both were
    happy at the prospect of having a child. However, she testified that the
    appellant became angry a few days later after she told him she realized that
    she was not in fact pregnant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified at trial and denied the
    offences. Although he acknowledged having sexual relations with the complainant
    on the dates in question, he maintained that the complainant consented and that
    the couple was attempting to conceive a child. Much of the tension in the
    marriage was due to the complainant nagging him about infidelity, an accusation
    he denied. The defence theory at trial was that, after the appellant asked her
    to leave the home, the complainant fabricated her allegations out of spite and to
    save face because the marriage had failed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the trial, the trial judge dismissed an
    application by the appellant under s. 276 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> to lead
    evidence that the couple was attempting to have a baby between December 2013
    and February 2014. In a further ruling, the trial judge permitted the Crown to
    lead evidence of other discreditable conduct by the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raised five issues on his
    conviction appeal and, in addition, sought to lead fresh evidence in relation
    to his sentence appeal.</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    argued that the trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to call extensive

    item of discreditable conduct evidence. In our view, itemization of all the
    discreditable conduct evidence would not have enured to the appellant’s benefit
    and the language used by the trial judge was adequate to convey to the jury
    that they could not use any evidence they accepted to jump to a conclusion of

    argued that the trial Crown’s cross-examination of him was improper in several
    respects to the point that it rendered the trial unfair. The appellant says the
    most significant problem was the trial Crown’s repeated suggestions that the
    appellant was lying or attempting to mislead the jury. The appellant maintains
    that many of these suggestions were not a fair reflection of his evidence.
    Further, as much of the cross-examination focused on the other discreditable
    conduct evidence with extensive questioning devoted to, for example, the
    appellant’s alleged infidelity and the threatening comment to the complainant’s
    brother, these suggestions that the appellant was lying to the jury fed into
    that evidence and heightened the prejudice occasioned by it. In oral
    submissions, the appellant identified several occasions on which he submits the
    trial Crown made unfair suggestions that he was lying or attempting to mislead
    the jury. </span></p>

    than one occasion, the Crown made suggestions that were either not founded in
    the evidence or constituted a misstatement of the evidence and that this
    contributed to the overall unfairness of the cross-examination. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not accept these submissions. While we
    agree that the trial Crown misstated the evidence on occasion when putting
    suggestions to the appellant and that it might have been preferable had he
    refrained from use of the word “lying”, overall we are not persuaded that the
    appellant’s cross-examination was such as to prejudice the appellant in his defence
    or bring the administration of justice into disrepute. </span></p>

    of misstatements of the evidence and objected appropriately on several
    occasions when this occurred. Apart from that objection, defence counsel made no
    objection to the tenor of the cross-examination – appropriately so in our view,
    as he had suggested to the complainant on several occasions that she was lying.
    In closing submissions, defence counsel submitted to the jury that the
    complainant was a liar. Particularly in the context of a hard fought trial
    where the credibility of both the complainant and the appellant were central
    issues, the Crown was entitled to mount a vigorous challenge to the appellant’s
    evidence. Ultimately, it was for the jury to assess whether the suggestions
    made by defence counsel and the trial Crown were accurate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    consider whether more judicious language and a more measured approach would
    better serve the overall administration of justice. Credibility problems can
    often be better illustrated through a more subtle approach than the explicit
    suggestion that a witness is lying. Moreover, the latter approach can easily
    backfire if perceived by the trier of fact as inaccurate, unfair or frivolous. Here,
    the trial Crown’s cross-examination of the appellant about the patently

    claimed relevance of the evidence as providing the background of events gave
    rise to the potential for the prohibited reasoning that because the complainant
    consented to sexual activity on other occasions it was more likely that she
    consented in relation to the alleged offences. The trial judge noted that under
    s. 276(2)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, she was required to consider a
    number of factors and engage in a balancing exercise to determine whether the
    proposed evidence had significant probative value not substantially outweighed
    by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.  Although
    she found the proposed evidence could have some relevance to evaluating the
    complainant’s evidence, she concluded that even with an instruction to the

    C.C.C. (3d) 71, the appellant submits that trial judge erred in finding his

    requirements of s. 276. Further, he argues that the trial judge erred in
    failing to recognize the value of the proposed evidence to credibility issues
    in that it would have supported the appellant's version of events and
    demonstrated that, as late as February 2014, the complainant was happy to
    become pregnant with the appellant. Finally, the appellant submits that given
    the trial judge's ruling allowing discreditable conduct evidence to be

    appellant’s proposed evidence lacked the specificity necessary to support its
    admission, we see no error in the trial judge’s ruling. Apart from giving rise
    to the prohibited inference that because she consented to sexual relations on
    other occasions, the complainant was more likely to have consented on the dates
    of the alleged offences, the proposed evidence had limited value to assessing
    the complainant’s overall credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant gave specific evidence about the
    state of the parties’ relationship at the time of the alleged offences and of
    the manner in which she alleged the offences occurred. Evidence that the
    complainant consented to having sexual relations on other unspecified dates because
    she wanted to try to conceive a child with the appellant was of minimal value
    in assessing the complainant’s evidence about the state of the relationship at
    particular times or whether she consented to sexual relations on the dates of
    the alleged offences. We note that, in any event, defence counsel at trial was
    permitted to ask the complainant about her emotional state, and the
    appellant’s, during the period when she thought she was pregnant. She agreed
    they were happy. However, as we will explain the predicted problem arose: in
    his closing address to the jury, defence counsel at trial attempted to use this
    evidence to invite prohibited twin myths reasoning.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, we reject the submission that in light
    of the trial judge’s ruling permitting the Crown to lead other discreditable
    conduct evidence, this ruling permitted the Crown to present a skewed picture
    of the events. As we have said, defence counsel was permitted to elicit
    evidence that the complainant was happy when she believed she was pregnant and
    the appellant testified that the couple was attempting to conceive at the time
    of the alleged offences. In any event, in the absence of evidence of specific
    discussions or attempts to get pregnant with specific probative value in
    relation to a particular allegation, general evidence that the complainant was
    prepared, and even happy, to conceive a child with the appellant had little
    probative value in relation to either the alleged offences or as a response to

lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the complainant’s evidence concerning the
    sexual assaults, her relationship with the complainant was poor at the time of
    all of the alleged offences to the point she was sleeping on the couch as of
    December 20 and 28, 2013. The complainant testified that: she did not verbally
    agree to engage in sexual activity at the time of any of the alleged offences;
    she expressly said no on both December 28, 2013 and February 18, 2013; the
    appellant physically manoeuvered her body to force her to engage in sexual
    activity on all three occasions and she tried to resist on both December 20,
    2013 and February 18, 2013. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant acknowledged the complainant was
    sleeping on the couch as of December 20 and 28, 2014. According to the
    appellant, he and the complainant were attempting to have a child on each of
    the three dates; they had specific discussions to that effect sometime before
    engaging in sexual activity on December 20, 2013 and immediately prior on
    February 18, 2014. Further, he claimed that although the complainant initially
    declined his invitation to come upstairs to their bedroom on December 28, 2013,
    she later came upstairs, which led to the couple engaging in sexual activity.
    The appellant asserted that the complainant never gave any physical or verbal
    indication that she was not consenting to sexual activity on any of the three
    occasions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, neither the complainant’s nor the
    appellant’s evidence creates an air of reality for a defence of honest but
    mistaken belief in communicated consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant’s evidence was that she did not
    consent to sexual activity on the dates of the alleged offences and further
    that, on all three occasions, she either said no or tried to resist. The
    essence of the appellant’s evidence was that the appellant consented to sexual
    activity on all three occasions. However, in general, an accused’s evidence
    that the complainant verbally expressed consent to engage in sexual activity
    and never withdrew that consent – as the appellant asserts here in relation to
    the December 20, 2013 and February 18, 2013 incidents – does not give rise to a
    defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. Rather it goes to the issue
    of consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, apart from his evidence that he
    and the complainant specifically discussed attempting to conceive on December
    20, 2013 and February 2014 (which goes to the issue of consent), the appellant
    gave no evidence of reasonable steps to ascertain if she was consenting on
    those occasions or on December 28, 2013. Concerning the December 28, 2013
    incident, the complainant testified that after declining the appellant’s
    invitation to join him upstairs, she went upstairs to go to the bathroom. She
    also said she resisted. The appellant’s testimony that the complainant never
    gave any verbal or physical indication of lack of consent, standing alone,
    could not give rise to a defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated
    consent, as that claim would be based on a mistake of law: <em>R. v. Barton</em>,
    2019 SCC 33, 435 DLR (4th) 191, at para. 107.</span></p>

    lack of objection cannot create an air of reality for a defence that is not

    or have a relationship with anyone and that she suffers back problems because
    of prolonged sleeping on the couch. </span></p>

    sworn by a legal assistant to appellant’s counsel based on information received
    from appellant’s counsel. Attached as exhibits to the affidavit were what the
    affiant described as screenshots from the complainant’s Facebook page, her
    Instagram page and the Facebook page of the complainant’s new spouse. These
    screenshots purported to disclose, among other things, that the complainant and
    her new spouse became engaged prior to the date of the complainant’s victim

    the affiant did not disclose any of the following information: i) from whom
    counsel received advice about the complainant’s Facebook profile name; ii) any
    basis on which the affiant or counsel confirmed the profile photographs were in
    fact photographs of the complainant; iii)&nbsp;who took the screenshots; iv)
    when and on what device the screenshots were taken; iv) whether the screenshots

    However, the offences for which he was sentenced were extremely serious. They
    consisted of three serious sexual assaults, all involving oral sex and
    intercourse, committed in the context of a domestic relationship. Such offences
    demand a significant penitentiary sentence to properly reflect proportionality
    as well as the principles of denunciation and both general and specific
    deterrence. A four-year penitentiary sentence was entirely fit in the
