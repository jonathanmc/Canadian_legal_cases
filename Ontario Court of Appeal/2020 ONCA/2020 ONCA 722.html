  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal primarily focuses on the issue of
    notice of a significant increase in restrictions on the liberty of an NCR (not
    criminally responsible on account of mental disorder) accused and the resultant
    mandatory hearing under ss. 672.56(2) and 672.81(2.1), respectively, of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-US>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-US>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46
    (the “<em>Code</em>”),</span><span lang=EN-US> and the application of the
    framework established by this court in </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Campbell&nbsp;(Re)</span></em><span
lang=EN-US>, 2018 ONCA 140, 139 O.R. (3d) 401. The appellant, Van Truong Tran,
    submits that notice and a restriction of liberty hearing were required and that
    the increased restrictions on his liberty were not the least onerous and least
    restrictive in the circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Tran also asks that the Ontario Review Board’s
    (the “Board’s”) continued detention disposition be replaced by a conditional discharge
    disposition.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lastly, as part of this appeal and the companion
    appeal in <em>Brownlee (Re)</em>, 2020 ONCA 723, the Attorney General of
    Ontario invites this court to endorse its proposed procedures on notices and
    hearings under ss. 672.56(2) and 672.81(2.1) of the <em>Code</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, we would dismiss
    the appeal. We would also decline to endorse the Attorney General’s proposed
    notice and hearing procedure.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Background Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Tran had been found NCR on charges of
    attempted murder, assault with a weapon, endangering life while committing an
    assault, aggravated assault, uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm,
    and possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose. The index offences occurred
    in April 2014. He had stabbed the victim in his right side before stabbing him
    again in the back. Two days later, he contacted the victim, stating “this time,
    it was with a knife” but the next time “it could be worse.” He has been diagnosed
    with schizophrenia and substance use disorder (which is in remission in a
    controlled setting) and has differential diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder
    and major depressive disorder.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>He is 49 years old, and prior to the index
    offences, he had no known psychiatric history or hospitalizations. He was
    initially under the jurisdiction of the Quebec Review Board and subsequently
    was transferred to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (“CAMH”) in March
    2016. He started on the secure forensic unit and then was moved to the general
    forensic unit in November 2016.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In February 2017, he began using accompanied
    hospital grounds privileges. This meant he could leave the ward with one staff
    person and other patients. This expanded to use of accompanied privileges to
    the community in April 2017.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By October 2017, he was exercising indirectly
    supervised privileges on hospital grounds, and by January 2018, to the
    community. This meant he could leave the grounds alone.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On June 4, 2018, he was subject to a disposition
    detaining him on a general forensic unit with privileges up to and including
    community living in approved accommodations with conditions. He continued to
    reside on the general forensic unit, under the care of Dr. Benassi. In the
    hospital report filed as evidence before the Board, CAMH reported that there
    were no incidents of violence, physical aggression, absconding, or other
    problematic behaviour. He attended Hong Fook Asian Mental Health Association’s
    English classes (“ESL classes”) twice a week in the community, which were
    operated by the Toronto District School Board. His team arranged for a
    Vietnamese-speaking volunteer to visit Mr. Tran and assist in practicing his
    English. The hospital further reported that with encouragement from the
    recreational therapist, Mr. Tran participated in some recreational programming,
    including a cooking group, gym, and a summer outdoor soccer league. Feedback
    from program facilitators was positive.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Other than his partner, who visited once or
    twice a month at the hospital, Mr.&nbsp;Tran did not identify any other
    personal supports. The hospital reported that he was not observed to often
    socially engage with others and tended to keep to himself in the hospital and
    in the community. The clinical team applied to a variety of community
    accommodations, and Mr. Tran was designated Alternative Level of Care, a
    hospital designation that signifies readiness for discharge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January 2019, Mr. Tran asked to switch to a
    new antipsychotic medication due to potential weight gain side-effects. The
    hospital changed his medication.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On April 10, 2019, the Board convened for Mr.
    Tran’s 2019 annual disposition review, but it was adjourned to June 12, 2019
    due to the absence of the Vietnamese interpreter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After April 10, 2019, his clinical team saw a
    change in his mental state and noticed behavioural changes indicating possible
    mental deterioration. In its report, the hospital stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>On several occasions [Mr. Tran] was observed
    to be talking to himself out loud in Vietnamese which was out of character for
    him. When questioned about this, he claimed he was either [singing] out loud or
    telling others (who were not Vietnamese-speaking) “jokes.” His affect remained
    euthymic, yet he became more socially withdrawn and suddenly stopped
    participating in hospital and community programming. It was discovered that he
    missed several Hong Fook ESL classes as he stopped attending. When questioned
    by the team, he claimed he was suffering from a “headache” [and] could no
    longer concentrate and participate in programs or activities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As of April 10, 2019, he had voluntarily ceased
    attending all of his community programs but was using indirectly supervised
    passes daily to go on hospital grounds and to go to the store in the community
    across the street from the hospital.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Then, on April 30, 2019, Mr. Tran disclosed at
    his team review that he had been experiencing delusions and auditory
    hallucinations, and that they had been present during his entire admission to
    CAMH. He reported hearing voices that, among other things, would threaten to
    kill him. Dr. Benassi comprehensively assessed Mr. Tran, who no longer believed
    that he suffered from a mental condition and did not believe psychotic
    treatment was necessary to manage his mental condition or that there would be
    any consequence if discontinued. Dr.&nbsp;Benassi opined that Mr. Tran was no
    longer capable of consenting to psychiatric treatment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On April 30, 2019, Mr. Tran’s team placed on
    hold his access to the community and his indirectly supervised privileges both
    on the hospital grounds and in the community. He did not lose his accompanied
    privileges to the hospital grounds but declined to use them. He did not want to
    go out with staff members.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 28, 2019, Mr. Tran regained his access to
    escorted community passes, but again did not want to go out with staff members.
    On June 7, 2019, he was restarted on his former medication. Dr. Benassi
    testified that within two to three weeks the hospital might be in a position to
    restore the passes.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>CAMH Letter to the Board</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 27, 2019, CAMH wrote to the Board, with a
    copy to the Crown and Mr. Tran’s counsel, for “informational purposes only”
    pursuant to para. 69 of this court’s decision in <em>Campbell</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Darby, the Person in Charge at CAMH,
    commenced CAMH’s letter with reference to <em>Campbell</em>. He advised that as
    of April 30, 2019, Mr. Tran’s indirectly supervised off-unit privileges were
    placed on hold:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>due to a significant deterioration in his
    mental state, including auditory hallucinations and paranoid beliefs. Mr. Tran
    has disclosed that he has been hearing voices making derogatory comments and
    threatening to kill him. At times, the auditory hallucinations scare Mr. Tran,
    who also believes he has a camera in his eye controlled remotely by people via
    the Internet and has disclosed delusional thoughts with respect to people
    spying on him. Mr. Tran has had at least two episodes of non-compliance with
    his oral anti-psychotic medication during this period of psychotic relapse.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Darby explained that Mr. Tran’s indirectly
    supervised passes were on hold given concerns about his risk to others if
    unsupervised while off the unit. Mr.&nbsp;Tran continued to have access to
    staff-accompanied passes off the unit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Darby added that when Mr. Tran’s passes were
    placed on hold, Mr.&nbsp;Tran’s “liberty norm” could be characterized as the
    exercising of indirectly supervised passes into the community and on hospital
    grounds. Referencing <em>Campbell</em>, Dr. Darby acknowledged that the
    restriction from April 30 to the date of the letter, May 27, 2019, <a
name="_Hlk55401726">clearly deviated from Mr. Tran’s established “liberty norm”</a>.
    However, applying the test from <em>Campbell</em>, CAMH took the position that
    “a reasonable person aware of the circumstances of Mr. Tran’s case <u>would not</u> believe that the hospital’s decision to place his indirectly supervised passes
    on hold resulted in a loss of liberty so significant that the Board must
    convene a hearing” (emphasis in original). Dr. Darby concluded his letter by
    stating that the hospital’s actions were the least onerous and restrictive way
    of managing the risk, the letter was not a notification under s. 672.56(2) of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-US>Code</span></em><span lang=EN-US> of a
    significant restriction of liberty, and Mr. Tran’s annual review was scheduled
    for June 12, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 28, 2019, Mr. Tran’s counsel wrote to the
    Board asking it to convene a hearing to review the allegedly significant
    increase on the restriction of his liberty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 29, 2019, the Board responded to Dr.
    Darby at CAMH with a copy to Mr. Tran’s counsel, stating that his letter would
    be distributed at Mr. Tran’s annual hearing on June 12, 2019. It did not write
    separately to Mr. Tran’s counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>The Hearing and the Board’s Decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Board convened on June 12, 2019. It addressed
    the necessary and appropriate disposition. As well, the Board considered Mr. Tran’s
    loss of privileges and asked the parties to provide written submissions on this
    issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    threat to the safety of the public, Mr. Tran focused his challenge of the
    disposition on the Board’s rejection of his submission that he should be
    discharged pursuant to certain conditions. Mr. Tran had consented to submit to
    a treatment clause and to the Person in Charge determining his residence and
    agreed to remain at CAMH until appropriate accommodation could be found for

    circumstances included Mr. Tran’s significant psychiatric history, the index
    offences, and his recent decompensation following a change in his medication.
    In consequence, the Board concluded that although Mr. Tran was initially
    designated as ready for discharge, that plan had to be altered because of the
    dramatic change in his condition. As a result of this change, his risk to the
    public could not be adequately safeguarded by a conditional discharge
    disposition. A detention order allowing CAMH staff to stabilize Mr. Tran’s
    psychotic symptoms and medication, approve his housing, and determine his level
    of privileges in the community was required to manage his significant risk to
    the safety of the public, with the hope that Mr. Tran would again be ready for

    Board’s conclusion that Mr. Tran represents a significant risk to public
    safety. Mr. Tran’s index offences were very serious: under the influence of his
    psychosis, he heard voices telling him to kill people, which led to him
    stabbing an acquaintance with a knife. While Mr. Tran has made significant
    progress over the last few years and was ready for discharge, unfortunately,
    following a change in his medication, he again began to exhibit psychotic
    symptoms and heard the same kind of voices that had led to the index offence,
    though Mr. Tran submits these voices do not instruct him to commit violence
    against others. He lost insight into his mental illness and need for medication,

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, when determining the NCR
    accused’s liberty norm, hospitals should take a contextual approach, one that

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>Once the liberty norm is determined, it must
    be compared against the NCR accused’s liberty status following the increases in

    liberty status must be so significant that a reasonable person, considering all
    of the circumstances, would think that the Board should be called on to
    consider whether the hospital properly applied the least onerous and least
    restrictive test ahead of the next annual review.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Put another way, <em>Campbell</em><i> </i>asks:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>1. Was there an increase in the restrictions on the accused’s
    liberty, having regard to:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) the accused’s liberty norm before the impugned restriction;</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(b) the accused’s liberty status following the impugned
    restriction; and</p>
  <p class=CQuote>2. If yes, is the “change in liberty status … so significant
    that a reasonable person, considering all of the circumstances, would think
    that the Board should be called on to consider whether the hospital properly
    applied the least onerous and least restrictive test ahead of the next annual
    review”: at para. 67.</p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-US>Thus, <em>Campbell</em><i> </i>contemplates
    first a finding on whether there was in fact an increase in restrictions. In <em>Campbell</em> itself, the majority of the Board had concluded that the transfer of Ms.
    Campbell from the secure forensic rehabilitation unit (“FRU”) to the secure forensic
    assessment unit (“FAU”) “actually resulted in a less restrictive environment”
    because at the FAU, she no longer needed one-on-one supervision: <em>Campbell</em>,<i> </i>at para. 18. Once an increase has been established, then the question is
    whether the increase is significant such that notice and a mandatory hearing
    are required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-US>Campbell</span></em><span lang=EN-US> does
    not mandate an inflexible mathematical before and after approach to an NCR
    accused’s liberty norm. The “increase” component of s.&nbsp;672.56(2), or part
    one of the test, requires a quantitative assessment, comparing the before and
    after of the accused’s liberty status. However, part two then involves
    assessment of the reasonableness or significance threshold. In this second part
    of the test, a contextual approach is to be adopted. This flows from Fairburn
    J.A.’s direction that the assessment of the significance of the increase should
    be contextual and individualized (<em>Campbell</em>,<i> </i>at paras. 65, 68)
    and conducted from the perspective of “a reasonable person, <u>considering all
    of the circumstances</u>”: <em>Campbell</em>,<i> </i>at para. 67 (emphasis
    added). This may include consideration of such factors as an accused’s history
    and use of privileges. Examination of what an accused has experienced in the
    recent past involves consideration of the use of privileges by the individual.
    It would also include an accused’s treatment horizon and the proximity of the
    annual review. This evaluation engages the “significant” component of s.
    672.56(2).</span></p>

    longer could attend the hospital grounds or community indirectly supervised and
    for one month his escorted passes to the community were withheld. Indeed, in
    its <em>Campbell</em> letter to the Board, the hospital acknowledged an
    increase in the restrictions on Mr. Tran’s liberty. In making the restriction
    of liberty determination, the Board conflated the two parts of the test. The
    Board looked at both Mr. Tran’s liberty history and his more recent experience
    and concluded that his liberty norm was in a state of flux and in the process
    of deteriorating. Thus, it examined use of privileges in its analysis of Mr.
    Tran’s liberty norm rather than as a factor to be considered in its significance
    analysis. This conflation amounted to an error of law.</span></p>

    was altered, whose mental state then seriously deteriorated, and who had reduced
    his own use of his privileges. He had stopped engaging in the indirectly
    supervised activities he used to enjoy, instead preferring to remain close to
    the hospital. While he could no longer exercise indirectly supervised passes,
    he continued to have access to accompanied passes to the hospital grounds, and

    that Mr. Tran was “only” participating in these activities, the Board did not
    engage in a qualitative evaluation of their worth. Rather, the use of the word
    “only” refers to the narrowness of Mr. Tran’s self-restricted activities, which
    the Board was entitled to take into account.</span></p>

    the hospital must be left to do its work “free from constant review and all of the

    impose.” Absent a significant increase in the restriction of liberty, the
    day-to-day management decisions are to be left with the hospital until the next
    annual review. The significance inquiry must be informed by the discretion
    afforded to the hospital. To require notice and a hearing in the circumstances

    visit a store across the street from the hospital and to access the hospital

    reducing” his use of privileges and that his use was in a state of flux and in

    the Board. It reported that prior to April 10, 2019, Mr. Tran had attended ESL
    classes twice a week and recreational programming including a cooking group,
    gym and a summer outdoor soccer league. The hospital reported that shortly
    after April 10, 2019, he had stopped participating in hospital and community
    programming including his ESL classes. He had become socially withdrawn. By
    April 30, 2019, when his privileges were placed on hold, he had not been attending
    ESL classes or any of the other community programs for close to three weeks.
