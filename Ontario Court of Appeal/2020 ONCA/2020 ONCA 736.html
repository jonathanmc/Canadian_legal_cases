lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal has a long history. The appellant
    was convicted in March 2016 and sentenced to three years in the penitentiary in
    October 2016. He was released on bail pending appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>His appeal was eventually scheduled for argument
    in June 2019. Shortly before the scheduled appeal date, counsel for the
    appellant sought an adjournment to allow counsel to pursue a potential fresh
    evidence application based on the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel.
    I directed the appeal should proceed as scheduled, and counsel could, if necessary,
    renew his request for an adjournment after the grounds of appeal arising from
    the trial record had been argued. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the appellant argued the grounds of
    appeal arising out of the trial record at the hearing in June 2019. After oral
    argument, the court indicated none of the grounds advanced by the appellant
    could succeed. Counsel renewed his request to adjourn the appeal so he could
    investigate and, if appropriate, pursue an allegation of ineffective
    assistance. The court granted the adjournment, anticipating it would be
    relatively brief.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel decided to pursue the ineffective
    assistance of counsel claim and a schedule was set for the filing of affidavits
    and cross-examination on those affidavits. Counsel were not available to argue
    the appeal until the spring of 2020. By then, the pandemic had arrived and a
    further adjournment was granted. The appeal was ultimately adjourned to October
    29, 2020. </span></p>

    court heard from both counsel on the ineffective assistance claim. The court
    rejected that claim, and dismissed the appellant’s appeals from conviction and
    sentence with reasons to follow. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These reasons will first consider the conviction
    appeal, beginning with the grounds based on the trial record, followed by the

    There were significant inconsistencies in her evidence. M.A.’s evidence also
    differed in material respects from her statement to the police and her
    preliminary inquiry testimony. Most notably, M.A. never alleged sexual
    intercourse occurred until she testified at trial. There was no mention of that
    allegation in her statement to the police or her preliminary inquiry testimony.
    The jury acquitted on the charge alleging sexual intercourse.</span></p>

    contained various inconsistencies and variations from earlier statements. One
    of M.A.’s friends also acknowledged at least some her evidence was based on
    information she received from other people. The two friends did, however, provide
    confirmatory evidence of sexual activity between the appellant and M.A. </span></p>

    appellant in the fall of 2013, a few months after the alleged assaults. T.W. heard
    rumours the appellant and M.A. had sex. She looked through the appellant’s
    phone and found messages, which appeared to be between the appellant and M.A.
    In the messages, the appellant asked M.A. if “she liked it”, and if she wanted
    “to do it again”. T.W. confronted the appellant with these messages and he
    denied they existed. When T.W. told him she had seen the messages, he changed
    his story and said the comments related to sexually explicit text messages
    between M.A. and  him. </span></p>

    matter of law, consent to the sexual activity: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s.
    150.1(1). At trial, the defence sought to advance two positions. First, the
    defence argued the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the
    alleged sexual activity had occurred. Second, the defence maintained if the sexual
    activity occurred, the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the
    appellant did not believe M.A. was 16 or older and had failed to prove the
    appellant did not take “all reasonable steps to ascertain” M.A.’s age: <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, s. 150.1(4). </span></p>

    defence in s. 150.1(4) could succeed only if a jury had a reasonable doubt as
    to whether the appellant believed M.A. was 16 or older (the subjective component),
    and had a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant had taken all reasonable
    steps to ascertain M.A.’s age (the objective component). Consequently, if there
    was no air of reality to either the subjective or objective component of the
    defence, the defence could not be left with the jury: see <em>R. v. Cinous</em>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In support of the submission the appellant’s
    mistaken belief in M.A.’s age should have been left as a defence, counsel
    referred to M.A.’s Facebook profile, which indicated she was 18 years old. Counsel
    also referred to evidence of M.A.’s conduct during the night of the alleged
    assaults. He argued her conduct, while with the appellant, could lend an air of
    reality to the contention the appellant believed M.A. was 16 or older. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no direct evidence the appellant ever
    saw M.A.’s Facebook profile. The trial judge referred to the suggestion he had
    as “mere speculation.” The appellant did, however, communicate for several
    months, and on many occasions, with M.A. using Facebook. Her profile was
    readily available to anyone communicating with her. On this evidence, it is a fair
    inference the appellant probably saw the Facebook profile at some point during his
    interaction with M.A. on Facebook. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The probability the appellant saw M.A.’s Facebook
    profile at some time in the months before they actually met does not, however,
    standing alone, provide a basis upon which a jury could have a doubt about the appellant’s
    belief with respect to M.A.’s age at the relevant time. Facebook profiles are not
    inherently accurate or reliable. Nor does seeing a Facebook profile mean one
    has read the profile. A reference in the profile to a date of birth, if
    remembered at all, would have little, if any, significance to the appellant’s
    belief about M.A.’s age after he had actually met her and spent hours with her.
    The crucial question insofar as the availability of the defence is concerned is
    what the appellant believed about M.A.’s age when he engaged in sexual activity
    with her, not what he saw on her Facebook profile, weeks or months earlier. The
    Facebook profile, on its own, is not enough to lend an air of reality to a
    defence predicated on the appellant’s belief M.A. was 16 or older.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>M.A.’s conduct, while with the appellant on the
    night of the assaults, also provides no air of reality to the assertion the
    appellant honestly believed M.A. was at least 16. This part of the inquiry is
    purely subjective. The trier of fact looks for evidence of what the appellant
    actually believed. While it is a fair generalization most persons who engage in
    certain kinds of activity are 16 or older, that generalization provides no
    insight into what the appellant believed about M.A.’s age at the relevant time.
    In other words, accepting that most people who engage in a certain sexual activity
    are over 16 does not assist in determining what the appellant believed about M.A.’s
    age based on her conduct. Furthermore, as the trial judge pointed out, to the
    extent the appellant relied on the sexual nature of some of M.A.’s alleged conduct
    as a basis for any belief about her age, that belief could not assist the
    appellant if it was formed during or after the activity constituting the sexual
    assault. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I accept the trial judge’s holding there was
    no air of reality to the appellant’s claim he honestly believed M.A. was at
    least 16, it is unnecessary to deal with the trial judge’s further conclusion
    there was no air of reality to the objective component of the mistaken belief
    in consent defence. I will, however, address the objective component. I agree
    with the trial judge’s assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no evidence the appellant took any positive
    steps to determine M.A.’s age. He submitted positive steps are not always
    necessary to satisfy the reasonable steps component in s. 150.1(4). As
    indicated in <em>R. v. Duran</em>, 2013 ONCA 343, at para. 52:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Indeed, in some cases, an accused’s visual

    determine M.A.’s age were a prerequisite to the availability of the defence.
    She did, however, correctly observe the appellant took none. In effect, the
    trial judge found there was no air of reality to the assertion “visual
    observations of the complainant” could, in the circumstances in which the
    appellant found himself, amount to “all reasonable steps” to determine M.A.’s
    age. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This finding is unassailable. It will be a very
    unusual case when simply looking at a complainant will provide a basis for a
    defence under s. 150.1(4). The facts of this case are a long way from that rare
    case. M.A. was 12 years old. There is very little evidence about her appearance
    on the night of the alleged assaults, and certainly nothing to suggest merely
    observing her was all that was needed to meet the “all reasonable steps”
    requirement in s. 150.1(4). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In holding that the trial judge correctly
    concluded there was no air of reality to the objective component of the
    mistaken belief in age defence, I do not suggest it is for the trial judge to
    decide what did or did not constitute all reasonable steps. That is a jury
    question. The trial judge had to determine whether the evidence gave an air of
    reality to the assertion the jury could be left with a doubt as to whether an
    accused took all reasonable steps to determine a complainant’s age. </span></p>

    the screenshot was accurate, and the jury believed that evidence, M.A.’s

    counsel identified several aspects of M.A.’s testimony he believed made her

    accused whether to testify. Counsel must ensure the accused understands it is
    the accused who must make that decision: <em>R. v. Stark</em>, at para. 17.
    Counsel must, however, arm the accused with the information needed to make an
    informed decision. That information includes counsel’s advice about testifying
    and the reasons behind that advice.</span></p>

    made. Hindsight has no role to play. Advice and representation that were
    reasonable when provided cannot be made unreasonable by virtue of an adverse
    verdict: <em>R. v. Archer</em>, at para. 119; <em>R. v. Fraser</em>, 2011 NSCA
    70, at paras. 53, 80. As stated by Major J., in <em>R. v. G.G.B.</em>, 2000 SCC

    does not require counsel say or do everything that may have been appropriate or
    helpful to the accused in deciding whether to testify. When an ineffective
    assistance claim is predicated entirely on counsel’s failure to discuss a specific
    piece of evidence in the context of providing advice about testifying, the
    argument can only succeed if that single piece of evidence was, on any
    reasonable view, so important to the decision to testify that counsel’s failure
    to discuss it pushed counsel’s performance below the reasonable professional
    assistance standard. </span></p>

    through the eyes of a reasonable person placed in counsel’s circumstances, and
    bearing in mind that the reasonableness standard describes a range of conduct. The
    importance of that evidence cannot be judged from the post-verdict vantage
    point of a convicted accused. It is hardly surprising an accused who took
    counsel’s advice, but now finds himself convicted and facing a jail sentence, has
    come to see the missing piece of information as crucial to proper

    the day of trial”. Counsel believed he had exposed T.M.’s efforts to lie to the

    be “a strong witness”. He was young, inexperienced in the trial process, and

    in the evidence of the Crown’s witness, stressing “the fact that everybody’s  story
    kept changing”. In reference to T.M.’s evidence, trial counsel spoke of the
    differences between her statements, her testimony at the preliminary inquiry,

    advice was rendered  ineffective by what was not said. Certainly, counsel could
    have explained the evidentiary status of the screenshot when advising the
    appellant whether he should testify. No doubt, there were other aspects of the
    evidence counsel could have discussed with the appellant as well. </span></p>

    in the abstract, but must be measured, having regard to the dynamic of the specific
    trial. Trial counsel had concluded the Crown witnesses were not credible and
    their evidence could not successfully carry the burden of proof. In counsel’s
    view, the best defence lay in the assertion the Crown had failed to prove its
    case because the Crown witnesses, especially M.A., were not credible. Not
    surprisingly, given counsel’s assessment of the evidence, his discussions with
    the appellant about testifying focused on the harm done to the Crown’s case in
    cross-examination and the dangers inherent in testifying. </span></p>

    the appellant the full benefit of his advice, including an explanation of his
    reasons for that advice. In my view, counsel met those obligations in his
    discussions with the appellant. The appellant made an informed decision not to
    testify. </span></p>

    of the evidence and identify the pros and cons of testifying and not testifying
    associated with each piece of evidence. Nor was counsel obliged to provide
    advice based on a hypothetical assessment of the evidence that conflicted with counsel’s
    actual assessment. Counsel had fully explained to the appellant why he did not
    think the appellant should testify. The explanation included counsel’s
    assessment of the credibility of the Crown witnesses and the risks inherent in
    the appellant testifying. The reasonable professional assistance standard did
    not require trial counsel to go on and explain to the appellant how M.A.’s
    credibility, which trial counsel believed was badly damaged on
    cross-examination, could be further damaged were the appellant to act against
    his advice and take the very real risk of testifying so he could give evidence about
    the screenshot in the hope the jury would believe that evidence and have yet
    another reason to disbelieve M.A. I have difficulty seeing how that kind of

    accused put telephone records to the complainant showing some 900 calls between
    the complainant and the accused, half of which were initiated by the
    complainant. The complainant denied the authenticity of the records. Even

    assistance. Those records could have been used, not only to impeach the

    demonstrate counsel’s failure to refer to the screenshot when discussing whether
    the appellant should testify had a negative impact on the reliability of the
    verdict. To do so, the appellant must demonstrate there is a reasonable
    prospect he would have testified, had he been told his evidence was necessary
    to authenticate the screenshot.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant insisted he would have testified even
    if trial counsel advised him not to testify, had he understood his evidence was
    necessary to authenticate the screenshot. The appellant asserted, wrongly, the
    authentication of the screenshot could “prove his innocence”. As explained
    above, the screenshot could only be used to impeach the complainant’s
    credibility, assuming the jury believed the appellant’s unconfirmed evidence
    about the authenticity of the screenshot. The risks the appellant would take in
    testifying, as described to him by trial counsel, all applied to his evidence
    about the screenshot. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>More to the point, I do not accept the
    appellant’s assertion he would have insisted on testifying. Had the appellant
    and trial counsel discussed the screenshot, nothing in that discussion would
    have altered trial counsel’s assessment about the weaknesses in the Crown’s
    case, the real risks inherent in the appellant testifying, and the tactical
    advantage in going last to the jury. Counsel’s advice would not have changed
    and there is no reason to think the appellant would not have accepted trial
    counsel’s analysis and advice, even if it included reference to testifying in
    order to authenticate the screenshot. Why would the appellant suddenly reject
    counsel’s assessment about the inadequacies in the Crown’s case and choose to
    run the risk of testifying, solely to potentially undermine T.M.’s credibility,
    when, on the advice of his trusted lawyer, that credibility had already been
    sufficiently damaged?</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant may have come to believe, years
    after his trial, he would have insisted on testifying had he understood the screenshot
    would not otherwise be evidence of its contents. That belief stands between the
    appellant and a significant penitentiary sentence. Viewed from the perspective
    of the trial, I have no doubt had the fulsome discussion about testifying
    included a discussion about the screenshot evidence, the appellant would have followed
    counsel’s advice he should not testify. The trial would have proceeded exactly
    as it did, and the jury would have returned the same verdicts. There was no
    miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant received a three-year sentence. The
    trial judge found that the appellant knew that that M.A. was 12-years old, when
    they were chatting on Facebook, when he went to the club to meet with her, when
    he took her back to his home, and when he engaged in sexual activity with her.
    Whatever may be said about the accuracy of the trial judge’s use of the term
    “grooming”, there was ample evidence the appellant built up a relationship
    through Facebook with a 12-year-old child and, when the opportunity arose, took
    advantage of that relationship to sexually abuse M.A.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA> When c</span>onsidering the availability of the defence created by
    s. 150.1(4), the trial judge relied on the interpretation of that provision in
    this court’s jurisprudence as subsequently confirmed in <em><span lang=EN-CA>R.
    v. George</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>, [2017] 1
    S.C.R. 1021, at para. 8</span></em>. On appeal, counsel did not take issue with
    those principles, but argued the trial judge erred in finding no evidentiary
    basis for the s. 150.1(4) defence. We have addressed this argument in the terms
    in which it was put forward. Nothing said in these reasons should be taken as a
    comment on the jurisprudence post-dating this trial relating to the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>mens rea</span></em> requirement when a complainant’s age is an
    element of the offence, considered apart from the mistaken belief defence in s.
    150.1(4): see <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Morrison</span></em>, 2019 SCC 15, at
    para. 88; <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Carbone</span></em>, 2020 ONCA 34, at paras.
