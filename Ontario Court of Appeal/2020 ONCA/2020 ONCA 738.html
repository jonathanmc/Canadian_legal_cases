  <p class=Onappealfrom><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal from the convictions entered

    2018.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Pardu J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with three counts of
    sexual assault and three counts of sexual interference. The complainant was a
    female relative who was nine or ten years of age at the time of the alleged
    offences. The appellant was arrested on September 20, 2016. On February 5, 2018,
    a jury convicted him on all counts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He appeals from those convictions on the ground
    of ineffective assistance of counsel. He says that trial counsel told him that he
    could not allow him to testify and that, as a lay person, he would not be able
    to withstand cross-examination by a professional cross-examiner, a Crown
    attorney. He says, further, that trial counsel failed to give him advice to
    enable him to make an informed decision about whether to testify. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal. The appellant was not given any meaningful advice about whether to
    testify. Had the advantages and disadvantages of testifying been explained to
    him, he likely would have testified. There is a reasonable possibility that,
    had he testified, the verdict would have been different, and so a miscarriage
    of justice has occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>MATERIAL FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following his arrest, the appellant was brought
    to the courthouse. His wife was distraught and crying in the hallway of the
    courthouse when trial counsel approached her and told her he could help secure
    her husband’s release. She paid trial counsel for the bail hearing and the
    appellant was released from custody.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then retained trial counsel to
    defend him on the charges. On October 2, 2016, trial counsel emailed him a
    retainer letter. The appellant signed and returned the retainer letter by email
    on October 13, 2016. The second paragraph of the letter describes the
    relationship between counsel and client:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship
    between the accused and counsel is one of confidence between the parties. Each
    of the accused and counsel have specific roles on [sic] that relationship. The
    accused decides whether to plead guilty (if in fact the accused is guilty - I
    cannot assist an innocent person to plead guilty) or to proceed to trial, the
    accused decides whether (where available) the trial should be before a jury or
    with a judge alone and the accused decides whether the accused will take the
    stand and testify. Counsel decides trial strategy including what witnesses
    (other than the accused) and what evidence to call and what theory to pursue in
    the defence. The accused and counsel will collaborate in the above matters but
    the ultimate decisions are as set forth above. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Proceedings at trial </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was tried by jury. The complainant
    testified at trial and her police interview was admitted pursuant to s. 715.1
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. She testified that the alleged offences took
    place in the appellant’s home on nights when her brothers were also present,
    and when the appellant’s wife was working. The complainant’s mother, father,
    and one of her brothers also testified, but none of them had witnessed the
    alleged offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel called the appellant’s wife to
    testify. She testified that she never worked a night shift during the relevant
    period, that she had always been present when the complainant spent time at the
    appellant’s home, and that she had never seen her husband, the appellant, touch
    the complainant inappropriately. Under cross-examination, she acknowledged that
    she was not always in the same room as her husband and the complainant, as she
    would come and go from the kitchen.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following a brief whispered exchange between
    trial counsel and the appellant in front of the jury, trial counsel indicated
    that he would call no more evidence. The appellant did not testify. The jury
    found the appellant guilty on all counts. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Consultation with appellate counsel</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following conviction, the appellant approached new
    counsel to prepare an appeal (appellate counsel #1). The appellant advised
    appellate counsel #1, among other things, that his trial counsel had not wanted
    him to testify in his defence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After meeting with the appellant, appellate
    counsel #1 telephoned trial counsel in order to assess the merit of the
    appellant’s claims. He asked trial counsel whether it was true that that the
    appellant had not testified in his own defence, in spite of telling trial
    counsel that he wished to do so. Appellate counsel #1, in his affidavit,
    submitted as fresh evidence in this appeal, describes trial counsel’s response:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[Trial counsel] advised me that he could not
    let the [appellant] testify because he, the [appellant], as a lay person could
    never withstand the cross examination of a professional like the Assistant
    Crown Attorney prosecuting the case. I was bewildered by the response and
    therefore restated his reason for not allowing the [appellant] to testify as
    stated above to be sure this was what he meant. [Trial counsel] confirmed that
    this was in fact his reason for advising the [appellant] not to testify in his
    defence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Appellate counsel #1 then realized that he might
    be involved in an appeal as a witness to these statements by trial counsel, and
    referred the appellant to new counsel for the appeal.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Conflicting evidence about the relationship between the appellant
    and his trial counsel</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this appeal, fresh evidence has been filed by
    both parties on the issue of whether there was ineffective assistance of
    counsel, and whether there was a miscarriage of justice. There are affidavits
    from the appellant, his wife, appellate counsel #1, and trial counsel. Each affiant
    was cross-examined on his or her affidavit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, when cross examined on his
    allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, acknowledged having signed
    the retainer letter, but indicated that, approximately 16 months later when his
    trial occurred, he did not understand that whether to testify was his decision
    to make. The retainer letter was part of the blur of events surrounding his
    arrest and the financial arrangements to retain counsel. The appellant has no
    experience with the courts. He attended high school in Trinidad and worked as a
    courier driver for 25 years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel could not specifically recall

    testify was the appellant’s to make. In cross-examination, he initially stated
    that the fact that it was the appellant’s decision “was discussed in a meeting
    we had very early on”. However, he then stated that he did not specifically recall
    this discussion. He assumed it occurred because it was his normal practice, on
    first meeting with a client, to go through the terms of the retainer agreement

lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The only issue in this appeal is whether a
    miscarriage of justice occurred due to ineffective assistance of counsel. To
    succeed in a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must: (1)
    establish the material facts on a balance of probabilities; (2) demonstrate
    that counsel’s acts or omissions amounted to incompetence; and (3) demonstrate
    that counsel’s ineffective representation caused a miscarriage of justice: <em>R.
    v. Archer</em> (2005), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 119-120; <em>R.
    v. Girn</em>, 2019 ONCA 202,145 O.R. (3d) 420, at para. 91.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the appellant suggests, in this case
    ineffective assistance of counsel can be established by demonstrating that
    trial counsel either made the decision not to call the appellant or failed to
    provide advice to the appellant regarding testifying. If either of these is established,
    the question becomes whether trial counsel’s ineffective assistance resulted in
    a miscarriage of justice. In some cases the advice given may be so deficient as
    to undermine the fairness of the trial and result in a miscarriage of justice,
    however for the purposes of this appeal, I need not decide that issue.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I find that trial counsel gave the impression to
    the appellant that the appellant could not be allowed to testify and, in any
    case, failed to provide advice as to whether to testify. This resulted in a
    miscarriage of justice as, provided meaningful advice, the appellant would
    likely have testified, and there is a reasonable possibility that his testimony
    would have led to a different verdict. </span></p>

style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2000 SCC 22, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para.
    24. Competence is assessed by a “reasonableness standard”, and the analysis
    begins with a “strong presumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide
    range of reasonable professional judgment”: <em>G.D.B.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 27. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Reasonable competent counsel may well have
    different views about whether a particular accused should or should not
    testify. As this court noted in <em>R. v. White</em> (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d)
    225, at p. 247, leave to appeal refused, [1997] S.C.C.A. No. 248:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>An appellate
    court’s review of trial counsel’s performance should be deferential.… [D]eference
    is called for because of the broad spectrum of professional judgment that might
    be considered reasonable. In most cases, even among the most skilled counsel,
    no two lawyers will defend an accused in the same way. Different defence
    counsel will use different trial strategies and tactics, different approaches
    to the examination and cross-examination of witnesses, different styles in
    opening and closing argument, all of them reasonable. The art of advocacy yields
    few, if any, absolute rules. It is a highly individualized art. What proves
    effective for one counsel may be ineffective for another. Most cases,
    therefore, offer defence counsel a wide scope for the exercise of reasonable
    skill and judgment. Appellate judges, many of them advocates in their own
    practices, should not be too quick to conclude that a trial lawyer’s
    performance was deficient because they would have conducted the defence
    differently.</span></p>

    understands. The decision whether to testify is ultimately the client’s, but

    is at stake at this crucial moment in the proceedings. The form and content of
    that review will vary in almost every case. In some cases, a skeletal
    discussion may suffice. In others a more detailed review will be required.
    Sometimes it will be lengthy, at other times it may be quite brief. Counsel
    should document that discussion, by a scribbled note to file if more is not

    left with this impression, even if trial counsel had, in his own mind, not
    intended to foreclose testimony from the appellant. However, my conclusion that
