lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 16, 2013, the police searched two
    condominium units, one in Liberty Village (the Liberty Village condominium),
    and the other in Etobicoke (the Etobicoke condominium). The appellant,
    Hobeika, was connected to both. The appellant, Sanchez, was arrested in the
    Etobicoke condominium at the time of the search. The police also searched
    Hobeikas vehicle, located in the parking lot outside of the Etobicoke
    condominium. Hobeika and another person were in the vehicle when it was stopped
    and searched.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police found an assortment of drugs in both
    condominiums and the vehicle. They also located significant amounts of cash in
    both condominiums. Subsequent police investigation led to the seizure of funds from
    Hobeikas bank accounts and other locations. In total, the police seized about
    $400,000 in cash and bank drafts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Hobeika and Sanchez were charged with four
    counts of possession of controlled substances for the purposes of trafficking.
    Each count referred to a different drug. Hobeikas charges were based on drugs
    seized from both condominiums and the vehicle. Sanchezs charges related only
    to drugs seized from the Etobicoke condominium. Hobeika also faced three counts
    of possession of money he knew to be the proceeds of crime and one count of
    money laundering.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge convicted the appellants on all
    counts. He sentenced Hobeika to 8½ years with 227 days credit for presentence
    custody. He sentenced Sanchez to 4½ years with a small credit for presentence
    custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With one small exception, the trial judge
    ordered the forfeiture of all cash found to have been in Hobeikas possession. The
    trial judge also ordered the forfeiture of the Etobicoke condominium owned by
    Hobeika. He concluded the condominium was offence-related property and
    declined to grant relief from forfeiture. </span></p>

    s. 8 and s. 10(b) of the <em>Charter</em>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Hobeika contends the searches of the Liberty Village condominium and the
    Etobicoke condominium violated his s. 8 rights. He makes the same submission
    with respect to the search of his vehicle. Hobeika further submits the police
    violated his rights under s. 10(b) when they did not facilitate his contact
    with counsel for over four hours after he was arrested and had asserted his right
    to counsel. Hobeika contends the constitutional violations justify the
    exclusion of all, or at least some, of the evidence proffered against Hobeika.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On his conviction appeal, Sanchez submits the
    police infringed his rights under s. 8 of the <em>Charter</em> when they
    entered and searched the Etobicoke condominium. He argues the evidence of the
    drugs found in that search should be excluded under s. 24(2). Without that
    evidence, Sanchez must be acquitted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his factum, Sanchez argued the evidence could
    not reasonably support a finding Sanchez was in possession of the drugs found
    in the Etobicoke condominium. Counsel did not make oral argument in support of
    this submission. I do not propose to address it in these reasons. It is
    sufficient to say the trial judges analysis of the evidence and his findings
    fully support his conclusion Sanchez was in possession of some, but not
    necessarily all, of the drugs found in the Etobicoke condominium: see <em>R. v.
    Hobeika</em>, 2017 ONSC 6475, at paras. 44-48.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants s. 8 arguments focus mainly on
    the warrantless entry and search of the Etobicoke condominium. They do,
    however, raise other s. 8 arguments. A somewhat detailed review of the evidence
    is necessary to understand those arguments. My summary borrows heavily from the
    trial judges reasons on the <em>Charter</em> application: 2017 ONSC 6066 (<em>Charter</em> Reasons)</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In early September 2013, a confidential informant
    (CI) advised the police Hobeika was selling various drugs out of his car and
    the Liberty Village condominium, where he lived. The CI had purchased drugs
    from Hobeika at that location. The CI was well known to the police and had
    provided reliable information in the past. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 13, 2013, after investigating and
    confirming some of the information provided by the CI, the police obtained
    search warrants for the Liberty Village condominium and Hobeikas vehicle. Armed
    with the warrants, the police set up surveillance at the Liberty Village
    condominium, hoping to execute both warrants when Hobeika was in the
    condominium. He did not appear and the police obtained an extension of the warrants
    to September 15, 2013.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 15, 2013, the police again set up
    surveillance at the Liberty Village condominium. The police had information the
    vehicle owned by Hobeika was registered to a unit in the Etobicoke condominium.
    Officers were sent to that location to try to locate Hobeikas vehicle. They
    found the vehicle in the parking lot of the Etobicoke condominium at about 8:23
    p.m. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One of the officers checked the directory inside
    the front door of the Etobicoke condominium building and learned Hobeika was
    listed as the occupant of one of the units. The officer in charge of the
    investigation, who had considerable experience in drug investigations,
    concluded Hobeika may be operating his drug business out of both the Liberty
    Village condominium and the Etobicoke condominium. At about 8:30 p.m., he advised
    the officer, who had prepared the affidavit (ITO) on the application for
    search warrants on the Liberty Village condominium and Hobeikas vehicle, to prepare
    an ITO requesting a warrant on the Etobicoke condominium.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The police continued to gather more information
    as they waited outside of the Etobicoke condominium. The police received
    information that a person, who lived in the Etobicoke condominium building, had
    been charged with drug trafficking in 2011. That person had been released on
    bail with Hobeika as his surety. Under the terms of the bail order, this person
    was obliged to live in Hobeikas unit. The police passed this information on to
    the officer preparing the ITO.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Additional officers arrived outside of the
    Etobicoke condominium. The officer in charge decided that, if Hobeika left the
    condominium and went to his car, the police would stop the vehicle and execute
    the search warrant for the car. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At 9:45 p.m., Hobeika and another person were seen
    leaving the Etobicoke condominium and going to Hobeikas vehicle. When Hobeika
    entered the vehicle, the officer in charge ordered the vehicle blocked and
    instructed the officers to execute the search warrant for the vehicle. The
    officers who stopped the vehicle smelled marihuana in the car and saw, what
    appeared to be, a significant quantity of marihuana in the pocket of the front
    door. The officers also found drugs in the possession of the passenger in Hobeikas
    car. They arrested Hobeika on a charge of possession of marihuana and advised
    him of his right to counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The stopping of Hobeikas vehicle and his arrest
    occurred in plain view of the entrance to the Etobicoke condominium. The arrest
    was loud and public. Hobeika had a cellphone. At least three individuals exited
    the Etobicoke condominium while the stop and arrest were taking place. They
    were seen using their cellphones. One person immediately went back into the
    building. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the police had not yet obtained a
    warrant for Hobeikas condominium unit, the officer in charge decided the
    police would enter the condominium building, proceed to Hobeikas unit and make
    a warrantless entry. He was satisfied the police had reasonable grounds to
    believe there was evidence of narcotics trafficking in Hobeikas unit and there
    was a real risk evidence would be destroyed if he did not act immediately to
    enter the condominium and Hobeikas unit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Three officers entered the common area of the
    condominium building using the key fob seized from Hobeika when he was
    arrested. They made their way to the condominium unit occupied by Hobeika. They
    could hear someone inside. The officer in charge knocked on the door to the
    unit and identified himself as a police officer, falsely indicating he was
    there to perform a bail compliance check. The officer heard steps in the unit
    moving away from the door. The officers broke the door open with a battering ram

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In sum, I conclude that, in order for a

    believed the circumstances called for immediate action to preserve evidence in

    the police have actual knowledge someone was in, or could readily access the
    unit. Instead, it required the police have reasonable grounds to believe there
    was an imminent risk that evidence in the unit would be destroyed before the
    police could obtain and execute a warrant. The evidence accepted by the trial
    judge included evidence a person released on bail for drug trafficking was
    required to live in Hobeikas unit as a term of his bail. While it is true the
    bail order was about two years old, the officers had no reason to believe it
    was not still in effect. That evidence provided a basis for the trial judges

    Counsel submits the unlawful presence of the police in the common area outside

    trial judge found to the contrary. He concluded the requisite urgency was
    established before the police entered the building: <em>Charter</em> Reasons,

    and implementing a strategy which creates an imminent danger evidence will be
    destroyed, and then rely on that imminent danger as justification for acting
    without a warrant. If the police strategy creates the supposed urgency, the
    circumstances are not exigent, but are anticipated, if not planned for, by the

    point, the police had maintained surveillance, waiting for the anticipated

    link between the circumstances creating the urgency relied on to act without a
    warrant and a police action is a step towards showing the police created the
    urgency. In many cases, however, it will be a small step. Often, police action
    will result in the urgency relied on to act without a warrant. The question is
    not whether there is some causative link between police action and the urgency,
    but rather whether that police action reflects a pre-existing plan, which
    included the creation of the circumstances said to justify acting without a
    warrant.</span></p>

    different manner may also have evidentiary value when assessing whether the
    alleged exigent circumstances were created by the police. The availability of a
    different strategy does not, however, mean that the police created the alleged
    urgency. The question is not could the police reasonably have done something
    else, but whether the police operational plan would, in its implementation,
    create the very circumstances said to justify acting without a warrant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the evidence accepted by the trial judge, the
    police did not engage in a pre-planned operation that would create
    circumstances in which the police could act without a warrant. This police
    operation took a turn on the evening of September 15. Until then, the police intended
    to execute a warrant at the Liberty Village condominium when the appellant was
    there. On the evening of September 15, the focus shifted to the Etobicoke
    condominium, after the police had good reason to believe Hobeika was in that
    unit. The plan, however, remained fundamentally the same. The police intended
    to obtain a search warrant and execute the warrant while Hobeika was in the
    condominium. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The plan, however, changed again when Hobeika
    left the condominium before the warrant was obtained. The police reacted to
    this turn of events by choosing to execute the warrant on the vehicle, detain
    and subsequently arrest Hobeika. Unlike the police operation described in <em>Silveira</em>,
    by LaForest J., at para. 85, the police did not choose to structure their
    operation so as to arrest Hobeika outside of the Etobicoke condominium. The
    detention of Hobeikas vehicle and his arrest cannot fairly be described as
    planned in advance  in a planned and calculated procedure: <em>Silveira</em>,
    at para. 85.</span></p>

    perspective, their strategy changed in reaction to a new situation, albeit one
    the officer in charge had contemplated as a possibility while awaiting the
    warrant. The change in circumstances, and not any pre-existing police plan, generated
    the exigent circumstances relied on for the warrantless entry.</span></p>

    and a brief safety search of that unit. None of the information in the ITO was

    believed he would have had reasonable grounds to obtain the warrant if the
    information about what the police heard at Hobeikas door, and what they saw in
    the unit, was not available to him when he swore the ITO. Counsel indicated the
    affiant had testified at the preliminary inquiry he did not believe he had
    grounds for a warrant without that information. </span></p>

    certain place and sets out the grounds for that belief. The affiants belief the
    required grounds exist is fundamental to the integrity of the warrant granting
    process. An affiant who swears the ITO without that belief commits perjury. Furthermore,
    if the affiant does not actually believe the grounds in the ITO provide a basis
    for issuing the warrant, the warrant cannot lawfully issue, regardless of how
    strong the grounds may be for issuing a warrant.</span></p>

    36, former Chief Justice McLachlin emphasizes the qualitative nature of the
    balancing process engaged under s. 24(2). The nature of the s. 24(2) inquiry means,
    in some cases, different judges will reasonably arrive at different conclusions
    with respect to admissibility. I think this case falls into that group.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I come down on the side of admissibility. To exclude
    the evidence obtained in the searches of the condominiums and Hobeikas vehicle
    strikes me as using s. 24(2) more to punish the offending police officers than
    to vindicate the long-term repute of the criminal justice process. The
    appellant has not established the admission of the evidence obtained in the searches
    would, in all the circumstances, bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave careful reasons for
    sentence in which he systematically addressed the evidence, the applicable
    sentencing principles, and the application of those principles to this case: <em>R.

    sentences imposed in cases involving commercial drug dealers and substantial quantities
    of various drugs: see <em>R. v. Oraha</em>, 2014 ONCA 359. The trial judges finding
    the $400,000 in cash and bank drafts was the proceeds of crime was supported by
    overwhelming evidence, as was his finding that the Etobicoke condominium owned
    by Hobeika was offence-related property, within the meaning of s. 18 of the
    CDSA. The trial judges refusal to exercise his discretion and grant relief
    from forfeiture under s. 19.1 of the CDSA reveals no error: <em>R. v. Hobeika</em>,

lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the Crown sought a 6-year penitentiary
    sentence for Sanchez. Counsel for Sanchez argued that Sanchez should receive a
    reformatory sentence. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 4½ years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, counsel again submits a sentence of
    less than two years should be imposed. Counsel now, however, argues Sanchez
    should receive a conditional sentence, rather than an actual term of
    imprisonment. This submission could not be made at trial, as the relevant provisions
    of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> precluded a
    conditional sentence for the crimes Sanchez had committed: </span></em><em>Criminal
    Code</em>, s. 742.1(c), (e)(ii). Subsequent to Sanchezs trial, this court held
    those sections unconstitutional: <em>R. v. Sharma</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2020 ONCA 478</span></em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In urging the court to impose a conditional
    sentence, counsel stresses Sanchezs relative youth, the absence of any
    criminal record, his strong family support, and his positive rehabilitative prospects.
    Counsel also relies on Sanchezs immigration status. Sanchez has been in Canada
    most of his life, but is not a Canadian citizen. If sentenced to a term of imprisonment
    beyond six months, Sanchez is subject to removal from Canada by the immigration
    authorities when his sentence is complete. Were this court to impose a
    conditional sentence, Sanchez would not be subject to a removal order.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sanchezs immigration status is properly taken
    into account on sentencing. It cannot, however, justify the imposition of a
    sentence that is not proportionate to the gravity of the offence, and does not
    adequately reflect the level of Sanchezs culpability: <em>R. v. Pham</em>, 2013
    SCC 15, at paras. 13-19; <em>R. v. Suter</em>, 2018 SCC 34, at paras. 47, 56.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Taking into account the quantity and variety of
    drugs seized from the Etobicoke condominium, and the high volume and lucrative nature
    of the drug operation in which Sanchez was involved, a sentence of less than
    two years would be disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and Sanchezs
    level of culpability. Sanchez was living in the Etobicoke condominium, which
    was clearly a hub of the drug trafficking operation. While Sanchezs role was
    clearly subordinate to that of Hobeika, he was no mere courier. When Hobeika
    left the unit, Sanchez was left in charge of a lot of very valuable product.</span></p>
