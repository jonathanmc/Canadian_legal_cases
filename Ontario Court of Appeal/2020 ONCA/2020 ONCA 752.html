  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 23, 2008, after trial by judge alone in Superior Court of Justice, the appellant was found guilty of sexually assaulting and sexually interfering with his girlfriend's daughter, A.P., contrary to ss. 271 and 151, respectively, of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. He was also found guilty of assaulting his girlfriend's other two daughters, C.M. and E.M., contrary to s. 266.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The incidents occurred between November 2006 and
    January 2007, when the appellant, P.M. (the appellant’s girlfriend at the time,
    and the mother of A.P., C.M. and E.M.), and the children lived together in a
    house in Brampton, Ontario. The appellant’s sister L.S., her husband W.B., and
    their daughter K. also lived in the home during this time period.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 9, 2007, the police were contacted by
    the Children’s Aid Society (“CAS”) in connection with allegations that the
    appellant or P.M. physically assaulted P.M.’s children. The same day, A.P. was
    interviewed by the police. The focus of the interview was on discipline in the
    home. At the end of the interview she was asked if anyone had done anything to
    make her uncomfortable and she said, “No”. The next day, A.P. disclosed to K.
    that the appellant had touched her. K. disclosed this to L.S. and they
    contacted the police. A.P. was brought back for a second interview on January
    11, 2007.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the second interview A.P. was upset that
    K. had disclosed their conversation. A.P. reluctantly told the police that the
    appellant had touched her in her private parts a few times. She also recounted
    one specific incident where the appellant asked her to stay home from school,
    removed her clothes, showed her a book of pornography, and licked her vagina. This
    police statement was a vital part of the Crown’s case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>L.S. and K. testified at trial and provided
    direct and circumstantial evidence that the appellant had hit the children by
    slapping them in the face sometime in December 2006.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the trial, the Crown instituted dangerous
    offender proceedings pursuant to s. 753. The appellant was not a first
    offender. For example, in 1990, he pled guilty to several charges of sexual
    abuse of his step-daughter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The dangerous offender proceedings were delayed
    because the appellant fired his trial counsel and suffered a debilitating stroke
    in 2013. At the hearing, the appellant argued that his severe disabilities
    following his stroke demonstrated that he was not a significant threat to the
    community. He suggested that he should not be designated a dangerous offender
    but that he be designated a long-term offender under s. 753.1. Alternatively,
    he argued that if he was designated a dangerous offender, he should receive a
    fixed sentence with a period of long-term supervision pursuant to s. 753 (4)(b).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge released written reasons on
    January 21, 2015. The trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
    the appellant met the criteria for a dangerous offender designation, and he
    imposed an indeterminate sentence.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his convictions and seeks
    a new trial. He advances five grounds of appeal. He contends that the trial
    judge erred by:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>failing to give sufficient reasons on the sexual
    assault count;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>using A.P.’s initial police statement to bolster
    the credibility of the sexual abuse allegations that she made in her second
    police statement;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>failing to consider evidence with respect to
    A.P.’s credibility, in particular evidence supporting the defence theory of her
    motive to fabricate;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span lang=EN-CA>(iv)</span><span lang=EN-CA>relying too
    heavily on the demeanour of A.P.; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber><span
lang=EN-CA>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>improperly taking judicial notice of the knowledge and behaviour of
    children in the context of sexual abuse absent expert evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Should his appeal from conviction fail, the appellant
    also argues that the trial judge improperly imposed an indeterminate sentence. The
    appellant submits that the trial judge completely ignored the vast majority of
    the expert evidence regarding his risk of re-offending given his physical disabilities.
    According to the appellant, this evidence supported a determinate sentence and
    a long-term supervision order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss

    In <em>Khan (ONCA)</em>, Robins J.A. observed, at p. 210, that young children
    are generally not adept at “fabricating tales of sexual perversion” and are
    manifestly “unlikely to use their reflective powers to concoct a deliberate
    untruth, and particularly one about a sexual act which in all probability is
    beyond their ken.” The Supreme Court of Canada reiterated that the fact that
    the young complainant in that case “could not be expected to have knowledge of such
    sexual acts imbue[d] her statement with its own peculiar stamp of reliability.”: <em>Khan</em> (<em>SCC)</em>, at p. 548.</span></p>

    A.P. did so for the purpose of living with K. However, once A.P. realized that
    K. had disclosed their conversation to the police she was stuck with this lie

lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that while the household
    may have been very busy, the appellant did have an opportunity to periodically
    commit acts of sexual touching and the acts described by A.P. on the day she
    stayed home from school. First, he found that while P.M. had young children,
    that did not mean that she never went out of the home. Second, he found that although
    K. may have often been at home in the morning did not mean that she was home
    each and every morning.</span></p>

    observed that A.P. gave every indication of being a truthful witness in the

    divulge evidence and was upset that K. had disclosed their conversation.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also highlighted that during the

    with the sexual activity:</span></p>

    for 5 more minutes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge viewed A.P.’s description of the
    sexual activity as credible and reliable because there was no evidence that
    such lurid description of sexual activities would have been planted in A.P.’s
    mind. He noted that there was no evidence that A.P. had ever been previously
    exposed to any sexually explicit material. He found that there was also no
    evidence that A.P. ever discussed sex with K. Finally, while the trial judge
    accepted that while there may have been knowledge in the household that the
    appellant had been in jail or had a criminal record, A.P. appeared to be
    genuinely surprised when it was revealed that the record related to sexual
    assaults and the trial judge rejected the suggestion that she knew about this
    prior to her disclosure.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge acknowledged that there was an
    inconsistency between the first and second statements. However, from his
    perspective, there were aspects of this first statement that were significant
    only with the benefit of hindsight. After reviewing specific portions of the
    first statement, he found that A.P. was not trying to get her mother in trouble
    in the statement and that the focus of the first statement was on the means by
    which A.P. and the other children in the home were disciplined. He found that A.P.
    had told her mother that the appellant had asked her to stay home from school
    and that her mother did not believe her. This may have made A.P. reluctant to
    disclose what had happened during the first statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He addressed the inconsistency in the following
    way:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[A]s I said, there are references in the
    January 9<sup>th</sup> transcript which only, with the benefit of hindsight,
    indicate quite clearly that A.P. had something else to say and specifically
    indicate that there was something she wanted to say about the day she was asked
    by the accused to stay home. So I take that into account not as a prior
    consistent statement somehow enhancing credibility, but explaining what was
    said to be an inconsistency that diminished credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the end, he found A.P. was a credible and

    touching had taken place on more than one occasion; and that the appellant had
    asked A.P. to come home from school and sexually assaulted her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    credibility and reliability of A.P.’s evidence. In my view, the appellant is
    asking this court to re-visit the trial judge’s careful credibility findings in
    the absence of any overriding and palpable error. Respectfully, I see no basis
    to interfere with the trial judge’s credibility assessment. Very high deference
    is owed to his credibility findings: <em>R. v. Vuradin</em>, 2013 SCC 38,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Count 1 on the indictment alleged that the
    appellant sexually assaulted A.P. between November 2006 and January 2007. After
    noting that A.P. was a credible and reliable witness, the trial judge found the
    appellant guilty of this count because he was satisfied that A.P. “very
    clearly” testified to sexual touching in addition to the incident when she
    returned home from school.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge
    provided insufficient reasons in connection with the first count. He advances
    two submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant contends that the trial
    judge failed to resolve contradictory evidence regarding whether there were
    opportunities for him to commit the offence. On the one hand, A.P.’s evidence was
    that the sexual assaults would occur when he would sneak into her room in the
    evening and touch her while she wore a nightdress. On the other hand, L.S. and
    K. testified that the appellant worked a night shift at Walmart. The appellant
    submits that the trial judge did not explain how this evidence could be
    reconciled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see nothing in this submission. The trial
    judge recognized that the appellant worked a night shift. However, this did not
    mean he did not have the opportunity to commit the offence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A.P. told the police that the appellant had
    touched her a “few times” in addition to the incident when she returned home
    from school and her mother was not home. The trial judge accepted her evidence.
    In my view, the trial judge’s finding that there were opportunities to commit
    sexual assault in addition to the incident when A.P. returned home from school
    was firmly anchored in the evidence. That evidence included the following:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A.P. told the police officer in the second
    interview that the appellant “used to come out at night” <span class=Underline>and</span> “come out in the morning”; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>K. testified that the appellant worked <span
class=Underline>most</span> times at night but when he arrived home the
    appellant would wake the girls up to go to school.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also submits that the trial judge
    failed to resolve a contradiction between evidence of the appellant’s work
    schedule and evidence provided by K. who testified that A.P. told her that the
    abuse took place almost every night when A.P. would go to bed. I disagree. The
    trial judge expressly noted and reviewed K.’s evidence on this point in his
    reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When A.P. told her what the accused had been
    doing, A.P. said it was over the whole time she lived at Ashurst. The accused
    never behaved inappropriately to [K.] and in re-examination [K.] said that when
    A.P. reported it happened over the whole time, she did not say that it happened
    every night.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge resolved the evidence. He was
    entitled to accept that K. had clarified her evidence in re-examination: <em>R.
    v. Candir</em>, 2009 ONCA 915, 250 C.C.C. (3d) 139, at para. 148, and it is
    obvious from his reasons that he found that there was no contradictory
    evidence. Furthermore, I note that this apparent contradiction was of limited
    value because A.P. was never confronted during cross-examination with her prior
    statement to K. about how often and at what time of day the sexual assaults
    took place.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #2: The Trial Judge Improperly Used
    A.P.’s Police Statements</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A.P.’s second statement to the police was not
    consistent with her first statement, in which she denied that the appellant
    touched her private parts. The appellant argues that the trial judge erred by
    finding that the significance of the inconsistency was reduced or explained
    based on his finding, “with the benefit of hindsight”, that A.P. had more to
    say during the first statement. The appellant submits that this error led the
    trial judge to improperly use the absence of any sexual abuse allegation in
    A.P.’s first statement to bolster her credibility when assessing the second
    statement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the appellant that the trial
    judge’s comment that “A.P. had something else to say” in the first statement is
    speculative. Although the trial judge set out several examples of what he
    believed were instances of A.P. wanting to say more about the appellant, the
    fact is that A.P. acknowledged in her cross-examination that she was “sort of lying”
    to the police in the first statement. Further, there was no direct evidence
    that she wanted to say more about the assaults during her first interview.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That said, if this was an error, it was of no
    great moment. The trial judge expressly stated that he was not using these two
    statements as prior consistent statements, to bolster A.P.’s credibility. Instead,
    what the trial judge found is that because the first statement was not
    complete, the significance of the inconsistency was reduced. Although the
    underlying premise for that finding is problematic, I am satisfied that the trial
    judge’s impugned comments were made to simply respond to the defence argument
    that there was an inconsistency that could diminish the weight of her testimony
    and he did not use it to add to her credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons reveals
    that his reasoning process was focused on squarely dealing with defence
    counsel’s submission that A.P. was motivated to fabricate all the allegations
    for the purpose of living with K. and because she disliked the appellant. The
    trial judge explained in detail why he accepted what A.P. was saying in her
    second statement. In his view, it was A.P.’s ability to recount lurid and
    specific details of sexual activities and the absence of any prior exposure to
    explicit sexual information that would plant ideas in her mind that made A.P.’s
    allegations credible and reliable. The trial judge noted:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the second statement she was quite emphatic
    that she was telling the truth. I have considered the defence theory of this
    but there is no evidence that she was exposed to explicit sexual information or
    material that would assist her to come up with this fabrication. I agree she
    had a very strong motive to dislike or even hate the accused. She wanted him in
    jail but I think if this motivation was animating A.P., I would have expected
    her to be a lot more forthcoming about her allegations against the accused and
    I would have expected the complaint to have described acts that would be much
    more straightforward than the complaint that was made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the end, the trial judge dealt specifically
    with the defence theory, and provided several cogent reasons as to why he found
    A.P. to be credible and reliable. The trial judge’s comments in relation to his
    finding that A.P. had more to say in her first statement, to find that the impact
    of the inconsistency between the two statements was reduced, occasioned no
    prejudice. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge
    improperly relied on demeanour evidence to enhance A.P.’s credibility. First,
    he takes issue with the trial judge’s observations that there was nothing in
    A.P.’s demeanour that suggested to him that she was not attempting to be
    truthful and that A.P. was “quite emphatic” that she was telling the truth in
    the second statement. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    expressing an impression of how a young witness has testified in assessing
    their credibility: see <em>R. v. J.J.B.</em>, 2013 ONCA 268, 305 O.A.C. 201, at
    para. 112. Read fairly, the trial judge’s reasons reveal that he was
    referencing A.P.’s age (ten years old) when she provided her two videotaped
    statements. She was a child, and the trial judge was entitled to assess her
    ability to perceive and recall as a child: <em>R. v. B. (G.)</em>, [1990] 2
    S.C.R. 30, at pp. 54-55.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the trial judge cautioned himself that
    he should not place undue reliance on demeanour in his credibility assessment
    and stated that he did not attach too much significance to it. This caution
    belies any suggestion that he was using demeanour evidence improperly. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that the trial judge
    unfairly made no reference to A.P.’s hostile testimonial demeanour or her reluctance
    to speak about her dishonesty or other events that presented her in a negative
    light. He submits that the trial judge unfairly ignored the hostile nature of
    A.P.’s presentation during cross-examination and was uneven in his assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While I agree with the appellant that
    testimonial demeanour can be a proper consideration in the evaluation of a
    witness’s credibility, the trial judge’s silence on this point does not amount
    to reversible error. It is difficult for this court to assess this submission
    because this court does not have the benefit that the trial judge did in
    viewing the demeanour of A.P. during the critical exchanges with defence
    counsel. Even assuming that the demeanour of A.P. was hostile to counsel during
    cross-examination, the testimonial demeanour of A.P. certainly was not a
    material issue raised by defence counsel. Indeed, the silence of defence
    counsel on this point during closing submissions fortifies my conclusion that
    A.P.’s testimonial demeanour during cross-examination played no or at best, a
    peripheral role in this trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant complains that the trial judge

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, he takes issue with the trial judge
    relying on <em>Khan (ONCA)</em> for the point that young children are generally
    not adept at “fabricating tales of sexual perversion”. The appellant argues
    that this led the judge to undermine the defence theory by making findings
    about the knowledge and behaviour of children in the context of sexual abuse
    without any expert evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant complains that the trial
    judge improperly undermined the defence theory that it was incredible that A.P.
    would lie and stay home from school if she was in fact a victim of repeated
    sexual abuse and disliked the appellant. The trial judge did so by stating that
    “it is common knowledge that very often victims subject themselves to repeated
    assaults”, and that “[y]ou only need to look at the Law Reports to see that
    that is a common occurrence where assaults take place over a period of time and
    complainants simply find themselves unable to make a report”.</span></p>

    proof of facts that are clearly uncontroversial or beyond reasonable dispute. Facts
    judicially noticed are not proved by evidence under oath. Nor are they tested
    by cross-examination. Therefore, the threshold for judicial notice is strict<em>:
    R. v. Find</em>, 2001 SCC 32, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 863, at para. 48.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Turning to the first submission, the trial judge
    was not taking judicial notice of how young children behave; he was simply
    noting this court’s comments in <em>Khan (ONCA)</em>, that young children are
    generally not adept at “fabricating tales of sexual perversion” and comparing
    the observation made by Robins J.A. in that case with the evidence in this
    case. The following passage from the trial judge’s reasons shows that he was
    not taking judicial notice. After citing <em>Khan (ONCA)</em>, the trial judge
    stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I did a computer search to look at cases that
    quoted this passage. All of the cases I found involved children much younger
    than ten years old. I make this point because as far as I am concerned, the
    rationale that Justice Robbins [<em>sic</em>] has referred to, continues to
    have application, although with less force as a child grows older. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>But in every case it is
    important to consider the evidence in the particular case.</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> There is no evidence here of A.P. being exposed to sexually
    explicit material. There is no discussion with [K.] about sex. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge reasoned that A.P.’s
    account was credible and reliable because there was no evidence that A.P. had
    been exposed to sexual literature; she did not know what he had been charged
    with; and there was no evidence that she knew what a lubricant was. The trial
    judge was not dispensing with facts. I agree with the respondent’s submission
    that the trial judge was instead, through a reasoned process, drawing on <em>Khan
    (ONCA)</em> as a roadmap for determining whether A.P.’s evidence was credible
    and reliable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s second submission is also
    unpersuasive. In my view, the trial judge was responding to the questionable
    assertion advanced by defence counsel during her closing address that A.P.
    would not have decided to stay at home from school to be with the appellant if
    she had previously been abused by him or disliked him. Although it was not put
    exactly in these terms, I view the trial judge as expressing his disagreement
    with this submission because there are several reasons why, even if sexual
    abuse occurred, A.P. would have stayed home from school. As the Supreme Court
    of Canada has noted “there is no inviolable rule on how people who are the
    victims of trauma like sexual assault will behave”: <em>R. v. D.D.</em>, 2000
    SCC 43, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275, at para. 65. The Supreme Court expressed its
    opinion that trial judges should routinely instruct juries with this common
    sense proposition. Indeed, juries are typically instructed about this fact
    without the need for expert evidence. A trial judge cannot be faulted for
    expressing the same proposition in reasons for judgment on a judge alone trial.
    I view his comments as nothing more than an alternate way of expressing this
    proposition and he did not require expert evidence as a foundation for his
    observations.</span></p>

    was treatable and whether treatment offered any reasonable possibility that his
    risk could be managed within the community, Dr.&nbsp;Wilkie concluded that his
    prognosis was extremely poor.</span></p>

    stroke and the impact it may have had on her conclusion that the appellant’s
    risk could not be managed. She testified that pedohebephilia is a persistent
    trait that would not be affected by stroke related impairments, although it may
    affect his ability to act on his preferences and drives. While she acknowledged
    that the appellant required some assistance in daily living, the nature and extent
    of the required assistance was not clear. She could not discount his ability to
    enter into a domestic relationship by reason of his stroke.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, while Dr. Gojer questioned whether the
    appellant was at a high risk to reoffend, Dr. Gojer agreed that he was not an
    expert on functional abilities and was relying on Dr. Lipson’s report. The
    trial judge made strong findings against Dr.&nbsp;Lipson’s report and found
    that it was almost boilerplate. The trial judge concluded that the report was
    not a “comprehensive assessment of [the appellant’s] functional abilities or a
    report regarding his future residential care needs”. In his view, Dr. Lipson’s
    report only gave him a vague idea of the appellant’s functional abilities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge carefully balanced
    all the relevant considerations including the appellant’s antecedents, his
    ongoing needs, and the paramount objective of the protection of the public from
    his high risk to reoffend against children. There is no basis to interfere with
    the trial judge’s decision to impose an indeterminate sentence.</span></p>
