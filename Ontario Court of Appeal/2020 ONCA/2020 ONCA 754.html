    that he had given an undertaking not to consume alcohol and breached it by
    consuming alcohol on July&nbsp;29, 2016 when he was arrested by the police. The
    appellant testified and denied making any of the threats or committing the
    assault with which he was charged. He admitted having sex with the complainant
    on the dates of the alleged assaults but said that the sex was consensual.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    – and count six – uttering a threat in May 2016. He delivered written reasons for

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He accepted the complainant’s evidence that the appellant’s
    threat to her in March 2016 (count five) was clear and specific and was meant
    to intimidate her.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He accepted the complainant’s evidence about the

    did not consent to sexual activity with the appellant on July 27 and 28 (counts
    three and four), and that the complainant had communicated her lack of consent
    to the appellant. He also found that the appellant’s sexual assault on July 27
    was preceded by a threat, which was meant to and did intimidate her (count seven).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant makes two arguments in his notice
    of appeal. The first is that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence. The
    second, in a supplementary notice of appeal, is that he had ineffective
    assistance of counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Duty counsel adds another ground. He submits that
    the trial Crown improperly cross-examined the appellant on the conduct on which
    his previous convictions were based. Although s. 12(1) of the <em>Canada
    Evidence Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, authorizes a witness to be questioned
    on whether the witness has been convicted of any offence, courts have limited this
    type of questioning to the facts of the conviction, including the offence, the
    date and the place of the conviction, and the punishment imposed: <em>R. v. M.C.</em>,
    2019 ONCA 502, 376 C.C.C. (3d) 81, <em>per </em>Watt J.A., at paras.&nbsp;53-55.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent concedes that the trial Crown
    went too far in exploring the details of the conduct underlying the appellant’s
    prior convictions in cross-examination. However, the respondent submits that
    careful examination of the trial judge’s reasons establish that trial fairness
    was not impaired and that this was the sort of error for which use of the
    proviso would be warranted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case the criminal record was put into
    evidence by defence counsel. The copy ultimately filed with the trial judge as
    an exhibit had the trial Crown’s handwritten annotations on it describing what
    the individual offences were about. Duty counsel does not fault trial defence
    counsel for introducing this evidence because the record was bound to be put to
    the appellant in cross-examination, making it good trial strategy to minimize
    its effect by getting it out early. However, duty counsel argues that the
    cumulative effect of the Crown’s improper cross-examination was to substantiate
    the appellant’s problems with alcohol, his history of domestic violence, his
    tendency to minimize his own behaviour and to lie to courts in order to
    minimize the personal consequences of his actions. Duty counsel argues that
    this tainted the trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s credibility,
    encouraged prejudicial reasoning on the trial judge’s part, and therefore led
    to a miscarriage of justice. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not accept this argument. While we agree
    that the Crown’s cross-examination on the appellant’s record was improper, we
    do not agree that it unduly influenced the trial judge’s approach to the case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge instructed himself appropriately
    on the burden of proof, citing <em>R. v. Lifchus</em>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, at
    para. 27. He did the same respecting the principles set out in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at pp. 757-8. He instructed himself that demeanor evidence
    was an unreliable factor in the assessment of credibility and not to give it
    undue weight.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge was alive to the tensions in the
    law. First, he cited the observation of Doherty J.A. that: “The existence of
    previous criminal convictions may render a witness less credible”: <em>R. v.
    Watson</em> (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 310, at p. 334, [1996] O.J. No. 2695 (C.A.)
    at para. 76. Second, the trial judge was careful in instructing himself that:
    “While I can rely on his record, I cannot use it to infer propensity to commit
    the offences before the court,” citing <em>R. v. Corbett</em>, [1988] 1 S.C.R.
    670 at para. 21.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge enumerated briefly the 20
    convictions on the appellant’s record. In his analysis of the issues at trial,
    the trial judge returned to the criminal record, and made these observations:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>First, he minimized his criminal record. Mr.
    Watkins has a lengthy criminal record with convictions for crimes of violence.
    Some are driving-related which involve alcohol. Arguably, this cannot be an
    easy thing to be questioned on, and one would expect some downplaying, but Mr.&nbsp;Watkins
    refused to acknowledge his role in his criminal antecedents. He testified that
    most of the times he pled guilty to get out of jail. In cross-examination, he
    was given an opportunity to explain what he meant. When it was suggested to him
    that this meant he might have lied to the court (if he was not guilty of the
    offences) just to get out of jail, he did not correct or explain this
    assertion. He remained adamant “he just wanted to get out of jail,” implying he
    was not really guilty of the offences. This is problematic.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The third tension in the law concerns propensity
    reasoning. The trial judge noted that in cases involving domestic
    relationships, “extrinsic evidence” can be led not for propensity reasoning but
    in order to provide context to the relationship, particularly where it can
    explain why a person remains in an abusive relationship: <em>R. v. F.(D.S.)</em> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), [1999] O.J. No. 688.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The extrinsic evidence led by the Crown was
    limited to the other counts on the information and instances of verbal and
    emotional abuse. It is entirely relevant to explain why [the complainant]
    remained in the relationship, which of course is being challenged by the
    defence as a key issue which speaks against her credibility. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I accept the evidence of [the complainant] as
    to why she stayed in the relationship. In contrast, I reject Mr.&nbsp;Watkins’
    characterization of their relationship as “good”… [The complainant] testified
    that the relationship was emotionally and verbally abusive and this was a
    longstanding issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case turned on the trial judge’s credibility
    findings. He did not believe the appellant, pointing out that there were
    several areas of his evidence that were internally inconsistent and also
    inconsistent with his prior statements, including his statements to the police.
    He noted that the appellant tried to minimize his lengthy criminal record and
    minimized his alcohol consumption.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By contrast, the trial judge found the
    complainant to be forthright and consistent in her evidence. He accepted her
    evidence that the appellant’s drinking was excessive and that when he abused alcohol,
    he became angry and disruptive. The complainant’s sister provided corroborative
    evidence that she had to take the step of banning him from her home.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In assessing the complainant’s credibility, the
    trial judge found that she had no motive to fabricate relating to the
    termination of their domestic relationship nor, more specifically, in order to
    gain an advantage in the division of their assets. He found that their
    confrontation on the division of assets occurred after the assaults.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s self instructions were
    thoughtful, correct, and complete, and his reasons were comprehensive and
    detailed. The appellant has demonstrated no palpable and overriding errors or
    misapprehensions of the evidence by the trial judge. Nor are there any errors
    of law.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant made submissions in addition to
    duty counsel and elaborated on the argument set out in a supplementary notice
    of appeal that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. The appellant
    had in 2018 obtained a limited order under s. 684 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> for assistance and a review of this claim, but no counsel is before the court
    making this argument.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the fresh evidence relating to
    the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the appellant makes four
    allegations:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span
lang=EN-CA>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel failed to do an effective cross-examination on the

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel undermined the fairness and the
    appearance of representation of the trial and the reliability of the outcome of
    the verdict;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel’s conduct of incompetence and
    ineffectiveness is the cause for a miscarriage of justice which in turn
    affected the verdict; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial counsel “failed to hear my side of these
    allegations and events which is required by law to do so. Trial counsel [failed
    to inform me of these allegations at any time and did not discuss any
    strategies].”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These allegations were refined further in
    communications between the Crown and trial counsel. The Crown invited trial
    counsel to respond to the following allegations:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span
lang=EN-CA>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The videotape statement – Mr. Watkins alleges that you did not view
    his videotaped statement to police before conceding its voluntariness.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The allegations – Mr. Watkins states that you
    did not review the allegations with him, and he did not know the nature of the
    case against him.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial preparation – Mr. Watkins alleges that you
    never discussed trial strategy with him; did not ask his side of the story; and
    never explained to him what would happen when he took the stand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response, trial counsel advised:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span
lang=EN-CA>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I did review the video statement of Mr. Watkins but, I did not view
    the video with Mr. Watkins himself. I told him I had reviewed it and confirmed
    that it was similar to the written synopsis that the Crown had provided in the
    disclosure. I reviewed that with him and he recalled what he said to police. He
    was fine with what he had told police and did not express any issues with that
    aspect of his evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I reviewed all allegations with Mr. Watkins. I
    read out the disclosure to him over the videolink meetings we had in
    preparation for trial. He knew exactly what the allegations were against him
    and he is the one that gave me the background of the relationship in order to
    cross-examine the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I always discussed trial strategy with Mr.
    Watkins. We discussed whether he wanted to take the stand. We discussed how we
    would cross-examine the complainant and the fact that her sister would also be
    testifying. I went over their statements with Mr.&nbsp;Watkins and he gave me
    the history to cross-examine the witnesses and his side of the story. I was
    fully aware of Mr. Watkins version of events. He told me several times what his
    position was and I tried to place that before his Honour as best I could. I
    also discussed with him what it meant to take the stand. He seemed to be fully
    prepared to answer questions from the Crown. When I discussed my expectation,
    he seemed to understand. At least, he led me to believe he understood and was
    still prepared to take the stand so the Judge had his side of the story.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his oral submissions before this court, the
    appellant focussed on the complaint that defence counsel had put his criminal
    record into issue, and that he was not prepared for the questions that counsel
    asked. As duty counsel pointed out, defence counsel cannot be faulted for
    adducing the appellant’s record. We addressed the problems with the cross-examination
    on the record earlier but note that defence counsel did not object to it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this record, with the substantial evidence
    against the appellant, we are unable to find that defence counsel provided him
    with ineffective assistance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The notice of appeal included a sentence appeal
    but did not set out the grounds. Neither the appellant nor duty counsel
    addressed the sentence appeal, nor did they abandon it. Since leave to appeal
    sentence was not pursued, leave to appeal sentence is denied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
