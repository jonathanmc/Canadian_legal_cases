    distributing intimate images without consent. He and another male had
    videotaped each other sexually assaulting the complainant at a house party while
    she was unconscious. The applicant then circulated the video on a group chat on
    Snapchat. The applicant was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment followed by
    two years’ probation and various ancillary orders.</span></p>

    at a house party attended by 15 to 20 people at the house of the complainant
    (then aged 18), whom he knew from high school. Her parents were away. Everyone
    was drinking, including the complainant. She had also been smoking marijuana.
    At about 1:40&nbsp;a.m., she felt intoxicated and dizzy, so she went upstairs, lay
    on her parents’ bed, and fell asleep, fully clothed in jeans and a T-shirt.</span></p>

    down. She had pain in her lower abdomen and was bleeding from her vagina. A
    friend told her he had received sexual videos of her and some males through a
    group chat on Snapchat. She did not recall engaging in sexual activity, but remembered
    seeing the applicant in the bedroom, and thought it must have been he who recorded
    the videos because she recalled seeing him through the flash of a camera. She
    also remembered waking up and seeing three or four people in the room laughing.
    She told them to get out and fell asleep again.</span></p>

    seized his cellphone incident to arrest and later obtained a warrant to search it.
    They found the videos on his phone, which showed the applicant penetrating the
    complainant’s vagina with a brush handle while laughing and another male
    digitally penetrating the complainant while the applicant filmed. The
    complainant appeared to be unconscious.</span></p>

    J. of the Ontario Court of Justice appointed counsel for the applicant under s.
    486.3 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to conduct any
    cross-examination of the complainant at the applicant’s preliminary inquiry, scheduled
    for July 8, 2019. The applicant previously had a lawyer but could no longer
    afford him.</span></p>

    preliminary inquiry, scheduled before Maxwell J. of the Ontario Court of
    Justice — the applicant’s counsel asked for the matter to be held down until
    after a break to explore resolution. It appears from the record before me that
    by July 6, 2019, the applicant had personally retained her since she later
    issued an invoice to the applicant himself. On the afternoon of July 8, the
    applicant’s counsel advised the court that the applicant would plead guilty to the
    lesser included offence of sexual assault <em>simpliciter</em> (rather than
    gang sexual assault) and distributing intimate images without consent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applicant’s counsel advised Maxwell J. that the
    applicant’s guilty plea was an informed plea, reached after the applicant had
    several opportunities to meet with counsel and review the Crown disclosure with
    her:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>So, I can advise Your Honour that<span
style='color:black'> </span>this is an informed plea; that Mr. [T.S.D.] has an
    opportunity, several opportunities to meet with me and review the disclosure.
    He does understand that in entering a guilty plea today he is giving up his
    right to a trial and any defences that may be available to him.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>He does understand that whatever position on
    sentence the Crown takes <span style='color:black'>is not going to be </span>the
    same position as the defence and that ultimately the position on sentence <span
style='color:black'>is going to be </span>up to Your Honour. He does understand <span style='color:black'>that </span>these convictions, likely convictions,
    that will result from his guilty pleas will form part of his criminal record.
    And he is doing so voluntarily <span style='color:black'>without any </span>pressure
    from any outside sources. Is all of that correct, Mr. [T.S.D.]?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[T.S.D.]: Yes, ma’am.</span></p>

    counsel framework is not relevant to whether a guilty plea is informed. The
    ineffective assistance of counsel framework “focuses on the <em>source</em> of
    the misinformation (or incomplete information) rather than the misinformation
    itself. Assessing whether prejudice arises from misinformation does not depend
    upon its source”: <em>Wong</em>, at para. 24 (emphasis in original); see also

    guilty plea on July 8, 2019, I am fortified in my conclusion that there is no
    arguable ground of appeal by what was said during sentencing submissions on March
    3, 2020. Crown counsel stated: “Given that the Crown has proceeded by
    indictment, a SOIRA order is also mandatory for 20 years.” The applicant’s counsel
    then reiterated this: “we also need to take into account the other consequences
    of this conviction; a criminal record and a lengthy SOIRA order.” The sentence was
    not imposed until September 22, 2020 — seven months later. Yet there is no
    evidence that between the sentencing submissions and when the sentence was
    imposed the applicant expressed any concern about the SOIRA order. To the
    contrary, at the close of the sentencing submissions, the applicant apologized
    and expressed remorse for the offence.</span></p>

    dockets reveal that she reviewed the Crown disclosure with the applicant several
    times, met with him to prepare for the preliminary inquiry, and spent time
    preparing to cross-examine witnesses. She reviewed the law on consent, intoxication,
    and voluntariness. She discussed the applicant’s jeopardy with him “at length”.
    Her dockets also record his instructions to her to plead guilty on the day of
    his plea. She then prepared for sentencing and delivered what<span

    the sentence sought by the Crown and at the low point of the range mentioned to

    his parents under their supervision. He also proposes to wear an ankle monitor.
    On this basis, I conclude that the applicant meets the second criterion for

    considerations: (i) an individual must pose a “substantial likelihood” of
    committing an offence or interfering with the administration of justice; (ii)
    the “substantial likelihood” must endanger the “protection or safety of the
    public”; and (iii) the individual’s detention must be “necessary” for public

    contend this. The applicant is a first-time offender. There is no evidence of a

    the administration of justice. However, his offences were serious, so I cannot
    say his release would pose no public safety concerns. In any event, I am satisfied

    weighing two competing interests: enforceability and reviewability.
    Enforceability concerns the need to respect the general rule of the immediate
    enforceability of all judgments. Reviewability concerns the need to provide for
    a meaningful review process, one that does not require persons convicted of
    offences to serve all or a significant part of their sentence only to have
    their conviction overturned on appeal: <em>Oland</em>, at paras. 24-26.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In assessing the enforceability interest, the
    seriousness of the crime plays an important role. The more serious the crime,
    the greater the risk that public confidence in the administration of justice
    will be undermined if the person convicted is released on bail pending appeal: <em>Oland</em>,
    at para. 37. The absence of flight or public safety risks will attenuate the
    enforceability interest. Other factors should also be considered where
    appropriate: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 39.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, I find the enforceability interest is
    significant. The applicant was convicted of two serious sexual offences. He sexually
    assaulted the complainant when she was incapacitated and vulnerable. He
    assaulted her in her home, a place where she should have felt safe. He used an implement
    to violate her in a way that was especially degrading and humiliating. He did so
    with others, recorded the encounter, and then circulated it to a group. He revealed
    a callous demeanour during the assault, laughing and smiling as he continued. All
    this has had a lasting impact on the complainant, as she revealed in her victim
    impact statement. The applicant disputes none of these essential facts.</span></p>

    grounds in the notice of appeal for their general legal plausibility and
    foundation in the record, to determine whether those grounds clearly surpass
    the “not frivolous” criterion: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 44. A broader public

    circumstances of the case and respectful of society’s fundamental values”: <em>Oland</em>,
    at para. 47. Anticipated delay in deciding an appeal, relative to the length of
    the sentence, is also a consideration, to ensure that the reviewability
    interest remains meaningful: <em>Oland</em>, at para. 48.</span></p>
