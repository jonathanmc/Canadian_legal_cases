  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Hourigan J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Part I: Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The appellant, Robert
    Irwin, was charged with failing to comply with six orders issued pursuant to the <em>Building Code Act</em> 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 23 (the “<em>Act</em>”). The
    orders required him to obtain building permits for certain structures on his
    property or remove them. He did not appeal those orders. Instead, he raised as his
    primary defence at trial for some orders that he had obtained the required
    building permits years before the orders were issued. For the other orders, he
    argued that he did not need a building permit. The respondent submitted that
    these defences were unavailable because they amounted to a collateral attack on
    the orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The justice of the
    peace who conducted the trial found that the collateral attack rule was
    inapplicable and acquitted Mr. Irwin. On appeal, the Ontario Court of Justice
    found that the justice of the peace erred in law on the issue and that the
    collateral attack rule precluded Mr. Irwin from asserting his defences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>As I will explain, in
    my view, the appeal judge erred in finding that the collateral attack rule
    applied with respect to the defence asserted for all but two of the charges. I
    would, therefore, allow the appeal in part.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Part II: Facts</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Mr. Irwin has owned the
    land and premises municipally known as 5781 Highway 7 in the City of Vaughan,
    in the Regional Municipality of York, since the early 1970s. Between 1973 and
    1996, Mr. Irwin entered into various site plan agreements with York and applied
    for building permits.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>In 1996, an inspector
    from the Vaughan Building Standards Department issued six orders to comply with
    respect to buildings on the property numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (the “1996
    Orders”). Those orders required Mr. Irwin to obtain a building permit for the
    relevant buildings or remove them. Mr. Irwin was eventually charged under the <em>Act</em> with failure to comply with the 1996 Orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Mr. Irwin’s evidence
    was that after he was charged with breach of the 1996 Orders, he gave his then
    lawyer, Scott Sievert, building permits related to buildings numbered 1, 2, 5,
    6, and 7. For buildings numbered 3 and 4, Mr. Irwin was of the view that no
    permits were required. He testified that the city asked him to submit a site
    plan for all the buildings, which he did in 1996. Shortly thereafter, he was
    told by Mr. Sievert that the charges would be withdrawn. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Mr. Irwin testified
    that he complied with the 1996 Orders. His evidence was that the permits were
    kept in his lawyer’s office. However, they were later destroyed in a fire that
    also took Mr. Sievert’s life.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Mr. Irwin heard nothing
    further on the issue of permits from the respondent for 17 years.  Then in
    2013, a different inspector from the City of Vaughan issued new orders to comply
    (the “2013 Orders”). These new orders were identical to the 1996 Orders; they
    alleged the same infractions, almost verbatim, and attached the same hand-drawn
    Schedule &quot;A&quot; of Mr. Irwin's property. The only differences were that
    new order numbers were added, and they indicated on their face that they
    replaced the 1996 Orders. The required action stated on each order to comply
    was, “obtain the required building permit or remove the unauthorized
    construction and restore the building/property to its former state.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Mr. Irwin took no fresh
    steps to comply with the 2013 Orders. He also did not avail himself of the
    appeal route in s. 25 of the <em>Act</em>, which provides:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A person who considers themself
    aggrieved by an order or decision made by the chief building official, a
    registered code agency or an inspector under this Act (except a decision under
    subsection 8 (3) not to issue a conditional permit) may appeal the order or
    decision to the Superior Court of Justice within 20 days after the order or
    decision is made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The respondent charged
    Mr. Irwin with six counts of contravening s. 36(1) of the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>, due to
    his non-compliance with the 2013 Orders. Before the trial on these charges, the
    respondent did not disclose documentation regarding the 1996 Orders and
    resisted an application to produce those documents. The justice of the peace
    ordered that the documents be produced, and the respondent successfully
    appealed that order to the Superior Court. On a further appeal to this court,
    the order of the justice of the peace was reinstated. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>At trial, Mr. Irwin
    testified that no additional buildings or structures were erected after 1996.
    He explained that he obtained the required building permits from the 1970s
    through to 1996. He did not, however, produce any building permits at trial.
    Mr. Irwin’s evidence was that he gave any permits in his possession to Mr.
    Sievert to deal with the 1996 charges. All were subsequently lost in the fire. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The respondent adduced
    no evidence that any of the renovations or alterations that were the subject of
    the 2013 Orders were done after 1996. The extent of the respondent’s evidence
    about the timing of the renovations and alterations came from its building
    inspector, who testified that they were done after the construction of the
    original buildings based on his visual inspection. He also gave evidence that
    no relevant building permits were found in a search of the respondent's files.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Among the documents
    produced were copies of Mr. Irwin’s applications for various building permits
    for buildings 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. Some of those documents bear both an
    application number and a second stamped number that Mr. Irwin claims is a
    building permit number. The building inspector who issued the 2013 Orders
    testified that the stamped number is assigned to an application on its receipt.
    The same number will eventually be used as a building permit number if a permit
    is granted. Therefore, according to the building inspector, the stamped number
    Mr. Irwin was relying on was not necessarily indicative that a permit had been
    issued. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Mr. Irwin also relied
    on a letter from Mr. Sievert dated December 13, 1996, to Jack Hamilton of the
    respondent’s legal department. In the letter, Mr. Sievert confirms a telephone
    conversation with Mr. Hamilton wherein Mr. Hamilton advised that the respondent
    would be withdrawing the charges and that there was no need for Mr. Irwin to
    appear in court. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Part III: Previous Decisions</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>(i) Decision of the Justice of the Peace</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>At trial, the
    respondent took the position, as it does here, that Mr. Irwin’s defence that he
    had complied with the 2013 Orders was unavailable because it amounted to a
    collateral attack on those orders’ validity. According to the respondent,
    because Mr. Irwin did not avail himself of his right of appeal under s. 25 of
    the <em>Act</em>, his only available defences were that he either obtained a
    permit after the 2013 Orders were issued or removed the offending structures.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The justice of the
    peace rejected the respondent’s collateral attack submission. She distinguished
    the jurisprudence relied upon by the respondent, including <em>R. v.
    Consolidated Maybrun Mines Ltd.</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 706, <em>York (Regional
    Municipality) v. Martin Grove Properties Ltd.</em>, [2015] O.J. No. 6952, leave
    to appeal refused, [2016] OJ No 1582 (Ont. C.A.), and <em>Mississauga (City) v.
    Ashley Development Ltd.</em>, 2017 ONCJ 557, on the basis that those cases all
    involved situations where the defendants attacked the validity of the relevant
    order, while in the present case Mr. Irwin’s defence was that he complied with
    the 2013 Orders. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Having rejected the
    collateral rule as inapplicable, the justice of the peace went on to make
    several factual findings regarding the building permits. First, she found that
    the renovations and alterations referred to in the 2013 Orders were completed
    prior to 1996. Second, she found that the respondent was aware of the
    construction in issue in 1996. Third, she found that the appellant submitted
    prior applications for building permits and the requested site plan in 1996.
    Fourth, she found that shortly after these documents were filed, the respondent
    withdrew the charges. In addition, the justice of the peace relied on an
    application for a building permit and a corresponding permit issued by the
    respondent to Mr. Irwin for an unrelated matter. It showed that the number
    stamped on the bottom of the application was the same number that appears on a
    permit as the permit number.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The justice of the
    peace concluded that for buildings numbered 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, &quot;there may
    have been building permits issued as the number stamped at the bottom of the
    applications for permits in 1996 can be inferred as a permit number based on
    the process that appears to be in place with the City of Vaughan.” Accordingly,
    the justice of the peace was not satisfied that the respondent had proven its
    case beyond a reasonable doubt and acquitted Mr. Irwin of the charges related
    to those buildings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Regarding the charge
    related to building 3, which consists of three portable storage sheds that are
    each approximately 100 square feet with no plumbing, Mr. Irwin was also
    acquitted. The justice of the peace concluded that no building permit was
    required because building 3 did not fall within the definition of “building”
    under the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA
style='color:windowtext'>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> She did not specifically consider the charge related to building 4 in her
    reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>(ii) Ontario Court of Justice</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The appeal judge
    identified the application of the collateral attack rule as a critical issue to

    he concluded that the Superior Court was the proper venue for challenging the
    validity of the 2013 Orders.  He also found that Mr. Irwin’s position at trial
    “was plainly a collateral attack on the 2013 Orders”, as Mr. Irwin remained
    silent on the topic of the validity of the 2013 Orders until enforcement
    proceedings began.  The appeal judge further held that “by acceding to the
    defence that Mr. Irwin did not have to comply with the 2013 Orders because of
    actions taken in 1996 she [the justice of the peace] fell into reversible
    error.”  </span></p>

    regarding the collateral attack rule is well established. Generally, a
    collateral attack is defined as an attack on an order “made in proceedings
    other than those whose specific object is the reversal, variation, or nullification
    of the order”: <em>Wilson v. The Queen</em>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, at p. 599.

    v Litchfield</em>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 333 349. Caldwell J.A. writing for the
    Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, succinctly summarized the rule this way: “In
    practical terms, the common law rule prevents a person charged with violating a
    court order from saying, in his or her defence to that charge, that the order
    is invalid or unlawful”: <em>R. v Envirogun Ltd.</em>, 2018 SKCA 8, 3 W.W.R.

    law on the collateral attack rule focussed on collateral attacks of court
    orders, the Supreme Court developed a distinct analytical approach when
    considering the collateral attack of administrative orders. For such orders,
    the tension animating the rule is between ensuring that the legislature’s
    decision to assign decision-making powers to administrative bodies is not
    undermined and that individuals have an effective means available to them to
    challenge administrative orders: <em>Maybrun</em> at para. 44, and <em>Bird</em>,
    at paras. 25-26. </span></p>

    also identified two important policy rationales that support the rule’s
    application to administrative orders. First, permitting parties to ignore
    established procedures for challenging an order would risk discrediting
    administrative bodies’ authority and thereby undermine their effectiveness.
    Second, if collateral attacks are allowed, the state will have to resort to
    criminal charges and sanctions to secure compliance: <em>Maybrun</em>, at para.
    42; <em>Bird</em>, at paras. 27-28. </span></p>

    the Supreme Court directed that the analytical focus should be on whether the
    legislature intended to permit collateral attacks on the order, or intended
    instead that a party must challenge the order through other review mechanisms.
    The court listed five non-exhaustive factors that may be considered in
    determining the intent of the legislature for challenging the validity of an
    administrative order: (1) the wording of the statute under the authority of
    which the order was issued; (2) the purpose of the legislation; (3) the
    existence of a right of appeal; (4) the kind of collateral attack in light of
    the expertise or raison d’être of the administrative appeal tribunal; and (5)
    the penalty on a conviction for failing to comply with the order: <em>Maybrun</em>,
    at paras. 45-51. These factors “are not independent and absolute criteria, but
    important clues, among others, for determining the legislature’s intention”: <em>Maybrun</em>,
    at para. 46. </span></p>

    collateral attack rule is for the integrity of the administration of justice,
    it is not absolute. This court has recognized that because the rule was
    developed to advance the ends of justice, it should not be mechanically applied
    when court orders are attacked where doing so would result in an injustice: <em>Amtim
    Capital Inc. v. Appliance Recycling Centers of America</em>, 2014 ONCA 62, 118

    attacks on court orders offend the rule’s underlying principles, and the court
    has the discretion not to apply it in those circumstances. For example, in <em>R.
    v. Domm</em>, (1996) 31 O.R. (3d) 540 (C.A.), the question was whether an
    accused charged with breach of a court order banning publication of a criminal
    proceeding could challenge the validity of that order on non-jurisdictional
    grounds. In his analysis, Doherty J.A., at pp.17-18, made the following
    comments, which reflect the flexibility of the rule and the inherent discretion
    judges have in choosing whether to apply it:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The rule against collateral attack on court
    orders serves to reinforce the compliance component of the rule of law and
    enhance the repute of the administration of justice by providing for the
    orderly and functional administration of justice: <em>R. v. Litchfield</em>, <em>supra</em>,
    at pp.110-111. If a collateral attack on an order can be taken without harm to
    those interests, then the rule should be relaxed. Review by a trial judge of
    orders made on pre-trial motions provides an example of a situation in which
    those interests are not harmed by collateral attack: <em>Litchfield</em>, <em>supra</em>,

    of justice. As David J. Mullan notes, in the context of attacks on
    administrative orders, “when there is an adequate alternative remedy, the
    Canadian position on collateral attack is more in the nature of a rule than a

    v. C.U.P.E.</em>, Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, the court was
    concerned with a situation where an employee, who worked as a recreation
    instructor for the respondent, was convicted of sexually assaulting a boy under
    his supervision.  The employee was subsequently dismissed from his job, and the
    dismissal was the subject of a labour arbitration proceeding.  The arbitrator
    ruled that the criminal conviction was admissible as prima facie evidence that
    the employee had sexually assaulted the boy. However, the arbitrator found that
    the presumption raised by the criminal conviction had been rebutted. Thus, the
    employee had been dismissed without cause. The Ontario Divisional Court quashed
    that decision, and an appeal to this court was unsuccessful.</span></p>

    the Supreme Court, Arbour J. found that the appeal should be dismissed on the
    basis that the effective relitigation of the employee’s criminal conviction
    before the labour arbitrator amounted to an abuse of process. She rejected the
    applicability of the collateral attack rule in this context. Her reasons for
    doing so were as follows, at paras. 33-34:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>… Thus, in <em>Wilson</em>, <em>supra</em>,
    the Court held that an inferior court judge was without jurisdiction to pass on
    the validity of a wiretap authorized by a superior court.  Other cases that
    form the basis for this rule similarly involve attempts to overturn decisions
    in other fora, and not simply to relitigate their facts.  In <em>R. v. Sarson</em>,
    [1996] 2 S.C.R. 223, at para. 35, this Court held that a prisoner's habeas
    corpus attack on a conviction under a law later declared unconstitutional must
    fail under the rule against collateral attack because the prisoner was no
    longer &quot;in the system&quot; and because he was &quot;in custody pursuant
    to the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.&quot; Similarly, in <em>R.
    v. Consolidated Maybrun Mines Ltd.</em>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 706, this Court held
    that a mine owner who had chosen to ignore an administrative appeals process
    for a pollution fine was barred from contesting the validity of that fine in
    court because the legislation directed appeals to an appellate administrative
    body, not to the courts.  Binnie J. described the rule against collateral
    attack in <em>Danyluk</em>, <em>supra</em>, at para. 20, as follows: “that a <em>judicial</em> order pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction should not be brought
    into question in subsequent proceedings except those provided by law for the
    express purpose of attacking it” (emphasis added).</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Each of these cases concerns the appropriate
    forum for collateral attacks upon the judgment itself.  However, in the case at
    bar, the union does not seek to overturn the sexual abuse conviction itself,
    but simply contest, for the purposes of a different claim with different legal
    consequences, whether the conviction was correct.  It is an implicit attack on
    the correctness of the factual basis of the decision, not a contest about
    whether that decision has legal force, as clearly it does.  Prohibited
    “collateral attacks” are abuses of the court’s process.  However, in light of
    the focus of the collateral attack rule on attacking the order itself and its
    legal effect, I believe that the better approach here is to go directly to the
    doctrine of abuse of process.</span></p>

    significance is that it instructs that before considering whether a collateral
    attack is permissible, the court should first review the defence or legal

    Court cases are also of note. In Garland, the respondent gas utility, whose
    rates and payment policies are governed by the Ontario Energy Board, charged a
    penalty for late bill payments.  The appellant commenced a class action seeking
    restitution for unjust enrichment for the respondent’s charges on the basis
    that they violated the criminal rate of interest provisions in the Criminal
    Code. The motion judge granted the respondent’s motion for summary judgment,
    finding that the action was a collateral attack on the Board's orders.  The
    Court of Appeal disagreed but dismissed the appeal because the unjust
    enrichment claim could not be made out. The Supreme Court concluded that the
    collateral attack rule was inapplicable, reasoning, at para. 71:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Based on a plain reading of this rule, the
    doctrine of collateral attack does not apply in this case because here the
    specific object of the appellant’s action is not to invalidate or render

    collected by the respondent as a result of Board orders. Consequently, the

    arbitration where CUPE sought to challenge the underlying facts of a conviction
    of one of its members for sexual assault. Arbour J. reasoned that the Union's
    argument was &quot;an implicit attack on the correctness of the factual basis

    clearly it does&quot; (para. 34)</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>TeleZone is not attempting to nullify or set
    aside the Minister's order. Its case is that the Minister, in deciding not to

    Minister's decision should be quashed. On the contrary, TeleZone's causes of
    action in contract, tort and equity are predicated on the finality of that
    decision excluding TeleZone from participation in the telecommunications
    market, thereby (it says) causing it financial loss. Nor does TeleZone seek to
    deprive the Minister's decision of any legal effect. It does not challenge the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The defence position at trial was plainly a
    collateral attack on the 2013 Orders. Mr. Irwin argued that those Orders were
    of no force or effect because of steps taken some 17 years previously. He
    remained silent on the topic of the validity of the 2013 Orders until
    enforcement proceedings began. That is a collateral attack.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I pause in the analysis to observe that the
    2013 Orders, on their face, <em>replaced </em>the 1996 Orders. Each of the 2013
    Orders stipulates that on its face. The Respondent therefore took the position
    at trial that he complied with an Order which had been replaced. By acceding to
    that argument Her Worship erred in law. Mr. Irwin had an appeal route available
    to him to seek judicial review of the validity of the 2013 Orders or their
    scope. He did not do that. By acceding to the defence that Mr. Irwin did not
    have to comply with the 2013 Orders because of actions taken in 1996 she fell
    into reversible error. That finding must be quashed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>On this appeal, the
    respondent submits that the appeal judge was correct in his analysis as
    implicit in the defence argument was that the 2013 Orders were invalid because
    they were made at a time when building permits were extant.  Therefore, this
    was an attack on the validity of the 2013 Orders and thus qualified as a
    collateral attack.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>I recognize that an
    argument can be made that by taking the position that he had complied with the
    2013 Orders before they were issued, Mr. Irwin was implicitly challenging the
    orders’ underlying basis. In my view, this argument is misguided because it
    fails to consider the result that the defence was trying to achieve. The
    argument was not advanced to demonstrate that the 2013 Orders were invalid.
    Instead, it was made as part of a defence that Mr. Irwin had complied with
    those orders.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>It is important to keep
    in mind the specific requirements of the 2013 Orders. The orders directed Mr.
    Irwin to “Obtain the required building permit or remove the unauthorized
    construction and restore the building/property to its former state.” For buildings
    1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, Mr. Irwin did not argue that these orders should never have
    been issued and therefore had no legal force. Nor did he argue, for example,
    that these buildings did not need a building permit. Rather, his defence was
    that he complied with the precise requirements and demands of the orders. In
    other words, he had the required building permits. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Many defences may be
    characterized as an implicit attack on the validity of an order because they
    may call into question some aspect of the order. However, courts should resist
    automatically characterizing these arguments as collateral attacks. Instead,
    courts should concentrate on the substance of the defence to determine whether
    it actually attacks the validity of the order and its legal effect. For example,
    in <em>Toronto</em>, Arbour J. recognized that the union’s position was an
    implicit attack on the correctness of the decision’s factual basis. Yet, she
    found that it was not a collateral attack because it did not attack the order
    itself and its legal effect.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The same reasoning
    applies here. Mr. Irwin’s argument that he, in fact, had the permits demanded
    by the orders is “an implicit attack on the correctness of the factual basis of
    the [order] not a contest about whether that [order] has legal force”: <em>Toronto</em>,
    at para. 34.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>For these reasons, I
    would find that the defence regarding buildings numbered 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 were
    not collateral attacks.  Accordingly, it is unnecessary to undertake the <em>Maybrun</em> analysis concerning these convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>I also see no error in
    the justice of the peace’s conclusion that the respondent had not proved Mr.
    Irwin’s guilt with regard to the convictions related to buildings numbered 1,
    2, 5, 6 and 7. That finding was open to her on the record, which raised a reasonable
    doubt about whether permits had been issued for those buildings.</span></p>
  <p class=LHeading11><span lang=EN-CA>(ii) Buildings 3 and 4</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>There remain the
    convictions related to buildings 3 and 4. Building 3 consists of three portable
    storage sheds. Mr. Irwin testified that they are &quot;about a hundred square
    feet each,&quot; have no plumbing, and “there is a space between one of them.”
    Building 4 is used for boat storage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>Unlike the other
    buildings, Mr. Irwin did not claim to have permits for these buildings.
    Instead, his position at trial was that no building permits were required for
    these structures. Mr. Irwin's testimony and position at trial were summarized
    by his counsel during closing submissions as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Irwin’s evidence is that he applied for
    and building permits were issued with respect to five of the seven – five of
    the buildings on the property and that two structures did not receive
    application or permits. Structures that the evidence in terms of the
    applications was put in before you and Mr. Irwin’s position that permits were
    issued are with respect to buildings one, two, five, six and seven. The
    evidence with respect to building three, Your Worship, you’ll recall those were
    the three storage containers of less than 100 square feet with gaps between
    them, that was the evidence and that there is no plumbing in the – in that
    building. I’ve taken an extract, an excerpt, from the building code…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>None of this applies to that structure which
    is being identified on the orders to comply as building three. So we do submit
    that there should be – that there is no requirement for compliance because no
    building permit is required. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The fourth structure, building four as it’s
    identified in the order to comply, is made up of two industrial trailers and a
    storage rack for boats, a boat rack. That certainly doesn’t sound like a
    building to me.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>I am of the view that
    the defence for buildings three and four is of a different nature than the
    defence advanced regarding the other buildings such that it qualifies as a
    collateral attack. In effect, Mr. Irwin’s defence is that these orders should
    have never been issued. This is a collateral attack, as it seeks to invalidate
    the building inspector’s orders in a proceeding whose specific object is not
    the reversal, variation, or nullification of the order: <em>Wilson</em>, at p.
    599; <em>Garland</em>, at para. 71. Accordingly, the next question is whether
    the legislature intended to permit this type of a collateral attack. </span></p>

    rule on the validity of an administrative order attacked collaterally in penal
    proceedings. As noted above, they are: (1) the wording of the statute under the
    authority of which the order was issued; (2) the purpose of the legislation;
    (3) the existence of a right of appeal; (4) the kind of collateral attack in
    light of the expertise or raison d’être of the administrative appeal tribunal;
    and (5) the penalty on a conviction for failing to comply with the order: <em>Maybrun</em>,

    were issued pursuant to s. 12(2) of the <em>Act</em>. This section states that: </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>12 (2) An inspector who finds a
    contravention of this Act or the building code may make an order directing

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>8(1) No person shall construct or demolish

    precisely in s.1(1) of the <em>Act</em>. It means: </span></p>

    them or a structural system serving the function thereof including all

    weighs in favour of permitting collateral attacks in situations like Mr.
    Irwin’s. The statute indicates that inspectors can only issue orders like those
    under review here in very circumscribed situations: when the impugned structure
    meets the definition of “building” in the <em>Act</em>. The inspector has no
    discretion when applying these sections, nor is there any need to weigh broad
    policy goals. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>This makes this
    statutory scheme distinct from others like the one considered in <em>Bird</em>,
    where the Parole Board was empowered to impose conditions that it considered
    reasonable and necessary in order to protect society and facilitate successful
    reintegration. The fact that an inspector is required to simply apply a
    statutory scheme, which any court is capable of interpreting, does not suggest
    that the legislature sought to insulate an inspector against collateral
    attacks.  </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>Purpose of the </span></span><span
class=EmphasisUnderlineChar><span lang=EN-CA>Act</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>The Act’s purpose is to
    regulate building activity in Ontario and ensure that uniform standards of
    construction safety are imposed and enforced: <em>Ingles v. Tutaluk
    Construction Ltd</em>, 2000 SCC 12, [2000] 1 S.C.R., 298, at para. 23. Building
    permits serve this purpose. Permits are only issued if the building conforms
    with the <em>Act</em>, the building code, and other applicable laws: ss.8(2).
    While other sections of the <em>Act</em> empower inspectors to make emergency
    orders to deal with unsafe buildings (s.15.10), the building permit scheme can
    be seen as preventative in nature; permits ensure that buildings are
    constructed to code, so they do not endanger the public in the future. In my
    view, the laudable safety goals underlying the <em>Act</em> would be undermined
    if individuals could challenge orders to obtain a permit during penal
    proceedings by arguing that no permit is required. Individuals like Mr. Irwin
    may have a good faith but erroneous belief that no permit is required. If this
    issue is routinely resolved in penal proceedings, dangerous structures may
    exist on a property for years. It is in the interests of all involved,
    including the public who may be exposed to these structures, to resolve these
    questions expeditiously. An appeal under s.25 is the most expeditious route for
    resolving this dispute. Accordingly, this factor weighs against allowing a
    collateral attack in a penal proceeding. </span></p>

    provides for a broad right to appeal an order to the Superior Court. While this
    weighs against permitting a collateral attack on the order, the court in <em>Maybrun</em> stressed that the existence of a right to appeal “cannot be decisive in
    itself”: <em>Maybrun</em>, at para. 34. </span></p>

    the attack on an order requires considering factors that fall within an
    administrative appeal tribunal's specific expertise. Where an attack on an
    order is based on considerations that fall outside of the appeal tribunal’s
    expertise, this suggests that the legislature did not intend to give an appeal
    tribunal exclusive authority to rule on the order: <em>Maybrun</em>, at para.
    50</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:windowtext'>This factor weighs in
    favour of allowing the collateral attack. An appeal under s.25 of the <em>Act</em> lies to the Superior Court, not a specialized administrative tribunal. There is
    no reason to believe that the Superior Court has particular expertise in
    interpreting the <em>Act</em> relative to a penal Court. </span></p>

    While the maximum fine for an individual for a first offence is $50,000 and
    $100,000 for a subsequent offence, there is no minimum fine, nor is there any

    Irwin engaged in an impermissible collateral attack on the orders relating to
    buildings 3 and 4. While some factors suggest that an attack is permissible, I
    view the purpose of the <em>Act</em> and readily available appeal mechanisms as
    the decisive factors. The <em>Act</em>’s safety goals would be undercut if
    individuals could wait for penal proceedings to determine whether a building
    permit is required. By setting up a broad appeal mechanism, which must be
    exercised within 20 days of the order, the legislature signalled that
    expediency is a priority. Permitting collateral attacks of the type Mr. Irwin
    is making in this case would undermine this design, and is therefore contrary
    to legislative intent.</span></p>
