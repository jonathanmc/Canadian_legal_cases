  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Harvison Young J.A.: </span></strong></p>
  <h1><strong><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></strong><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Overview </span></strong></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Jason Smith, was convicted of
    sexual assault and sentenced to three years imprisonment as a result of the
    following incident. He appeals his conviction on a number of grounds, including
    that the trial judge erred in his <em>W.(D.)</em> analysis: <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742</span></em>. At the conclusion
    of the hearing, we allowed the appeal with reasons to follow. These are those
    reasons.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Facts</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant, A.W., was walking home from the
    transit station on a cold, wintry night around 10:30 p.m. She sensed someone
    following her and shortly after that, the appellant grabbed her from behind in
    what she described as a bear hug. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At this point, their stories diverge. The
    complainant testified that the appellant tried to get her pants off and touched
    her between her legs and on her vagina, over her clothing. She denied that this
    touching was consistent with the appellant simply trying to get up after they
    had fallen. She struggled against him, screamed, put her gloved hand in the
    appellant’s mouth, and yanked her hand down as hard as she could. The
    appellant’s DNA was found on her glove. The complainant estimated that they
    spent around 45 seconds to two minutes on the ground. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant said he thought the complainant
    was his girlfriend. They had planned to meet but he was late because he had
    been having drinks with some friends. He knew she would be annoyed. He could
    not find her at the location they agreed to meet. He went looking for her and,
    while walking, he noticed a woman walking about 40 to 50 feet ahead of him. He
    testified that he believed this woman was his girlfriend. He went up to her and
    hugged her from behind, slipped, and fell on top of her. He testified that he
    used his hands to lift himself up. He denied that he had touched her sexually
    as she claimed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was common ground that the entire incident
    took place over a relatively short period of time. When they got up, the
    complainant slapped the appellant and they both expressed words to the effect
    of “what the fuck?”. She asked where her purse was and the appellant pointed to
    a spot nearby. The appellant walked away, and the complainant immediately
    called 911.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the course of the three-day trial, the
    appellant’s girlfriend testified that they were supposed to meet that evening.
    She was angry because he was late and went home to the apartment where she
    lived with the appellant’s mother. She stated that the route she took to get to
    the bus stop to get home took her along the same route as A.W. walked that
    night. She also testified that when she was upset or angry at him, the
    appellant would sometimes hug her from behind. She was approximately the same
    height as the complainant at the time and had a knee-length coat that was
    similar to that worn by the complainant. They both had straight black hair that
    was of a similar length. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s reasons</span></h2>

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence.
    He determined that the appellant’s credibility was undermined by a number of
    factors, including:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that his estimate of the time and details of his
    unanswered phone calls to his girlfriend failed to match his girlfriend’s
    testimony; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that he had a poor recollection of minor points,
    including his girlfriend’s bus route to work;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that his consumption of alcohol may have
    contributed to his faulty memory; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that he did not call out to the woman he was
    following to confirm her identity; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>that he failed to apologize or help the woman
    after he realized she was not his girlfriend and he did not stay at the scene. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For those reasons, the trial judge did not
    accept the appellant’s arguments. He also found that this evidence did not
    raise a reasonable doubt. Finally, he determined that the Crown had satisfied
    its burden to prove each element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge accepted the complainant’s
    evidence that she was attacked from behind and that the appellant touched her
    inner thigh and against her vagina over her clothing. He said that her evidence
    was clear and consistent and that she immediately reported the incident to the
    police. Finally, he accepted her evidence that there was a struggle, as
    evidenced by the DNA found on the complainant’s glove.</span></p>

    evidence potentially confirmed the appellant’s version of events and, in

    the evidence as a whole establishes the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt. The respondent argues that the trial judge did that in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons, the trial judge correctly
    directed himself on the <em>W.(D.)</em> test. He concluded, after considering
    “all the evidence”, that the Crown had proven its case against the appellant
    beyond a reasonable doubt. However, his credibility assessment was not
    responsive to the evidence as a whole in this case.The First Step of <em>W.(D).</em></span></p>

    a methodology for triers of fact that is intended to focus their attention on
    the analytical steps that must be taken in assessing the evidence in order to
    ensure that the trier of fact considers whether the evidence as a whole proves
    the accused’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s application of <em>W.(D.)</em> was problematic in a number of respects. Beginning with the first step, he
    stated that he did not believe the appellant and that the appellant’s denial of
    sexual contact was undermined in a number of respects. However, several of the factors
    he identified (as listed above) seem to corroborate rather than undermine the
    appellant’s version of events. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For example, the first factor the trial judge
    mentioned was the appellant’s claim that he mistook the complainant for his
    girlfriend, and the trial judge noted at that point that “I do logically
    conclude that [the complainant and the girlfriend] would appear somewhat
    similar in appearance from behind”. In another bullet point, the trial judge
    specifically noted that the appellant’s consumption of alcohol “left him
    feeling ‘a little bit tipsy’ [which] may explain his faulty recollection of
    events as the evening progressed”. The trial judge did not, however, explain
    how these points “undermine” the appellant’s version of events. The similar
    appearance of the two women seems to bolster the likelihood that the appellant
    was simply mistaken. This might have been further reinforced by the fact (as
    accepted by the trial judge) that the appellant’s tipsiness at the time might
    have helped to explain why he failed to recognize that the woman in front of
    him was not his girlfriend, especially given their similar appearance and dress
    viewed from behind. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also noted that the appellant
    was aware that he was late to meet his girlfriend and was walking the route he
    knew she would likely take to get home but didn’t call out to her. However, the
    appellant testified that his intention was to surprise her by hugging her from
    behind, because she was upset that he was late. His girlfriend testified that
    the appellant would hug her from behind when she was upset. Given that
    evidence, his failure to call out to her before approaching A.W. was not
    necessarily a fact that would tend to undermine his story. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Similarly, the trial judge stated that the
    appellant’s lack of apology to the complainant after they got up from the
    ground undermined his story that he mistook the complainant for his girlfriend.
    It seems the trial judge placed some emphasis on this fact. Later in his
    reasons, he wrote: “[i]mportantly, in cross-examination, Jason Smith admitted
    that after getting up from being on top of AW and realizing she was not his
    girlfriend, he did not say that he was sorry. He did not explain he thought AW
    was his girlfriend.” During cross-examination the appellant testified that he
    thought he said he was sorry and said that he didn’t do anything. He also
    testified that the events happened very quickly and that he might have been
    mumbling when he apologized. His testimony during cross-examination, that he
    attempted to apologize but might have mumbled, was not something that would necessarily
    tend to undermine his story.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In short, listing these factors and stating that
    he does not accept the evidence does not explain why the trial judge rejected
    the appellant’s evidence. Although the trial judge recited a number of factors
    he considered when assessing credibility, it is unclear how these factors
    affected his credibility assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In applying <em>W.(D.)</em>, the trial judge also must consider
    whether any of the evidence at the trial raises a reasonable doubt. <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>It is not clear from the trial judge’s reasons that
    he was alive to this. </span></em>On the first step of <em>W.(D.)</em>, he did
    not consider whether he believed the appellant’s girlfriend’s evidence and he
    did not consider whether it raised a reasonable doubt. This evidence is
    discussed in greater detail below.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the second step of the <em>W.(D.)</em> test,
    the trial judge was very brief in his discussion, stating at para. 58: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Having reached this conclusion, the next part
    is to address whether a reasonable doubt has been raised based on Jason Smith's
    evidence. For the reasons stated above, I conclude that I do not have a
    reasonable doubt. His evidence about what occurred after he wrapped his arms
    around AW and when they were both standing again is neither credible nor does
    it raise a reasonable doubt. In saying that, I am totally mindful that the
    burden of proof is entirely upon the Crown to prove the commission of this
    offence beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no burden whatsoever on the
    accused at any time in this criminal case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the outset, the initial problem with the trial
    judge’s consideration of the second step flows from the first step. The factors
    cited by the trial judge to which I have referred above may well have raised a
    reasonable doubt even if the trial judge did not accept his evidence. Given his
    recognition that there were some possible explanations, it was incumbent on the
    trial judge to explain why these factors did not raise a reasonable doubt
    beyond saying simply that he didn’t accept the appellant’s evidence and that it
    did not raise a reasonable doubt. In short, the trial judge’s reasons are
    merely conclusory.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second step of <em>W.(D.)</em> is admittedly
    difficult to apply. The central flaw in the trial judge’s application of <em>W.(D.)</em> was his failure to consider whether the appellant’s girlfriend’s evidence gave
    rise to a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>In referring to the second step of </span></em><em>W.(D.)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, the trial judge referred only to the appellant’s
    testimony and not to any of the other evidence or, in particular, to his
    girlfriend’s evidence.</span></em> Although the trial judge set out her
    evidence at the beginning of his reasons, there is no discussion or analysis of
    whether he accepted some, all, or none of it, and whether it left him in a
    reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although she was not a witness to the alleged
    assault, the appellant’s girlfriend’s evidence was relevant to the appellant’s
    credibility. She testified that they planned to meet that night, near the
    location where the appellant saw A.W.; she and A.W. had similar looking winter
    coats; she had similar hair and was around the same height as A.W.; and she
    said that the appellant would hug her from behind when she was upset. This
    evidence was capable of confirming the appellant’s evidence and thus bolstering
    his credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Had the trial judge addressed this evidence in
    his reasons and explained why he accepted or rejected it, his findings would
    have attracted deference from this court. In the absence of any discussion,
    however, there is no way to know whether the trial judge was alive to the need
    to examine whether the girlfriend’s evidence gave rise to a reasonable doubt in
    the context of all the other evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor is there any reference to the fact that there
    were inconsistencies between the complainant’s police statement on the night of
    the incident and her evidence at trial. For example, at trial, A.W. testified
    that the appellant attempted to pull down her pants while they were on the
    ground. When challenged on this, A.W. testified that she was 70% sure that she
    told the police this in her statement. However, she did not volunteer that
    point. It was suggested to her by the interviewing officer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It would have been open to the trial judge to
    determine, after scrutinizing the complainant’s evidence, that the inconsistency
    between her police statement and her in-court testimony was not material. Trial
    judges are not required to address every inconsistency however minor in a
    witness’ evidence:<em> R. v. A.M.</em>, 2014 ONCA 769, 123 O.R. (3d) 536, at
    para. 14; <em>R. v. R.P.</em>, 2020 ONCA 637, at para. 21. However, the trial
    judge did not scrutinize or resolve this inconsistency, nor did he find that it
    was not material. </span></p>

    of mistaken identity and denied that he had touched A.W. sexually. There was
    potentially exculpatory circumstantial evidence that supported the appellant’s
    story that he was looking for his girlfriend in the area and that he approached
    the complainant mistakenly thinking she was his girlfriend. Some of the
    potentially exculpatory evidence was corroborated by the girlfriend’s testimony
    and was consistent with A.W.’s evidence. In these circumstances, the trial
    judge erred by not turning his mind to whether this evidence, which could have
    corroborated the appellant’s story, raised a reasonable doubt. This potentially

    case: see, e.g., <em>R. v. J.J.R.D.</em> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (Ont.
    C.A.). In <em>J.J.R.D.</em>, the key piece of defense evidence was the
    appellant’s testimony, which the trial judge totally rejected, despite the fact
    that it contained no obvious flaws. This court concluded that the trial judge’s
