  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.F. testified he was about six years old when
    the incident giving rise to the charges occurred. Together with his other
    evidence, this likely placed the events in the early summer of 2013. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant lived next door to J.F.'s
    grandparents. On an occasion when he was visiting his grandparents, J.F. went
    to the appellant's house with his Hot Wheels Collectors Catalogue intending to
    assess the value of a collection of toy cars at the house.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to J.F., he was sitting on the floor
    in an upstairs bedroom where the cars were located. The appellant came into the
    room, scooped him up, put him on the bed, pulled down his pants and underwear
    and then rubbed, licked and kissed J.F.'s penis. The incident lasted about two
    to three minutes. It ended abruptly when J.F.'s grandmother arrived at the appellant’s
    home and called J.F. downstairs. J.F. did not see the appellant again that day.
    And he did not discuss the cars with the appellant’s wife on that occasion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.F. testified that he did not immediately tell
    anyone about the incident because, some time previously, the appellant read him
    a book about monsters and whispered to J.F. that he could control monsters.
    J.F. said that scared him. When asked if anything else scared him, J.F.
    testified the assault may have happened twice. He was not sure, events had “blended
    together” into “one big blob”. If there was a second time, it was the same as
    the first time except he did not have his Hot Wheels Collectors Guide with him.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.F. disclosed the incident to his mother in
    March 2018 after similar allegations were made by the appellant's granddaughter
    and grandson, J.F.’s best friend. Those charges were ultimately withdrawn. J.F.
    knew that his mother was upset about the charges being withdrawn.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.F.'s grandmother, S.P., testified that B.F.
    had instructed her not to let J.F. go to the appellant's home alone when the
    appellant was present. S.P. recalled that, on one occasion during the summer,
    when J.F. was about six, she sent J.F. to the appellant's house while she
    finished baking a cake, believing the appellant was not there. However, when
    she went over to the house and called upstairs for J.F. to come home, to her
    surprise, the appellant came down the stairs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified and denied the
    allegations. He explained that he worked in the aircraft industry and traveled
    globally to provide aircraft engineering and other services in several sectors,
    including the U.S. military sector. When he traveled, he could be away for a
    long time, as much as a year or more. He said he had never been upstairs alone
    with J.F., and had never read him a book about monsters, or for that matter any
    other book. Indeed, he said that he had never read books to his own children. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination, the appellant was asked
    where he was working between 2011 and 2015. He said recently he had spent a lot
    of time in El Paso, Texas and San Marcos, Texas. When asked by the trial judge to
    focus on 2011 to 2015, he said those were the places where he was consistently.
    But he had also been to other places. When asked about duration, he said in
    2015 he spent over a year in El Paso. In response to the Crown’s suggestion
    that the timeline concerning when he was home between 2011 and 2015 was a
    little fuzzy, he responded that he would be in and out a lot, so he did not
    keep a record of time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant's wife, C.A., said J.F. came to
    their home unaccompanied around four times. She was home alone on those
    occasions and the appellant was not present. When asked during examination
    in-chief if the day S.P. was baking a cake provided her with any point of
    reference, C.A. said that could be the day J.F. was playing upstairs with her
    grandchildren.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, C.A. did recall a day when J.F. came
    over with his Hot Wheels Catalogue. She testified that happened once. When
    referred to the 2011 to 2015 timeframe in the indictment, she thought it would
    be closer to the 2014, 2015 years. C.A. testified that the appellant was not
    present on the occasion when J.F. came over with the Hot Wheels Catalogue. He
    was either in Texas or Wyoming or Ohio. Depending on the year, he could have
    been away anywhere from a year to six months.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.A. recalled that she was in the living room reading
    a book. While looking at the cars, J.F. came downstairs from time to time to
    tell her about the value of the cars. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination, C.A. confirmed that J.F.
    came over unaccompanied four times. She described the purpose of his visit on
    each occasion and clarified that she did not know about any day that S.P. was
    baking a cake. However, she agreed that the day J.F. came over with his Hot
    Wheels Catalogue was a memorable detail. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although C.A. initially testified that she
    thought the Hot Wheels visit happened in 2014 or 2015, she agreed J.F. would
    have been six in the summer of 2013. In response to the suggestion that she did
    not know where the appellant was when the alleged incident happened, she
    asserted that she knew where he was in 2013, 2014 and 2015. In 2013, he was in
    El Paso, Texas from May until the following May. After he came home, the couple
    separated for a while. In 2015, the appellant was in Wyoming from October until
    March 2016. C.A. reiterated that the appellant was not home on the day of the
    Hot Wheels visit.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge's reasons</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge focused the initial part of her
    analysis on J.F.’s testimony and the reliability and credibility of his
    evidence. During the course of that portion of her analysis, she considered the
    “[c]onflicting evidence regarding when J.F. was upstairs in [the appellant’s
    home]”. She noted that defence counsel had argued that J.F. said he was only at
    the appellant’s home with his Hot Wheels Catalogue on one occasion. She said if
    this were true and she was unable to reject C.A.’s evidence that the appellant
    was not home on that day, C.A.’s evidence may give rise to a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for C.A.’s evidence that the appellant was
    not home on the day that J.F. came over with his Hot Wheels Catalogue, the trial
    judge noted that J.F. did not say that the day the incident occurred was the </span><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>only</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> day he
    went over with his Catalogue. Further, J.F. said he did not show the
    appellant's wife the cars and the Catalogue on the day the offence occurred.
    Concerning this evidence, the trial judge concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I am not satisfied that C.A.’s evidence
    provides a reasonable doubt or definitively tells me what occurred on this
    particular occasion. It may be that she was talking about a different occasion,
    I cannot be certain. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In response to a defence argument that there was
    no opportunity for the appellant to read the book about monsters to J.F. and
    that the evidence was fabricated, the trial judge said she accepted J.F.’s
    “version of events as credible on this point.” She said she would return to the
    issue later in her reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although J.F. testified he was moderately
    confident that a second incident occurred, the trial judge was not satisfied
    that was the case. She noted that J.F. was certain that the first event
    occurred and was clear and articulate in his description of that event. She
    concluded that the fact that J.F. said there may have been a second incident
    that occurred in exactly the same fashion did not undermine his reliability and
    credibility in relation to the first incident. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, the trial judge found J.F. a
    credible witness. While she acknowledged some inconsistencies in his evidence
    in relation to other evidence, she found they related generally to peripheral
    matters such as timing and sequence and that the core details of his account
    were corroborated by the evidence of adult witnesses. She concluded he was both
    reliable and credible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After reaching this conclusion, the trial judge
    turned to the defence evidence. She identified some minor issues with that evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant gave an inaccurate answer to the
    police when he said no in response to a question whether J.F. came over to
    visit. However, his explanation that J.F. was not visiting him but rather his
    grandchildren was not unreasonable;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant's evidence about his work schedule
    and travel especially concerning the time of the alleged events was vague; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the defence evidence concerning where the
    appellant was working at the time of the alleged events was inconsistent, the
    appellant saying Texas, his wife, C.A., saying Wyoming.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge concluded her reasons with a section
    she titled “</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>W.(D.)</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> Analysis.”
    She began this analysis by saying:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The testimony of J.F. and [the appellant] are
    diametrically opposed. They cannot both be telling the truth.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She then stated that because the appellant called
    evidence, she was required to apply <em>W.(D.)</em></span><a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></span></a><span lang=EN-CA>. She
    began by noting that the appellant adamantly denied the allegations and that
    there was nothing more he could do or say in a case of this nature. However,
    she found herself in the same position as the trial judge in <em>J.J.R.D</em>.
    There was nothing in the substance of the appellant's evidence or in the manner
    in which he testified that would cause her to reject his evidence. Nonetheless,
    she said, </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>However, based on the totality of evidence
    which I do accept, I must reject it. </span><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-CA>It simply cannot be true.</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> I am
    entitled to take into account the strength of the Crown's case and reject [the
    appellant's] evidence based on a considered and reasoned acceptance of the
    conflicting evidence from the Crown's witnesses. This is a sufficient basis upon
    which to reject an accused's evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I therefore find the Crown has proven, beyond
    a reasonable doubt, [the offences]. [Emphasis added; citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Discussion</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We accept the appellant’s argument that the
    trial judge erred by approaching the conflicting evidence in this case as a
    credibility contest and failing to properly consider reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is noteworthy in our view, that the trial
    judge began her </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>W.(D.)</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> analysis by observing that the evidence of the appellant and J.F. was
    diametrically opposed and stating, “[t]hey both cannot be telling the truth”.
    Such a statement is the antithesis of a </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>W.(D.)</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> analysis, which requires the trier of fact to consider whether,
    even if she does not accept the defence evidence, she is still left with a
    reasonable doubt by it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not the task of a trier of fact to
    determine which of two versions of an event is true. Rather, the trier’s task
    is to determine whether the Crown has met its burden of proving the elements of
    an offence beyond a reasonable doubt. As Cory&nbsp;J. held at p. 757 of </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>W.(D.)</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is incorrect to instruct a jury in a
    criminal case that, in order to render a verdict, they must decide whether they
    believe the defence evidence or the Crown's evidence. Putting this either/or
    proposition to the jury excludes the third alternative; namely, that the jury,
    without believing the accused, after considering the accused's evidence in the
    context of the evidence as a whole, may still have a reasonable doubt as to his
    guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A finding that a complainant is both reliable
    and credible is not sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt. As noted by this court in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.
    J.W.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2014 ONCA 322, 316 O.A.C. 395, at para. 26: “a
    reasonable doubt can survive a finding that the complainant is credible.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, the trial judge purported to rely on </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>J.J.R.D.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> to support her rejection of
    the appellant’s evidence and to justify her finding that the Crown met its
    burden of proof. However, what the trial judge failed to do was consider
    whether the evidence, as a whole, raised a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nowhere in her </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>W.(D.)</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> analysis does the trial judge refer to reasonable doubt. In both
    the opening and concluding statements of her analysis, she refers to the fact
    that the two versions of the event (namely, that it happened and that it did
    not happen) cannot both be true. Although that may be accurate as far as it
    goes, it fails to address the fundamental issue of reasonable doubt or reflect
    an appreciation that what was at issue was not a credibility contest. Rather,
    it was whether the Crown had proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, although she referred to reasonable
    doubt elsewhere when she recognized the possibility that C.A.’s evidence could
    raise a reasonable doubt if J.F. had been to the house with his Hot Wheels
    Catalogue on only one occasion, the trial judge assessed the question whether
    C.A.’s evidence raised a  reasonable doubt in relation to only one aspect of
    the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Specifically, in closing submissions, defence
    counsel asserted that J.F. testified he went to the appellant’s house with his
    Hot Wheels Catalogue only once. In her reasons, the trial judge said she
    relistened to J.F.’s evidence and he did not make such a statement. However, in
    considering this issue, the trial judge did not refer to C.A.’s evidence that
    J.F. had been to her house with the Hot Wheels Catalogue on only one occasion. Had
    she considered that evidence, she would also have had to consider the lack of specific
    evidence from J.F. concerning how many times he had been to the house with his
    Hot Wheels Catalogue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also mistakenly concluded that
    the appellant’s evidence and C.A.’s evidence were inconsistent on the issue of
    where the appellant was when the offence was alleged to have occurred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge said the appellant was in Texas
    while C.A. said he was in Wyoming. However, that does not accurately reflect
    their evidence. On J.F.’s evidence, the offence most likely occurred in the
    summer of 2013. The appellant and C.A. both identified Texas as the appellant’s
    destination in 2013. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To invoke </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>J.J.R.D.</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, a trial judge must assess the whole of the evidence and reject the
    defence evidence based on a considered and reasoned acceptance of the Crown’s
    evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>An outright rejection of an accused's evidence
    based on a considered and reasoned acceptance beyond a reasonable doubt of the
    truth of conflicting credible evidence is as much an explanation for the
    rejection of an accused's evidence as is a rejection based on a problem
    identified with the way the accused testified or the substance of the accused's
    evidence: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>J.J.R.D.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at
    para. 53. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, we are not satisfied that the trial judge
    fulfilled the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>J.J.R.D.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> requirements. She failed to assess the whole of the evidence or to do so
    accurately in considering whether it was capable of raising a reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, we conclude that the trial judge
    approached the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>W.(D.)</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> analysis as a credibility contest rather than what it is: a method of assessing
