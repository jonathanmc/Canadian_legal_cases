  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This prosecution came out of a lengthy
    investigation focused on Adam Vickerson and Gavin Lambie. The Crown alleged Vickerson
    and Lambie operated a scheme in which they arranged for persons, often addicts,
    to use forged prescriptions to acquire Fentanyl patches. Vickerson created the
    forged prescriptions. Lambie recruited individuals who attempted to fill the forged
    prescriptions for Fentanyl patches at various pharmacies. The appellant was one
    of those individuals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lambie was initially charged with Vickerson, but
    pled guilty a few months before the trial and became the main Crown witness. By
    the time the case got before the jury, Vickerson and the appellant were the
    only remaining accused. Of the 20 counts that went to the jury, Vickerson was
    charged with 19. The appellant was charged with four.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the course of the trial, the Crown led evidence
    of 25 transactions in which different people, under the direction of Vickerson
    and Lambie, obtained or attempted to obtain Fentanyl patches using false
    prescriptions at pharmacies. The appellant had nothing to do with any of these
    transactions. The Crown also led evidence of two incidents in which the Crown alleged
    the appellant was involved in obtaining or attempting to obtain Fentanyl using
    forged prescriptions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to Lambie, the appellant, used a
    forged prescription in the name of Tracy Hunter to obtain 15 Fentanyl patches
    from a pharmacy on September 26, 2013. The appellants friend, Stephanie
    Goodfellow, testified the appellant sometimes used the name Tracy Hunter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lambie testified the appellant went into the
    pharmacy and came out with 15 Fentanyl patches, gave Lambie 10, and kept the
    other 5. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The doctor whose name appeared on the
    prescription testified he did not write the prescription and Tracy Hunter was
    not a patient of his. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury convicted the appellant on the charge
    of uttering the forged prescription. They were satisfied the appellant presented
    a forged prescription in the name of Tracy Hunter to the pharmacist. The jury
    acquitted the appellant on the related charge of possession of Fentanyl patches
    for the purposes of trafficking. This verdict indicates the jury was not
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the appellant was actually able to fill the
    forged prescription and deliver the Fentanyl patches to Lambie. The jurys acquittal
    finds support in the absence of any documentation in the pharmacys records pertaining
    to the dispensing of Fentanyl patches to Tracy Hunter on September 26, 2013.
    In the normal course of the pharmacys business, that documentation should have
    been in the records if Fentanyl patches were actually sold to Tracy Hunter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second incident involving the appellant
    occurred on September 30, 2013. According to Stephanie Goodfellow, the
    appellant asked her to take a prescription for Fentanyl to the pharmacy and
    have it filled for the appellant. The appellant asked Ms. Goodfellow to use a
    forged prescription in Ms. Goodfellows name to obtain the drugs for the
    appellants terminally ill father. The appellant made up a story explaining why
    she could not legitimately obtain the prescription herself. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Goodfellow agreed to help her friend out.
    She attempted to fill the prescription, but when the pharmacist questioned the legitimacy
    of the prescription, Ms. Goodfellow panicked and left without obtaining the
    drugs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The doctor whose name appeared on the
    prescription testified Stephanie Goodfellow had never been a patient of his and
    he had not written a prescription.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lambie testified he knew the appellant found someone
    willing to fill a forged prescription. She had provided Ms. Goodfellows health
    card number to Lambie. Vickerson prepared the forged prescription in Ms.
    Goodfellows name. Lambie knew the prescription was not filled because Ms.
    Goodfellow had become frightened and left the pharmacy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury convicted the appellant of uttering a
    forged prescription in the name of Ms. Goodfellow.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Count 3 charged the appellant alone with
    possession of property obtained by crime. This offence had no connection to the
    forged prescription scheme giving rise to the other 19 counts in the indictment. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the police arrested the appellant at her
    home, they found a box of documents in a closet in her bedroom. The documents belonged
    to her employer, Dr. Liquornik, and included referral letters from other
    physicians and patient test results. Some patients were identified by name. The
    documents were no longer part of Dr. Liquorniks active patient files and
    would, in the normal course, have been shredded.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Liquornik explained the documents were
    supposed to be shredded in the office. Although no one had permission to remove
    the documents from his office, Dr. Liquornik was aware that, on occasion, his
    employees took documents for shredding to the hospital where the documents
    could be destroyed much more quickly using the equipment there. Dr. Liquornik was
    not asked whether he was aware of any employees who took these documents to
    their home. He was also not asked whether it was any part of the appellants
    duties to shred documents at the office. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not testify. On the evidence, she
    was clearly in possession of the documents found in her closet. The Crown
    alleged she had stolen them from her employer. The Crown did not suggest a
    motive and did not contend the documents had any connection to the forged
    prescription scheme. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants trial counsel argued the
    appellant may have taken the documents from her employers office under the
    mistaken belief she was permitted to take those documents to the hospital to
    shred them. Counsel further argued the appellant may have taken the documents
    to her home, intending to take them on to the hospital. Counsel submitted, if the
    jury accepted this explanation or had a doubt about it, the Crown had not
    proved the appellant acted fraudulently and without colour of right and she
    could not be convicted of theft: <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 322. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the alleged improper examination in-chief of the

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lambie had pled guilty before the appellants trial
    commenced. He had not been sentenced, although the Crown and Lambies counsel
    had agreed to a joint submission of six years with a very substantial deduction
    for pretrial custody and time spent on bail. Lambie signed a 20-page statutory
    declaration purporting to outline his involvement in the scheme and indicating
    he was prepared to testify for the Crown. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Early in Lambies examination in-chief, Crown
    counsel asked him whether he had received any benefit for testifying. Lambie
    said no. Crown counsel then reviewed the jail sentence Lambie would receive. Next,
    Crown counsel asked Lambie why he was testifying. Lambie indicated he was trying
    to change his life and do things the right way. He was now attending Narcotics Anonymous.
    The Crown asked whether there were any triggers to his decision to change his
    lifestyle. Lambie responded one of his best friends had died of a drug
    overdose. Crown counsel asked what drug had been involved and Lambie replied Fentanyl.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the appellant moved for a mistrial. He
    argued Crown counsels questioning was misleading and violated the rule prohibiting
    questions during examination in-chief designed exclusively to buttress the
    credibility of the witness. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed the motion for a
    mistrial: <em>R. v. Vickerson</em> <em>et al.</em>, 2017 ONSC 6168. On appeal,
    counsel renews the arguments rejected at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not necessary to explore the limits of the
    rule against oath-helping. In the circumstances of this case, there was
    absolutely no doubt Lambie would be cross-examined about his motives for
    pleading guilty and testifying, especially any benefit he may have received
    from the Crown in exchange for his testimony. In fact, Lambie was
    cross-examined at length about his deal with the Crown. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>If Crown counsel had not canvassed Lambies
    motives for pleading guilty and testifying during examination in-chief, Lambies
    cross-examination would inevitably have opened the door to the same questions by
    the Crown in reply. Given the centrality of Lambies motives for testifying to
    the defence, and the inevitability of that cross-examination, it is difficult
    to see how the appellant was prejudiced by the questions being put to Lambie
    in-chief, rather than in reply.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a matter of practice, Crown counsel should
    have outlined for the court his proposed line of questioning before he asked
    Lambie about his motives for testifying. Had he done so, the defence would have
    had an opportunity to put its position forward and the trial judge could have
    made a ruling setting the boundaries for the Crowns line of questioning. In
    different circumstances, some of the questions asked by Crown counsel may have been
    improper and undermined the fairness of the trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsels question, which elicited evidence
    that Lambies friend had died of a Fentanyl overdose, was unnecessary and
    potentially prejudicial. The Crown could have made Lambies reasons for
    testifying clear without identifying Fentanyl as the drug that had caused his
    friends death.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fortunately, the trial judge neutralized the
    potential prejudice when he told the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The fact that there are people in our society
    that are addicted to Fentanyl and have died by overdose of Fentanyl are facts
    that are irrelevant to your determination of whether the Crown has proved beyond
    a reasonable doubt the offences charges against  Tracy Fairbarn.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel for the appellant also argues, apart
    from any improper oath-helping, Crown counsels questions of Lambie created a
    misleading picture which could not be cured on cross-examination. Counsel contends,
    that by eliciting Lambies evidence he received no benefit for his testimony,
    Crown counsel improperly put evidence before the jury he knew to be inaccurate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel further submits the language used by the
    Crown in questioning Lambie about the sentence he was to receive misled the
    jury about the real length of the sentence Lambie would serve. Lastly, counsel
    argues the Crown erroneously told the jury Lambie had been sentenced when in
    fact he had not been sentenced before he testified.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We would not give effect to these arguments. Lambies
    evidence that he received no benefit for testifying was difficult to believe. The
    incredulity of the answer does not, however, mean the Crown asked a misleading
    question. Crown counsel could not dictate Lambies answer. If Lambie did not
    consider the sentence he received a benefit, his answer was a truthful one,
    regardless of how incredible that answer may have seemed to the jury. Lambies evidence
    he received no benefit, arguably inured to the benefit of the defence.
    Certainly, it provided a reason for the jury to conclude Lambie was lying in
    his evidence. At a minimum, the answer opened the door to fruitful
    cross-examination. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crowns description of the sentence to be
    imposed on Lambie was arguably incomplete in that it did not identify the
    actual amount of time Lambie would spend in jail. The defence
    cross-examination, however, corrected any possible misapprehension the jury may
    have been under.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel did mistakenly indicate on more
    than one occasion Lambie had been sentenced before he testified. When Crown
    counsels error was pointed out, the trial judge allowed Crown counsel to tell
    the jury he had been mistaken, and Lambie had, in fact, not been sentenced when
    he testified. This correction avoided any potential prejudice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In summary, the Crowns questions did not
    mislead the jury. The defence was able to fully cross-examine to clarify any inaccuracies
    or uncertainties. The cross-examination effectively revealed the apparent
    untruthfulness of some of Lambies answers. By the end of his testimony, the
    jury was well equipped to consider Lambies credibility. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We would not give effect to the first argument. The
    appellants defence on this charge required the jury have a reasonable doubt on
    two things. First, the jury had to have a doubt whether the appellant
    mistakenly believed she was authorized to remove the documents from her
    employers office. Second, the jury had to have a doubt whether she intended to
    take the documents found in her bedroom closet to the hospital for shredding. If
    the jury did not have a reasonable doubt on both factual questions, the
    appellants defence on this charge would fail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A defence based on a mistaken belief is
    difficult to make out when the accused does not testify. There was no evidence the
    appellant was aware people were taking documents from her employers office for
    shredding, and no evidence shredding documents was any part of the appellants
    duties. While her employers testimony provided an evidentiary basis for the
    defence advanced, the evidence in support of the defence was far from compelling.
    It cannot be said any reasonable jury, properly instructed, would have been
    left with a doubt about the appellants guilt. The verdict was not unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do, however, accept the appellants second

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge had a difficult task. He had to
    instruct the jury on 20 different charges. To assist the jury, he organized the
    counts by reference to offences that shared common elements, and he gave the
    jury written schedules summarizing the evidence on each of the specific counts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the format outlined above, the trial
    judge instructed the jury on a theft charge involving Vickerson only,
    immediately before he instructed the jury on the charge alleging the appellant
    was in possession of stolen medical records. The theft charge against Vickerson
    alleged he stole a prescription pad from a doctors office. His liability on
    that count turned entirely on whether he had taken the pad. If Vickerson took
    the prescription pad, he was guilty of theft. There was no other defence available.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When instructing the jury on the theft charge against
    Vickerson, the trial judge described all of the elements of the offence of
    theft, including the requirement that the taking be fraudulent and without
    colour of right. Neither of those elements of the offence were in issue on the
    theft charge against Vickerson.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the charge the appellant was in possession of
    stolen property, unlike the theft charge against Vickerson, the taking of the
    documents was not in issue. Again, unlike the theft charge against Vickerson,
    the appellants state of mind was central to whether she had committed theft
    and was in possession of stolen property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his instructions on the charge of possession
    of stolen property, the trial judge said nothing about the elements of the
    offence of theft, presumably because he had just reviewed those elements when
    instructing on the theft charge against Vickerson. The trial judge did not tell
    the jury that to convict it must conclude the appellants taking of the
    documents was done fraudulently and without colour of right. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The failure to instruct the jury on the meaning
    of the words fraudulently and without colour of right, and to relate those
    concepts to the evidence and the positions of the parties, was non-direction
    amounting to misdirection. It was particularly important the jury be told that
    an honest belief by the appellant she was authorized to take the documents from
    the doctors office and have possession of the documents at her home was a
    defence, even if the belief was mistaken. The jury could not properly determine
    the appellants guilt on this charge without those instructions. The conviction
    cannot stand.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant takes issue with two aspects of
    the jury instruction. First, she alleges various errors in relation to the <em>Vetrovec</em> instruction as it applied to Lambie. Second, the appellant submits the trial
    judge failed to adequately instruct the jury that each count in the multi-count
    indictment must be considered separately. The appellant argues the trial judge
    should have told the jury that evidence relating to the counts involving
    Vickerson only was inadmissible against the appellant and that the evidence on
    each of the two uttering forged document charges against the appellant had to
    be considered separately. The Crown had not argued that evidence on one count
    was admissible on the other count. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave a <em>Vetrovec</em> instruction in respect of several Crown witnesses who played various roles in
    the forged prescription scheme. We do not accept the reference to the other
    witnesses as <em>Vetrovec</em> witnesses necessarily watered down the
    instruction as it applied to Lambie. We do accept, however, Lambie should have
    been singled out for a more focused <em>Vetrovec</em> warning. On the evidence,
    there was very strong reason to believe Lambie had received a more lenient
    sentence in exchange for testifying in support of the Crowns case. He was a
    quintessential <em>Vetrovec</em> witness for that very reason. The trial judge
    should have highlighted this concern when explaining the dangers associated
    with relying on Lambies evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also should have distinguished between
    the appellant and Vickerson when outlining to the jury evidence that was
    capable of confirming Lambies evidence. In a trial involving more than one
    accused, evidence can be confirmatory of an accomplices evidence as against a
    specific accused, only if the potential confirmatory evidence is admissible
    against that accused: see <em>R. v. Perciballi</em> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 481
    (Ont. C.A.), aff, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 761. For example, evidence from a person
    involved in one of the forged prescription transactions that did not involve
    the appellant, and which tended to confirm Lambies evidence in respect of that
    transaction, could not confirm Lambies evidence as it related to the two
    transactions said to involve the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The shortcomings in the <em>Vetrovec</em> instruction were not fatal. The jurys verdicts indicate it understood the
    danger in relying on Lambies evidence alone. The jury acquitted the appellant
    on the charge of possession of Fentanyl for the purposes of trafficking. That
    charge depended entirely on Lambies evidence the appellant delivered the
    Fentanyl patches to her. The jury convicted on the related charge of uttering a
    forged document. There was confirmatory evidence on that charge from Ms.
    Goodfellow. The jury also convicted on the uttering charge involving the
    appellants attempt to have Ms. Goodfellow fill a forged prescription. Lambie
    did give evidence about the transaction involving Ms. Goodfellow. His evidence,
    however, played a secondary role. Ms. Goodfellows evidence, which was not
    seriously challenged in many respects, was the key evidence on this count. The verdicts
    tell us the jury got the message about the dangers inherent in relying on Lambies
    evidence alone. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants argument the trial judge failed
    to adequately protect against the misuse by the jury of evidence relevant only to
    the charges against Vickerson has merit. In the end, however, we think the
    charge adequately addressed that concern.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge repeatedly told the jury to
    consider the count separately. The format of his charge effectively separated
    the charges. The trial judge also identified the evidence relevant to each
    charge and provided the jury with a separate schedule for each count
    summarizing the relevant evidence. The trial judge did not, as he could have in
    a case like this in which most of the evidence was admissible against only one
    of the two accused, expressly tell the jury that none of the evidence, except
    the evidence on the two counts on which the appellant was charged, was relevant
    to the appellants guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Once again, however, the verdicts provide cogent
    evidence the jury did address each count separately. The jurys acquittal of
    the appellant on the charge of possession of Fentanyl for the purposes of
    trafficking indicates the jury was not swept along by improper propensity
    reasoning, based on all the evidence they had heard about the forged
    prescription scheme being operated by Vickerson and Lambie. The acquittal on
    that charge is a strong indicator the jury limited its consideration of the
    evidence to the evidence pertaining only to that transaction. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>the sentence appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge imposed concurrent 12-month
    sentences on the two uttering charges. He imposed a consecutive sentence of 6
    months on the charge of possession of stolen property. As we would order a new
    trial on the charge of possession of stolen property, the fitness of the
    sentence imposed on that charge is no longer germane. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits the trial judge erred in
    sentencing the appellant on the basis she had obtained Fentanyl. Counsel
    submits the jurys verdicts make it clear the appellant did not obtain any
    Fentanyl on either of the two occasions on which she used forged prescriptions
    in an effort to obtain Fentanyl. Crown counsel on appeal agrees the trial judge
    erred in indicating the appellant had obtained Fentanyl.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judges misdescription of the
    appellants conduct is significant. However, even though the appellant did not
    obtain any Fentanyl, the uttering offences remain serious. She attempted to illegally
    acquire a significant amount of a deadly drug, much of which was no doubt
    headed for the criminal marketplace. On a correct understanding of the facts, we
    are satisfied a sentence totalling 12 months for the two charges was not inappropriate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That brings us to the question of whether the sentence
    should be varied to a conditional sentence. In refusing a conditional sentence,
    the trial judge repeated his error by describing the appellants offences as
    involving the obtaining of Fentanyl. The only authority he referred to, <em>R.
    v. Giannilos</em>, [2016] O.J. No. 7004 (SCJ), involved an accused who had obtained
    a number of Fentanyl patches. The trial judges misapprehension of the evidence
    played a significant role in his decision that a conditional sentence was inappropriate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge fully set out the many
    mitigating factors applicable to the appellant and I need not repeat them here
    (<em>R. v. Fairbarn</em> et al., at para. 36). In addition to those factors,
    some three years have now passed since the appellant was sentenced. She has
    been on bail and there is no suggestion she has not complied fully with the
    terms of her bail. The court must also take into account the present
    circumstances. The pandemic certainly renders incarceration more difficult and
    potentially more dangerous than it was before March 2020. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the circumstances now warrant the imposition
    of a conditional sentence of 12 months. We are confirmed in our view by Crown

    sentence at this time. </span></p>
