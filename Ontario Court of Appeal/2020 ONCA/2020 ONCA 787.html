lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties entered into separate agreements for
    the purchase and sale of two abutting residential properties in Mississauga
    (the “Agreements”). The Agreements did not close because the appellant
    purchasers, </span><span lang=EN-CA>Amal Attia and Mohamed Amr Abdelraouf (the
    “Buyers”), did not have the </span><span lang=EN-CA>funds to pay the purchase
    prices. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent vendor, </span><span lang=EN-CA>Tashfeen
    Malik (the “Seller”)</span><span lang=EN-CA>, sued the Buyers seeking
    forfeiture of their $100,000 deposit and damages of $500,000 for breach of
    contract. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Seller sought and obtained partial summary
    judgment declaring that the Buyers had breached the Agreements. The motion
    judge ordered the issues of damages and the forfeiture of the deposits to
    proceed to trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Buyers appeal. At the hearing, the appeal
    was dismissed for reasons to follow. These are those reasons.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Seller was, and remains, the owner of two
    abutting properties in the City of Mississauga, municipally known as 4240 and 4246
    Cawthra Road (the &quot;Properties&quot;). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1983, the then owner of 4246 Cawthra became
    the owner of the adjacent 4240 Cawthra. After 1983, the Properties were always
    conveyed together to the same new owners. In 2013, the Seller acquired the
    Properties by entering into two separate agreements of purchase and sale and
    the Properties were conveyed to the Seller by a single transfer instrument.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On August 19, 2016, the Seller listed the Properties
    for sale through her real estate agent. The MLS listings for the Properties
    stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Brkage Remks: 4240 and 4246 Cawthra Rd Merged
    Together, Vendor Wants Both Lots to Be Sold Together. The City Has Consent For

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In September 2016, the appellant Buyer, Ms. Attia,
    contacted the Seller and her husband through Ms. Attia’s real estate agent. The
    real estate agent told Ms. Attia that the two Properties had to be sold
    together.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 7, 2016, Ms. Attia, acting in trust
    for a company to be incorporated, entered into the two Agreements. The Agreements
    provided that the purchase price for each Property was $725,000 and the deposit
    $50,000, and that closing would take place no later than December 8, 2016. The
    Agreements were later amended to add the appellant Mr. Abdelraouf as a Buyer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Attia, on behalf of the Buyers, made the
    deposits totaling $100,000, which the defendant brokerage continues to hold in
    trust.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Neither Agreement contained a mortgage financing
    condition. On October 14, 2016 the Buyers waived or deleted the provisions stipulating
    that their offers were conditional upon the approval of the terms by their
    solicitor.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Ontario Real Estate Association standard
    form was used for the Agreements, which contained the following clause
    regarding the <em>Planning Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><strong><span lang=EN-CA>15. PLANNING ACT</span></strong><span
lang=EN-CA>: This Agreement shall be effective to create an interest in the
    property only if Seller complies with the subdivision control provisions of the
    Planning Act by completion and Seller covenants to proceed diligently at
    Seller’s expense to obtain any necessary consent by completion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Agreement for 4240 Cawthra described the
    property as “Plan A24 PT LT 1143R12743 PT 6”; the Agreement for 4246 Cawthra
    described the property as “PT LT 11, PL A24, PART 5, 11, 43R12743.” Schedule A
    to the 4246 Cawthra Agreement stated that: “The Seller Agrees to provide the
    consent letter received from committee of adjustment regarding severance.”
    Schedule C to both Agreements contained a sketch of the Properties for use on
    an Application for Consent. The sketch showed that Part 6 would be severed from
    Part 5.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A Mississauga Committee of Adjustment letter
    dated July 28, 2016 recorded the Committee’s approval of the Seller’s
    application to sever the Properties, subject to the condition that the
    Committee’s provisional approval be fulfilled by July 29, 2017. The letter was
    either attached to the 4246 Cawthra Agreement or separately provided to the
    Buyers.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the Agreements, the deadline for the
    Buyers to make requisitions was November 24, 2016. On November 23, 2016,
    Buyers’ counsel emailed Seller’s counsel requisitions for each Property that
    required, on or before closing, satisfactory evidence of compliance with “The
    Planning Act, Ontario, including completion of the Planning Act statements in
    the Deed/Transfer of Land.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The requisitions also required the Seller to
    execute and return a statutory declaration to Buyers’ counsel before closing,
    paragraph 5 of which was to state:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I do not retain the fee or the equity of
    redemption in, or a power or right to grant, assign or exercise a power of
    appointment with respect to any land abutting the lands being conveyed in the
    subject transaction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><a
name="_Hlk57205284"><span lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 7, 2016, Seller’s counsel sent Buyers’
    counsel a letter enclosing the keys and closing documents to be held in escrow
    until the transfers had been registered. In the enclosed statutory declarations
    signed by the Seller (the “Statutory Declarations”), paragraph 5 had been amended
    by blacking out the word “not”, so that it read:</span></a></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I do [blacked out] retain the fee or the
    equity of redemption in, or a power or right to grant, assign or exercise a
    power of appointment with respect to any land abutting the lands being conveyed
    in the subject transaction.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The transactions did not close on December 8,
    2016. Ms. Attia admitted that the Buyers did not have firm mortgage financing
    in place. The Seller agreed to a one-day extension of the closing date to
    December 9, 2016. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On December 9, Buyers’ counsel advised that they
    had no mortgage instructions and “therefore no money to close.” Seller’s
    counsel stated that his client was “ready, willing and able to close the
    transactions on these firm deals” but was prepared to extend closing until
    December 19, 2016, provided certain conditions were met.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the Buyers did not agree to the
    conditions, the parties continued to deal with each other. <a
name="_Hlk57206276">On December 12, Seller’s counsel advised that his client
    had learned the Buyers had a mortgage in place and could close either that day
    or the next.</a> That did not turn out to be the case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over the course of the ensuing week, the
    parties, through their counsel, negotiated the terms of an extension of the
    closing date, ultimately agreeing to extend the closing until January 10, 2017,
    on terms. Amending agreements executed by the parties on December 20, 2016
    memorialized the extension agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 3, 2017, Seller’s counsel inquired of
    Buyers’ counsel “if everything’s on track for the closings.” On January 6, the
    Buyers sought a further extension of the closing date until January 26, 2017 to
    have more time to secure mortgage financing. They also inquired whether the
    Seller would enter into a vendor take-back mortgage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Seller was not prepared to grant any further
    extension or enter into a vendor take-back mortgage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Inquiries by Seller’s counsel on January 10,
    2017, the scheduled closing date, as to whether Buyer’s counsel was in funds
    went unanswered. The transactions did not close. The Buyers admit that they did
    not have the funds or mortgages in place to close the transactions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 11, 2017 Seller’s counsel informed
    Buyers’ counsel that the Buyers were in breach of the Agreements. On January
    12, 2017, Seller’s counsel advised that the Buyers were in fundamental breach
    and their deposits would be forfeited.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Between January 12, 2017 and January 25, 2017,
    the Buyers’ counsel and real estate agent made various proposals to the Seller
    to revive and restructure the transactions, including entering into a new
    agreement of purchase and sale that would cover both Properties. At no time did

    documents.</span></p>

    for forfeiture and breach of contract against the Buyers. On April 8, 2019, the

    the summary judgment motion, the Seller had not re-sold the Properties.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>III.      THE MOTION JUDGE’S REASONS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his reasons, the motion judge addressed two
    issues. First, the Buyers had argued that para. 5 of the Statutory Declarations
    stated, in respect of each of the two Properties, that the Seller was retaining
    the fee or equity of redemption in the abutting parcel, thereby contravening the
    subdivision control provisions of the <em>Planning Act</em>. According to the
    Buyers, those statements indicated that: (a) the Seller’s tender was defective,
    (b) she had repudiated the Agreements, and (c) the Agreements were invalid: at
    para. 17.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge rejected this submission. He held
    that the Buyers’ offers indicated their intention to purchase the Properties
    together and that the parties intended to treat the two Properties as merged
    and capable of being sold simultaneously in a single transaction: at para. 24.
    Relying on the decision in <em>Baker v. Nero</em> (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 646 (H.C.),
    the motion judge viewed the Agreements as constituting in substance a single
    transaction that did not sever the lands: at para. 25. He also observed that
    the subdivision control provisions of the <em>Planning Act</em> did not apply
    to a mistake made between the executing parties: at para. 27. All of which led
    him to conclude that the Seller did not breach the Agreements on December 8,
    2016 when she presented the amended Statutory Declarations to the Buyers. He
    found that the Buyers breached the Agreements on January 10, 2017 when they
    failed to pay the amounts due on closing: at para. 29. The motion judge
    concluded that there was no genuine issue requiring a trial regarding the
    breach of the Agreements: at para. 30.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second issue concerned the Buyers’
    contention that granting partial summary judgment would offend the principle
    that such relief should only be granted rarely: <em>Baywood Homes Partnership
    v. Haditaghi</em>, 2014 ONCA 450, 120 O.R. (3d) 438; <em>Healthy Lifestyle
    Medical Group Inc. v. Chand Morningside Plaza Inc.</em>, 2019 ONCA 6, 46 C.P.C.
    (8th) 25, at para. 9. Instead, the Buyers argued the motion judge should set
    the action down for trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge disagreed, holding that the
    facts regarding the breach of contract issue were not in dispute, making this
    one of the rare cases in which partial summary judgment was appropriate: at
    paras. 33-34. He directed a trial on the issues of damages and forfeiture of the
    deposit. He did not award costs.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>IV.     ISSUES ON APPEAL</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Buyers submit that the motion judge made two
    errors warranting the intervention of this court. Specifically, they contend
    the motion judged erred by:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>concluding there was no genuine issue requiring a trial with respect
    to whether the Buyers had breached the Agreements; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>granting partial summary judgment where it was inappropriate to bifurcate
    the claim, given the nature of the issues and the risk of inconsistent findings
    of fact.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>V.      FIRST ISSUE: DID THE BUYERS BREACH
    THE AGREEMENTS?</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>A.      The issue stated</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this appeal, the Buyers advance two related
    arguments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, they contend the motion judge erred in
    holding that they breached the Agreements. Although acknowledging that they
    lacked the funds to complete the transactions on the scheduled closing dates, the
    Buyers argue that the Agreements did not comply with the subdivision control provisions
    of the <em>Planning Act</em> and therefore were void. The Buyers submit the
    evidence did not permit the motion judge to conclude, as he did at para. 24 of
    his reasons, that the Buyers intended to purchase both parcels together as part
    of a single transaction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the Buyers submit that the Seller
    tendered defective closing documents – the amended Statutory Declarations – thereby
    signalling that she was not ready, willing, and able to provide marketable
    title on closing. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>B.      Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Buyers make their submissions against the
    undisputed factual backdrop that they lacked the funds to close the purchase of
    the Properties on any of the scheduled closing dates: December 8 and 9, 2016,
    and January 10, 2017. In other words, in respect of the mutually dependent
    promises to pay and to convey, the Buyers were not ready, willing, and able to
    perform their promise to pay: Victor Di Castri, <em>The Law of Vendor and
    Purchaser</em>, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2020), at </span><span
lang=EN-CA>§615</span><span lang=EN-CA>. However, the Buyers argue that the
    Seller also was not ready, willing and able to perform her promise to convey
    marketable title. That was because the Agreements were either void for
    contravening the <em>Planning Act</em>, or the Seller’s tender of documents was
    defective. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Buyers’ counsel acknowledges that the arguments advanced
    by his clients are very technical and were not raised by Buyers’ transaction
    counsel at the time of the scheduled closings. Nevertheless, the Buyers contend
    that they are entitled to point to defective performance by the Seller to
    justify their own non-performance even if they were ignorant of the deficiency
    at the time of termination: <em>Komorowski v. Van Weel</em> (1993), 12 O.R.
    (3d) 444 (Gen. Div.), at paras. 42-43.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the facts of this case, it is difficult to
    see how the Buyers can assert that they were not aware, at the time of the
    scheduled closings, of the alleged defects in title and tender on which they
    now rest their appeal – they had entered into two separate Agreements for the
    conveyance of abutting lands and the Seller had delivered the allegedly
    defective Statutory Declarations prior to the first scheduled closing. However,
    this appeal does not turn on that point. In the reasons that follow, I explain
    why I do not accept their submissions that the Agreements were void as contrary
    to the <em>Planning Act</em> or that the Seller’s tender of closing documents was
    defective.</span></p>

    Seller’s punctiliousness. Even under a system of sequential electronic
    registration, things do not occur instantaneously. There would be a moment in
    time when the Seller retained the fee in the yet-unregistered deed for the
    abutting Property, but the retained fee would disappear upon the registration
    of the second deed. As such, the Statutory Declarations could be interpreted as
    a technically correct description of the chain of events that would have
    occurred on sequential registration.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the motion judge, at para. 27, seemed
    to suggest that the amendments were errors or mistakes, although his reasons

    were a curable defect.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, at the end of the day it matters not
    whether the amendments resulted from an error or from punctiliousness. Three pieces
    of evidence regarding the Seller’s conduct demonstrate that the amendments to
    the Statutory Declarations were made in the context of the Seller’s communicated
    intention that the Agreements would culminate in the simultaneous conveyance of
    the Properties.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, in a letter dated December 7, 2016
    responding to requisitions concerning 4240 Cawthra, Seller’s counsel advised
    that “[w]e will not be completing the Planning Act statements as the Vendor
    owns 4246 Cawthra (also being purchased by your client).” A similar letter was
    sent regarding 4246 Cawthra, indicating that the Seller owned 4240 Cawthra,
    which the Buyers were purchasing.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, on December 12, 2016, Seller’s counsel,
    responding to advice from Buyers’ counsel that his clients were assigning one Property,

    are part lots</span>. I just want to mention it in case you missed it.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, in his email of January 6, 2017 to

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You told me during our telephonic conversation
    that your client can assign the properties to 2 different parties and then

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Please be advised that your client made the
    offer to purchase with full knowledge that properties have merged being
    abutting lands. The amendment to agreement for both properties dated Dec 20th
    2016 also reflects that as the names of the new buyers mirror on both the

lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These three communications clearly indicate that

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When read in the context of the Seller’s communications
    showing that the Agreements, in substance, called for simultaneous conveyances,
    the amendments to para. 5 of the Statutory Declarations cannot be characterized
    as a defect in the tendered documents or a failure to effectively answer the
    Buyers’ requisition: <em>Smith v. Tellier</em> (1974), 47 D.L.R. (3d) 342 (Ont.
    C.A.), at p. 344, rev’d on other grounds [1976] 2 S.C.R. 255. On the contrary,
    the Seller at all times made it clear that she was ready, willing, and able to
    convey marketable title to the Properties in compliance with the <em>Planning
    Act</em>, thereby fulfilling her obligation under s. 15 of the Agreements: <em>Zender
    v. Ball</em> (1975), 51 D.L.R. (3d) 499 (Ont. H.C.), at pp. 505-6. Accordingly,
    I see no error in the motion judge’s conclusion, at para. 29, that the Seller
    did not breach the Agreements on December 8, 2016 when she presented the amended
    Statutory Declarations to the Buyers.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I see no error in the motion
    judge’s conclusion that the breach of the Agreements occurred on January 10,
    2017, when the Buyers failed to pay the full amounts owing under the
    Agreements.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-CA>VI.     SECOND ISSUE: DID THE MOTION JUDGE ERR BY
    GRANTING PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Buyers submit that the motion judge erred in
    granting partial summary judgment because this is a complex, multi-issue case
    with facts and credibility issues in dispute and which lacks a gating issue that
    might save the parties from needing a trial: <em>2287913 Ontario Inc. v. Blue
    Falls Manufacturing Ltd.</em>, 2015 ONSC 7982, [2015] O.J. No. 6760, at paras. 10-11.
    They contend that the motion judge’s findings will unfairly bind the trial judge
    who considers the issues of relief from forfeiture and the claim for damages.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am not persuaded by this submission. On the
    issues as framed by the pleadings and the affidavit evidence, the risk of
    inconsistent findings of fact on the issues of liability, on the one hand, and
    the issues of forfeiture and damages, on the other, is minimal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Yet, the risk of inconsistent findings is only
    one of several matters that a motion judge must consider when asked to
    entertain a motion for partial summary judgment. Reduced to its essence, the
    decision in <em>Hryniak v. Mauldin</em>, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87 promoted
    summary judgment as a procedural tool that offers the prospect, when used in
    the right circumstances, to provide litigants with timely and affordable access
    to the civil court system: at paras. 2-5. Given that simple objective, before
    embarking on hearing a motion for partial summary judgment a motion judge must
    determine whether, in the circumstances, partial summary judgment will achieve
    the objectives of proportionate, timely, and affordable justice or, instead, cause
    delay and increase expense: <em>Butera v. Chown</em>, <em>Cairns LLP</em>, 2017
    ONCA 783, 137 O.R. (3d) 561, at paras. 29-34; <em>Service Mold + Aerospace Inc.
    v. Khalaf</em>, 2019 ONCA 369, 146 O.R. (3d) 135, at para. 14.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When faced with a request to hear a motion for
    partial summary judgment, a motion judge should make three simple requests of counsel
    or the parties: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)    Demonstrate that dividing the determination of this case into
    several parts will prove cheaper for the parties;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)    Show how partial summary judgment will get the parties’ case
    in and out of the court system more quickly; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(iii)   Establish how partial summary judgment will not result in
    inconsistent findings by the multiple judges who will touch the divided case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not know what, if any, motion case
    management or triage system was in place in the Central West Region at the time
    this motion for partial summary judgment appeared on the motion judge’s docket.
    But, had those three requests been made before embarking on the hearing, I
    strongly suspect the answer would be along the following lines: while
    proceeding with a motion for partial summary judgment was not likely to risk
    inconsistent verdicts or findings, it would certainly increase the overall
    costs of litigating this case and delay its end-point even further. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This case involves a modest amount of money,
    when assessed in proportion to the high costs of litigating civil cases in
    Ontario courts. There is a dispute over who gets to keep the $100,000 in
    deposits. The amount of damages truly at stake is quite uncertain, as the
    Seller filed no evidence on that issue. Absent such evidence, this case has all
    the hallmarks of falling within the monetary limits of a simplified procedure
    action. Bifurcating a simplified procedure action invariably will push legal
    costs into the realm of the disproportionate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue of delay must be looked at from two
    perspectives. First, the action was commenced on January 30, 2017 and set down
    for trial by the Buyers about 1.5 years later, on September 5, 2018. According
    to the Buyers’ motion confirmation form, a pre-trial conference was scheduled
    for March 2020. If that pre-trial conference date was the first available date
    (which is unclear from the record), one can certainly understand the temptation
    for a party to prod the action along by bringing a motion for partial summary
    judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>But, when looked at from another perspective, here
    the action sits, two years after being set down for trial. It still has not
    reached a final adjudication on the merits. The main money issues – who gets to
    keep the deposits and whether the Buyers must pay damages – still have not been
    adjudicated. There is every prospect that by the time those issues are
    adjudicated, this action will have languished in the Ontario civil court system
    for four to five years, an unconscionable amount of time for an action involving
    a modest amount of money.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a matter of process, I strongly disagree with
    the Seller’s decision to move for partial summary judgment and refrain from
    filing any evidence of damages and with the motion judge’s acquiescence in
    hearing the motion so framed. That said, it is not a ground for appellate
    intervention. To set aside the judgment solely on the basis that the process
    added cost and delay would, in its own turn, only add more cost and delay.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I appreciate that judicial time for civil
    matters is stretched thin in most regions of this province. But for summary
    judgment to achieve its stated objective – faster and cheaper access to a final
    adjudication on the merits – triage processes must be put in place so that
    judges end up determining a case once and for all on the merits, instead of
    slicing determinations into a series of partial summary judgments.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>VII.    DISPOSITION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Seller seeks partial indemnity costs of $5,640.10,
    inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes. That is a fair and reasonable
    amount of costs for the appeal. I would order the Buyers to pay the Seller that
    amount within 30 days of the release of these reasons.</span></p>
