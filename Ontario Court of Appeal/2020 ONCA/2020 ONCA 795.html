  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Michael Greer was convicted in the Ontario Court
    of Justice of charges arising from a residential break-in and theft of property
    that included a substantial quantity of authentic military-grade weaponry</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Shortly after the break-in on July 17, 2014, a
    confidential informant (“CI”) provided the police with information that Mr.
    Greer had been involved. Mr. Greer and his girlfriend, Theresa Ann Symes, were
    placed under surveillance. In addition, several searches were conducted which
    produced evidence central to Mr. Greer’s convictions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Specifically, in a warrantless search during a
    traffic stop on July 22, 2014, ammunition consistent with that stolen in the
    break-in was found in Mr. Greer’s bag and on his person (“the traffic-stop
    search”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On September 3, 2014, a warrantless search of a
    backpack that Mr. Greer had been seen wearing before crashing a stolen
    motorcycle, and that was found at the crash site, revealed knives or bayonets
    later identified by the owner as stolen during the break-in (“the backpack
    search”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the information from the CI, their
    surveillance, and the traffic-stop and backpack searches, police also obtained
    a warrant to search several locations linked to Mr. Greer. Those search
    warrants were executed on September 4, 2014 (”the search warrant searches”). At
    each location, property was discovered that had been stolen in the break-in.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That same day, police searched Ms. Symes’
    Chrysler Intrepid motor vehicle (“the Intrepid”) ostensibly with her consent
    (“the search of the Intrepid”). Property stolen in the break-in was found in
    the vehicle and a pair of Airwalk shoes were seized from the trunk.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Prior to trial, defence counsel served notice to
    challenge the search warrant searches under s. 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of
    Rights and Freedoms</em>. No notice was given to challenge the warrantless
    searches. In circumstances I will explain, this <em>Charter</em><i> </i>notice
    was served before defence counsel received disclosure of the Information to
    Obtain (“ITO”) that was used to procure the search warrants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Indeed, the ITO was not disclosed until the end
    of the second day of the trial. When defence counsel informed the trial judge the
    next day that he was considering bringing a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application
    to obtain leave to cross-examine the affiant of the ITO, the trial judge ruled
    that there would be no <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application. She did, however,
    permit defence counsel to file an amended <em>Charter</em><i> </i>notice. Once
    again, the amended notice identified challenges only to the search warrant
    searches.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ultimately, the trial judge found no <em>Charter</em><i> </i>violations. All relevant evidence obtained during those searches was
    admitted. Expert evidence was also presented associating one of the Airwalk
    shoes with a footprint left during the break-in. The trial judge found that the
    Airwalk shoes belonged to Mr. Greer, and convicted Mr. Greer of multiple
    charges, including break and enter, and numerous counts of possession of stolen
    property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer appeals those convictions on several
    grounds. It will be convenient to address those grounds in the following order.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, Mr. Greer’s appeal counsel, who did not
    represent Mr. Greer at trial, argues that the trial judge erred by ruling that
    Mr. Greer lacked standing to challenge the validity of the search of the
    Intrepid, which led to the seizure of the Airwalk shoes. In the alternative, he
    argues that even if Ms. Symes’ consent to the search of the Intrepid could not
    be successfully challenged, Mr. Greer nonetheless had standing to challenge the
    seizure of the Airwalk shoes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would reject this ground of appeal. As I will
    explain below, in ruling that Mr. Greer did not have a reasonable expectation
    of privacy in the Intrepid, the trial judge arrived at the only finding that
    could be supported on the evidence. As for Mr. Greer’s supplementary argument
    that the trial judge erred by not recognizing his standing to challenge the
    seizure of the Airwalk shoes, that argument was not made at trial, nor has Mr.
    Greer sought leave to make this argument for the first time on appeal. Had he
    done so, I would not have granted leave. Based on fully-litigated, material
    factual findings made by the trial judge, which I would not disturb, it is
    evident that a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge to the seizure of the Airwalk
    shoes could not possibly have succeeded, even if it had been brought at trial.
    In those circumstances, it would not be in the interests of justice to
    entertain this argument for the first time on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, Mr. Greer’s appeal counsel urges that
    the trial judge did not conduct a fair hearing of the s. 8 <em>Charter </em>issues,
    thereby causing a miscarriage of justice. He focuses, with varying levels of
    intensity, on the trial judge’s treatment of all four searches: the
    traffic-stop search, the backpack search, the search warrant searches, and the
    search of the Intrepid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would dismiss this ground of appeal, as well.
    Mr. Greer’s defence counsel did not bring <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges at
    trial to the first two searches listed above, so no miscarriage of justice can
    arise relating to those matters. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do accept that, in addressing the latter two
    searches, the trial judge failed to act fairly by making rulings without
    entertaining submissions from defence counsel, and without providing meaningful
    reasons. However, neither of these unfortunate episodes, which occurred during
    a difficult trial that got underway before the parties were fully ready to
    proceed, gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. Even if Mr. Greer had been permitted
    to bring a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application, it is evident that any
    cross-examination that could have been ordered would not have supported an
    effective challenge to the search warrants. With respect to the trial judge’s
    ruling that Mr. Greer did not have standing to challenge the search of the
    Intrepid, as I explain in analyzing Mr. Greer’s first ground of appeal, it is
    clear Mr. Greer did not have the standing he was claiming. The trial judge’s
    denial of standing was inevitable, even if a full standing hearing had been
    conducted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, Mr. Greer’s appeal counsel argues that
    the trial judge erred in upholding the issuing justice’s finding that there
    were reasonable grounds for the search warrants. As I will explain, there were
    ample grounds to support the search warrants. There is no basis for interfering
    with the trial judge’s decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fourth, Mr. Greer’s appeal counsel contends that
    the trial judge erred in finding that the Airwalk shoes belonged to him. Again,
    for the reasons provided below, that conclusion was open to the trial judge on
    the evidence. Accordingly, this ground of appeal must be dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> I would therefore dismiss Mr. Greer’s appeal.</span></p>

    residence was burglarized. Stolen property included 32 military-related
    firearms, military knives, 3000 rounds of ammunition, electronics, and Blu-ray
    DVDs. Footprints were left during the break-in, including one on the gunroom door,
    and another in the laundry room.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Shortly after the burglary, a single, unproven CI
    provided the police with information that the appellant, Michael Greer, had
    been involved in the break-in and was attempting to sell some of the stolen firearms.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer and his girlfriend, Theresa Ann Symes,
    were placed under surveillance. During the surveillance, Mr. Greer and Ms.
    Symes were observed on several occasions in a gold 2004 Chrysler Intrepid motor
    vehicle operated by and registered to Ms. Symes. They were also observed at
    Wingham Legion Trailer Park, where it was confirmed that they were occupying
    two camping lots, living in two tents. They were followed, as well, to two self-storage
    units, one at Wingham Self Storage and the other at Teeswater Super Storage. It
    was confirmed that Mr. Greer rented the two storage facilities from a single
    proprietor.</span></p>

    front seat passenger in a vehicle operated by Kent Wall. The rear hatch of the
    vehicle was open and two Ontario Provincial Police Officers, Cst. Smith, and
    Sgt. Foxton, affected a traffic stop.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Cst. Smith observed an open case of beer behind
    the passenger seat and elected to search the vehicle under the authority of the <em>Liquor Licence Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.19. Mr. Wall and Mr. Greer
    exited the vehicle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer acknowledged ownership of a bag that
    was on the floor of the passenger side of the vehicle. Cst. Smith searched the bag
    and discovered two brass nine-millimetre rounds of ammunition. Mr. Greer was
    then searched, and three more brass nine-millimetre rounds of ammunition were
    found, one with a hollow point.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When Mr. Wall exited the vehicle, Sgt. Foxton
    observed a round of .223 calibre long gun ammunition on the seat that Mr. Wall had
    vacated. Sgt. Foxton, fearing that Mr. Wall might have a weapon, searched Mr.
    Wall and discovered an empty black ammunition magazine in his cargo pants.</span></p>

    taken during the break-in.</span></p>

    disclosure of the search warrant ITOs for the first time. When that request was
    made, the single ITO used to obtain the three warrants was still under seal in
    Stratford, Ontario. Before the ITO could be disclosed, an order would be
    required unsealing it, and it had to be reviewed for possible editing to
    protect the identity of the CI who had provided the information that
    precipitated the investigation of Mr. Greer.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    the Easter weekend, defence counsel served a “boiler-plate” Notice of
    Application, seeking to bring a s. 8 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge to the search
    warrants that had been used to search Wingham Legion Trailer Park and the two
    storage facilities. The grounds identified were that the searches were
    undertaken without reasonable and probable grounds, the warrants were obtained
    with inaccurate and incomplete information, and the search warrants had not
    been properly executed. The facts supporting the enumerated challenges were not
    particularized in the Notice of Application and no references were made to any
    of the warrantless searches.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 21, 2015, the trial Crown (who is not
    Crown counsel on appeal) filed a response asking for Mr. Greer’s <em>Charter</em><i> </i>motion to be dismissed as non-compliant with the <em>Criminal Rules of the
    Ontario Court of Justice</em>, SI/2012-30 (“the rules”), as it “does not include
    any factual or detailed basis upon which the Applicant’s complaint is made, or
    the evidence he intends to rely on during the <em>Charter</em> <em>voir</em> <em>dire</em>.”</span></p>

    ITO had yet to be disclosed. Defence counsel immediately advised the trial
    judge of this, along with other concerns he had about late disclosure. He
    expressed concern about his inability to prepare properly for the trial. He commented
    that he could not proceed with a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application without
    knowing what the ITO contains.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the colloquy that followed, the circumstances
    surrounding the disclosure of the ITO were explored. The trial Crown notified
    the trial judge that the disclosure of the ITO had not been raised during the
    four pre-trials that had been held. The first time the request was made was
    over the Easter weekend, approximately three weeks earlier. She said she
    received the disclosure letter and the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>application at
    the same time. The trial Crown also explained that she was on vacation when the
    disclosure letter arrived but had since taken steps to have the ITO unsealed
    and brought from Stratford.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge questioned how defence counsel
    could set a four-day trial in which the search warrant would be challenged “when
    nobody has the ITOs”. She also told defence counsel that if he had wanted to
    bring a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application, he had set the trial “way too
    early”. Defence counsel responded that he was “fairly confident” he had
    requested the three search warrants during the “resolution meetings”. He said,
    “I suppose, really, what I assume when I ask for search warrant information is
    that the ITOs assumed in that; that, that in getting the search warrant, you,
    you get the, the ITOs as part of that disclosure.” When the trial judge
    insisted that he had to make a specific request to get the ITOs unsealed and
    produced, defence counsel said, “I was not even aware they were sealed”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Defence counsel was granted a recess to speak to
    his client. When he returned, he advised the trial judge, “I have spoken to my
    client. This trial has been set for several months. He does not want to be
    prejudiced by having to put it off.” He said he was considering asking for a
    stay of proceedings. The trial judge challenged this suggestion, noting that defence
    counsel had not made clear what responsibility the trial Crown had not
    fulfilled. She asked defence counsel if the problems could be fixed. He said
    that, after talking to his client, it was his view that the “more productive”
    course would be to move forward by dealing with Crown evidence “that doesn’t
    touch on the search warrant” or other items he was alleging had not been
    disclosed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the discussion that followed, responsibility
    for the non-disclosure of the ITO was addressed again. Defence counsel
    submitted that the Crown had an affirmative duty to provide ITOs and that he
    was not required to “go begging” for them. The trial judge disagreed and told
    defence counsel that his failure to know that the ITO had been sealed was no
    excuse. She said, “You can’t, on the morning of trial, say, ‘Oh, by the way, I
    thought about it and I asked for the ITOs to be unsealed approximately two
    weeks ago.’ It doesn’t work that way.” Later, she said, “You do not bring the <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application on the morning of trial. You bring it before the trial.”</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During their exchange, the trial judge commented,
    “I’m very concerned about the fact that you’re not ready to proceed this
    morning and [Mr. Greer is] in custody.” When questioned again about how the
    problem could be fixed, defence counsel repeated his earlier suggestion that
    they proceed with “evidence that can be called uncontentiously”. The trial Crown
    agreed with this suggestion, and the parties discussed which witnesses could be
    called. After agreement was reached, the trial proceeded.</span></p>

    Cornish, is there an issue as to the legality of the stop? I’m just wondering
    why we’re going into this. Is there an issue about the legality of the stop?”
    Defence counsel responded, “That in itself is not – not of issue” but he
    explained that he wanted to touch on the “narrative” or “backdrop”. The trial
    judge asked what the issue was, and defence counsel replied:</span></p>

    occurred. Since she had already said she could not find that Mr. Greer knew
    about or was in constructive possession of the gun magazine clip that was
    discovered in Mr. Wall’s pocket, when she spoke of the stolen property found in
    Mr. Greer’s possession she can be taken as referring to the ammunition found in
    Mr. Greer’s backpack and on his person. The trial judge said that Mr. Van Meeteren
    had identified this ammunition as having been stolen from his home during the
    break-in. The parties agree that this overstates Mr. Van Meeteren’s position.
    He could say only that the ammunition was similar to ammunition taken during
    the break-in.</span></p>

    trial judge explained her findings that Mr. Greer had constructive possession
    of the stolen property found in the tents and the storage units during the
    execution of the search warrants. She also linked Mr. Greer to the stolen goods
    found in the Intrepid:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer was in constructive possession of
    the property found in the tents and the two storage units and the Intrepid. He
    knew that property was there, he had access to the property, he appeared to be
    dealing with the property inside the Intrepid on a number of occasions when
    observed by police, and he exercised control over the Intrepid when telling the
    police not to touch his property….</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After describing how the police had observed
    both Ms. Symes and Mr. Greer rearranging the contents of the trunk of the
    Intrepid and removing, repacking, and returning items to the trunk, she said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>There was no evidence that anyone else
    accessed the trunk for the Intrepid… The reasonable inference that can be drawn
    is that Michael Greer had property in the vehicle and was in constructive
    possession of the property and was exercising control over it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She applied similar reasoning in concluding that
    the Airwalk shoes found in the trunk of the Intrepid belonged to Mr. Greer. She
    said: “The surveillance observed the accused moving and arranging items in the
    trunk, and after that no one gained access to the trunk”. She reasoned further
    that “the Airwalks, sized 12, would clearly not be worn by a female, Theresa
    Symes, judging by her respective height, as I saw on the video and as observed
    in the photos of surveillance”. In fact, the evidence was that the Airwalk
    shoes were size 10, not 12.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on her finding of possession by Mr. Greer
    of the Airwalk shoes, the evidence linking the Airwalk shoes to the crime
    scene, and Mr. Greer’s recent possession of stolen property from the break-in,
    the trial judge said, “[T]he court can draw an inference he was involved in the
    break and enter when the property was stolen.” She therefore found him guilty
    “as a primary offender, or as a party to a break and enter and the theft of
    firearms.” Based on this finding, she convicted Mr. Greer of the charge of break
    and enter and theft of firearms, contrary to s. 98(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal</em><i> <em>Code</em></i>, and the charge of break and enter a dwelling house and
    commit theft over $5000, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>.</span></p>

    Code</em>, relating to items discovered in his possession during the backpack
    search, the search of the Intrepid and the search warrant searches. Finally,
    she convicted Mr. Greer of one count of possession of ammunition, contrary to
    s. 96(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>; and two counts of possessing ammunition
    while prohibited from doing so, contrary to s.117.01(1) of the <em>Criminal</em><i> <em>Code</em></i>.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Appeal counsel argues that the trial judge acted
    unfairly in deciding that Mr. Greer did not have standing to challenge the
    constitutional validity of the warrantless “consent search” of the Intrepid. I
    will address that argument below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He also advances the ground of appeal now under
    consideration, that, whether arrived at fairly or not, the trial judge’s
    finding that Mr. Greer lacked standing to challenge the search of the Intrepid was
    simply wrong. Based on the trial record, and without advancing a fresh evidence
    application, he argues that Mr. Greer should have been found to have standing
    to challenge this search because he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in
    the Intrepid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On appeal, Mr. Greer adds an alternative, second
    standing argument not advanced at trial. Namely, that even if the consent
    search could not be successfully challenged, the trial judge erred by not
    recognizing his standing to challenge the seizure of the Airwalk shoes from the
    Intrepid.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Standing
    and the Consent Search</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even when challenging a warrantless search of a
    place, the party claiming the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>violation bears the
    burden of establishing their standing to do so by demonstrating that, in the
    totality of the circumstances, they had a reasonable expectation of privacy in
    the place that was searched: <em>R. v. Edwards</em>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128. I
    agree with the Crown that, on the evidence at trial, Mr. Greer simply cannot
    succeed in demonstrating a reasonable expectation of privacy in Ms. Symes’ car.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Seven non-exclusive factors will typically
    inform such a decision, including: (i) presence at the time of the search; (ii)
    possession or control of the property or place searched; (iii) ownership of the
    property or place; (iv) historical use of the property or item; (v) the ability
    to regulate access, including the right to admit or exclude others from that
    place; (vi) the existence of a subjective expectation of privacy; and (vii) the
    objective reasonableness of the expectation: <em>Edwards</em>, at para. 45; <em>Belnavis</em>,
    at para. 20. When these factors are considered, it is evident that Mr. Greer
    did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that could support a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge to the search of the Intrepid. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer was not present when the “consent”
    search occurred. That search had no impact on his person, or his liberty.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer did not own the vehicle. Ms. Symes
    did. He therefore had no legal authority to regulate access to the vehicle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor was there evidence that he had any <em>de
    facto</em> authority to do so. He was never observed operating the vehicle; Ms.
    Symes would do so, and he would be a passenger. When he accessed the vehicle,
    she was either immediately present or nearby.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer attempts to demonstrate his <em>de</em><i> <em>facto</em> </i>authority over the vehicle by relying on an incident that
    occurred on August 22, 2014, after Csts. Lucier and James were dispatched to a
    verbal argument on Bruce Road in Huron-Kinloss Township. When they responded,
    the officers came upon Ms. Symes’ unoccupied Intrepid. Property was strewn on the
    roadway and in a nearby cornfield. When Cst. James picked up one of the bags
    near the vehicle, Mr. Greer emerged from the bushes and directed Cst. James not
    to go through his property. With respect to this incident, I agree with the
    Crown. This was not an illustration of Mr. Greer regulating access to the car.
    He was instead regulating access to his property which was outside of the car.
    Indeed, this incident is a counter-example to his having <em>de</em><i> <em>facto</em> </i>authority over the car. The most reasonable inference is that during an
    argument Mr. Greer’s property was ejected from the vehicle by its owner, Ms.
    Symes, who was also present.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To be sure, the Crown is not in a position to
    deny entirely that Mr. Greer exercised any control over the Intrepid. In <em>R.
    v. Jones</em>, 2017 SCC 60, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 696, at para. 32, the Supreme Court
    of Canada ruled that, “a s.8 applicant may ask the court to assume as true for
    s. 8 purposes any fact that the Crown has alleged or will allege in the
    prosecution against him.” In its written argument, after identifying the two
    campsites, the two storage units, and “the gold Chrysler Intrepid belonging to
    Teresa Ann Symes”, the Crown alleged that Mr. Greer “had strong ties to each of
    these locations, in that he was in possession of property at each of those
    locations and had control over each of those locations.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To be clear, permitting the accused to rely on
    the Crown’s position to support its standing argument does not create automatic
    standing. As Harvison Young J.A. explained in <em>R. v. Labelle</em>, 2019 ONCA
    557, 379 C.C.C. (3d) 270, at para. 31:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The point of <em>Jones</em><i> </i>is that the
    accused can rely on the Crown theory to establish certain facts relevant to
    their s.&nbsp;8 claim. The trial judge is still required to assess those facts
    in the “totality of the circumstances” to determine whether the accused had a
    reasonable expectation of privacy in a particular territorial space. [Citations
    omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As indicated, the Crown theory included the
    claim that Mr. Greer had control over the Intrepid. The significance that
    should be attributed to the Crown’s position that Mr. Greer had control over the
    Intrepid can be gleaned by examining the objective evidentiary basis for the
    control alleged by the Crown. It amounts to this: throughout the relevant period,
    Mr. Greer, who was in a relationship with Ms. Symes and cohabiting with her,
    used and accessed her car to store his belongings.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Even bearing this degree of control in mind, and
    assuming Mr. Greer had a subjective belief that his belongings would remain
    protected and private while in the Intrepid, the trial judge’s conclusion that Mr.
    Greer did not have standing to challenge the search of the vehicle was
    inevitable. While Mr. Greer exercised control of the vehicle by using it to
    store his goods, there is no evidence that his control of the vehicle was
    independent of Ms. Symes’ control. As indicated, the only reasonable inference that
    the August 22, 2014 incident yields is that Mr. Greer’s ability to hold his
    property in the vehicle depended on permission from Ms. Symes. If Mr. Edwards,
    who had his own key to his girlfriend’s apartment and kept belongings there,
    did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his girlfriend’s apartment,
    Mr. Greer’s weaker claim to a reasonable expectation of privacy in Ms. Symes’
    car must fail: see <em>Edwards</em>, at paras. 48-49.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no contradiction between this outcome
    and the trial judge’s finding that the Airwalk shoes found in the car were Mr.
    Greer’s. As the decisions in <em>Edwards</em><i> </i>and <em>Belnavis</em><i> </i>illustrate,
    a person can have possessions in a place in which they do not have a reasonable
    expectation of privacy. Nor is this outcome inconsistent with the trial judge’s
    finding that Mr. Greer possessed the stolen goods found in Ms. Symes’ car. As I
    will explain below, this finding was based on circumstantial evidence linking
    him to the Airwalk shoes. The trial judge did not err in her conclusion that
    Mr. Greer did not have standing to challenge the validity of the search of Ms.
    Symes’ car.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I will now address Mr. Greer’s supplementary
    argument, made for the first time on appeal, that he had standing to challenge
    the seizure of the Airwalk shoes and that the trial judge erred by not
    recognizing this. He seeks that standing in order to argue that even if Ms.
    Symes had provided valid consent to search the vehicle, she did not have
    authority to consent to the seizure of the Airwalk shoes, and that reasonable
    and probable grounds for the seizure of the Airwalk shoes were lacking.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer has not sought leave to raise this new
    standing issue on appeal. Even if he had sought leave to do so, I would not
    have granted it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The customary articulation of the test for
    granting leave to raise a new issue on appeal states that leave may be granted
    where: (1) “the evidentiary record [is] sufficient to permit the appellate
    court to fully, effectively and fairly determine the issue raised on appeal”;
    (2) “the failure to raise the issue at trial [is not] due to tactical reasons”;
    and (3) “the court [is] satisfied that no miscarriage of justice will result
    from the refusal to raise the new issue on appeal”: <em>R. v. Reid</em>, 2016
    ONCA 524, 132 O.R. (3d) 26, at para. 43, leave to appeal refused, [2016]
    S.C.C.A. No. 432; <em>R. v. Brown</em>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918, at p. 927. I take
    this last consideration to be misstated. Logically, the fact that “no
    miscarriage of justice will result from the refusal to raise the new issue on
    appeal” is a reason not to grant leave, not a reason for doing so. In my view,
    if (1) the evidentiary record is sufficient to permit the appellate court to
    fully, effectively, and fairly determine the issue raised on appeal, and (2) the
    failure to raise the issue at trial was not due to tactical reasons, then leave
    should be granted where (3) refusing leave may result in a miscarriage of
    justice. On the other hand, if refusing leave would not cause a miscarriage of
    justice, leave to raise a new issue on appeal should ordinarily be denied.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>One final, relevant consideration. Where the new
    issue arises from a change in the law while the case is still “in the system”,
    leave may be granted to present an evidentiary record on appeal: <em>R. v. J.D</em><i>.</i>,
    2018 ONCA 947, 367 C.C.C. (3d) 403.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After considering these factors, I find that it
    is not in the interests of justice to grant leave to raise the new standing
    argument on appeal. I am mindful that Mr.&nbsp;Greer’s trial occurred before <em>Jones</em><i> </i>was decided. Prior to <em>Jones</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> it would have been tactically unwise for Mr. Greer to claim ownership of the
    Airwalk shoes so that he could claim a privacy interest in those shoes to
    establish standing to challenge their seizure: <em>Jones</em>, at paras. 18,
    22-24. Notwithstanding this, had Mr.&nbsp;Greer brought a leave application, I
    would deny it because the new <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges that Mr. Greer
    claims to have standing to bring would not have succeeded had they been brought
    at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, Mr. Greer’s keystone legal proposition
    that “the warrantless search of the Chrysler Intrepid could not be justified
    based on Symes’ third party consent” misses the mark. To be sure, there is a
    longstanding principle that a third party cannot “validly consent to a search
    or otherwise waive a constitutional protection on behalf of another”: <em>R. v.
    Cole</em>, 2012 SCC 53, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 34, at para. 79. However, the police
    did not rely on Ms. Symes’ consent to seize the Airwalk shoes. They relied on
    her consent to be lawfully present in her car without a warrant. Once lawfully
    in that place, the authority to seize the Airwalk shoes derives from s. 489(2)(b)
    of the <em>Criminal</em><i> <em>Code</em></i>,<i> </i>which authorizes the
    police to seize any thing without warrant that they have reasonable grounds to
    believe “has been used in the commission of an offence”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Cst. Lucier lacked reasonable grounds to seize the Airwalk shoes have succeeded,
    had this argument been advanced at trial. This is known because the credibility
    and reliability of Cst. Lucier’s testimony relating to how he came to seize the
    Airwalk shoes was litigated fully during the trial proper, on the question of
    whether the Airwalk shoes could be linked to Mr. Greer. </span></p>

    and the imprint on the gunroom door”. She was not dissuaded in accepting this
    testimony by the fact that Cst. Lucier produced police notes at the last minute
    to support this evidence, or by the fact that those notes did not record that
    he had observed similarities between the footprint and the Airwalk shoes.</span></p>

    trial judge found, based on testimony that Cst. Myatt gave, that “[it] took an
    expert analyst to do a professional comparison to determine that the Airwalks
    had not made that footwear print on the gunroom door.” Clearly, it was the
    trial judge’s conclusion that Cst. Lucier had an honest, reasonable mistaken
    belief that the Airwalk shoes likely made the print on the gunroom door. </span></p>

    seizure of the Airwalk shoes, that challenge would have failed. It is simply
    not in the interests of justice to permit Mr. Greer to raise a standing

lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer contends that “the trial judge’s approach to the s. 8 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge rendered the trial unfair”. This is a ground of appeal advanced
    under s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. As such, even if the
    trial judge did not act fairly in the approach that she took, this ground of
    appeal cannot succeed unless a miscarriage of justice has occurred. As I will
    explain, I accept that the trial judge did not act fairly in some of the
    rulings that she made. However, I am persuaded that, despite this, no
    miscarriage of justice occurred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Appeal counsel’s submissions focused most intently on the trial
    judge’s treatment of the traffic-stop search, and the search of the Intrepid.
    Issue was also taken with the trial judge’s treatment of the backpack search,
    but the trial judge’s treatment of this search was given less emphasis in
    argument. Although not raised in his factum, in oral argument Mr. Greer also
    addressed the trial judge’s <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>ruling. In each case, the
    heart of Mr. Greer’s complaint is that the trial judge failed, unfairly, to
    consider any of these issues on their merits.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Context is particularly important in evaluating this ground of
    appeal, and a salient contextual consideration is that Mr. Greer failed to give
    notice, as required by the rules, of any of the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges
    he relies on in this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer’s appeal counsel attempted to dull the impact of Mr.
    Greer’s failure to give notice by pointing out that notice was given to
    challenge the search warrants, the grounds for which were predicated on the
    warrantless searches he now seeks to challenge. If, with this submission,
    appeal counsel is suggesting that when notice is given that search warrants are
    being challenged, this constitutes notice that warrantless searches that produced
    information relied upon to secure those search warrants will also be challenged,
    I would disagree.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The purpose of notice is: (1) to alert the court to impending <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges so that trial time can be accurately estimated and pretrial
    applications can be organized and conducted in a focused manner, and (2) to
    enable the Crown to identify the matters in issue so that the Crown can
    effectively prepare for the trial and answer the challenges made: <em>R. v.
    Tash </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(2008), 166 C.R.R. (2d) 358 (Ont.
    C.A.),</span></em> at para. 15; <em>R. v. Kutynec</em> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d)
    289 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 297, 301-2. Only explicit notice of <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges can serve these dual objectives. Permitting notice by implication
    would defeat them. If an accused intends to challenge preliminary searches that
    produced information used to support a challenged search warrant, the accused
    must say so in their Notice of Application. If they have not done so, as here, then
    notice was not provided.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>If appeal counsel was simply making the more modest suggestion that,
    in this case, the Crown could not have been prejudiced because the Crown must have
    understood that by challenging the search warrants, Mr. Greer would also be
    challenging the underlying warrantless searches, I again disagree. If anything,
    where a Notice of Application expressly includes only search warrant
    challenges, the most likely inference is that those will be the only challenges
    brought.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In her treatment of some of the issues raised by Mr. Greer during
    trial, the trial judge relied on defence counsel’s non-compliance with the
    notice requirements under the rules. For others, she relied on what she
    perceived to be a patent lack of merit in positions taken by defence counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>A trial judge is permitted, in the exercise of their trial
    management powers, to summarily dismiss <em>Charter</em><i> </i>motions on both
    these bases. Absent special circumstances, such as those described in <em>R. v.
    Sabir</em>, 2018 ONCA 912, 143 O.R. (3d) 465, at para. 32, trial judges “may
    decline to entertain a motion where no notice, or inadequate notice, of the
    motion has been given to the other side”: <em>R. v. Loveman</em> (1992), 71
    C.C.C. (3d) 123 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 125. Similarly, trial judges may refuse to
    hear <em>Charter</em><i> </i>motions that have no reasonable prospect of
    success or may terminate motions when it becomes evident that they are
    frivolous: <em>R. v. Cody</em>, 2017 SCC 31, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 659, at para. 38. A
    decision by a trial judge to summarily dismiss a motion on either basis is
    ordinarily entitled to deference: <em>R. v. Blom</em> (2002), 167 C.C.C. (3d)
    332 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 28; <i>R. v. <em>Kazman</em></i>, 2020 ONCA 22, 452
    C.R.R. (2d) 185, at para. 16, leave to appeal refused, [2020] S.C.C.A. No. 58.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Deference will not be due, however, if the trial judge conducted a
    hearing that was so unfair as to result in a miscarriage of justice. Just as a
    fair trial guarantees the accused “basic procedural fairness” (<em>R. v. Harrer</em>,
    [1995] 3 S.C.R. 562, at para. 45) so too does a fair <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge.
    The demands of procedural fairness depend entirely on context: <em>R. v.
    Rodgers</em>, 2006 SCC 15, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, at para. 47. Two of the
    requirements of procedural fairness that arise in the context of the summary
    dismissal of <em>Charter</em><i> </i>motions are relevant to this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>First, the accused must be given an opportunity to make submissions
    before summary dismissal occurs. As a trite, general proposition, the right to
    make submissions before a ruling is an essential component of the principle of <em>audi
    alteram partem </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(that parties have the
    right to be heard):</span></em><em> R. v. D’Allesandro</em>, 2018 BCCA 118, 359
    C.C.C. (3d) 350, at paras. 17-20. The right to make submissions is also a
    central component of the right to make a full answer and defence: <em>R. v.
    Aucoin</em>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 554. The trial management authority to dismiss <em>Charter</em><i> </i>motions summarily will not be exercised fairly if this authority is used without
    first permitting submissions from the accused as to whether summary dismissal
    is warranted. When Rosenberg J.A. provided his influential instruction on the general
    trial management power in <em>R. v. Felderhof</em> (2003), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 498
    (Ont.), at para. 40, he said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It would undermine the administration of
    justice if a trial judge had no power to intervene at an appropriate time and,
    like this trial judge, <span class=Underline>after hearing submissions</span>,
    make directions necessary to ensure that the trial proceeds in an orderly
    manner. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Where a trial judge is considering summary dismissal without an
    evidentiary inquiry because a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>claim appears to be
    meritless, the trial judge should ensure that the defence is aware of this and
    is “able to summarize the anticipated evidentiary basis for its claim” so that
    the trial judge has the information required<em>: Kutynec</em>,<i> </i>at p. 301; <em>R. v. Papasotiriou-Lanteigne</em>, 2017 ONSC 5337, 390 C.R.R. (2d) 222, at
    paras. 22-23. This includes providing the accused with an opportunity to argue
    against summary dismissal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Submissions are no less critical where summary dismissal is based on
    non-compliance with the rules. Before summarily dismissing a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>claim because of non-compliance with the rules, trial judges are required
    to consider all relevant circumstances: <em>Blom</em>, at para. 22. This
    includes the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>argument sought to be advanced, prejudice
    to the opposing party, and the impact that permitting the motion to proceed
    would have on the trial process: <em>Loveman</em>, at p. 127; <em>Tash</em>, at
    para. 15(7). Explanations for non-compliance with the rules may also be of
    importance. For the decision to be made fairly, a trial judge will therefore need
    to ensure that trial counsel is alerted that summary dismissal is being considered
    and is given an opportunity to provide material information and submissions so
    that the trial judge can finally and fairly determine whether summary dismissal
    is in fact appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>To be clear, I am not suggesting that a full evidentiary hearing
    needs to be conducted to determine whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing. The
    issue should first be addressed by oral submissions, but some evidence may
    prove to be necessary before a full <em>voir</em><i> <em>dire</em> </i>is
    dispensed with: <em>R. v. Vukelich </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>(1996)</span></em>,
    108 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 17-23. In receiving such submissions,
    a trial judge is also entitled to ensure that the submissions are relevant,
    focused, and efficient.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The second relevant requirement of procedural fairness is the trial
    judge’s obligation to explain why a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>motion is being summarily
    dismissed, if that is the decision that is made. For example, the decision of
    the trial judge to summarily dismiss a s. 11(b) application was overturned in <em>R.
    v. Imola</em>, 2019 ONCA 556, 439 C.R.R. (2d) 352, after the trial judge failed
    to give sufficient reasons for the summary dismissal that occurred. In <em>R.
    v. Sheppard</em>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at paras. 44-45, Binnie J.
    made clear that the duty to give reasons applies to <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rulings.
    This duty must necessarily apply, as well, to rulings that dispense with the
    need for a full <em>Charter voir dire</em>. The sufficiency of reasons is therefore
    a relevant consideration in determining whether procedural fairness has been
    achieved in the summary dismissal of a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>motion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Having expressed the principles that I will be relying upon, I will
    examine, in turn, the trial judge’s treatment of the issues raised by Mr. Greer
    on appeal. It is convenient to begin with the backpack search.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Backpack Search</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not act unfairly in addressing <em>Charter</em><i> </i>issues relating to the backpack search for the simple reason that no such
    issues were raised. As indicated, no challenge was made to this search in
    either Notice of Application, and at no time did Mr. Greer rely on the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>to contest the admissibility of the evidence found during this search.
    Indeed, in his second Notice of Application, Mr. Greer proceeded on the basis
    that the knives or bayonets that were discovered during this search could be
    considered in assessing whether there were reasonable and probable grounds for
    the search warrants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The fairness of the trial judge’s treatment of this warrantless
    search is only challenged in Mr. Greer’s contention that the trial judge failed
    in her obligation to consider whether the Crown had discharged its burden of
    rebutting the presumptive unreasonableness of the three warrantless searches.
    This submission must be rejected because the Crown had no such obligation
    relating to the backpack search. The Crown burden to demonstrate the
    reasonableness of a warrantless search arises only if that search is in issue
    in the case, and the constitutional validity of the backpack search had not
    been made an issue in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I can find no unfairness on the trial judge’s part relating to this

lang=EN-CA>Nor did the trial judge act unfairly with respect to the traffic-stop
    search, again for the simple reason that Mr. Greer never advanced a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>application relating to this search. The most that can be said is that
    defence counsel wanted to explore during his cross-examination whether there
    might be a basis for a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge. I will explain.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Once again, defence counsel did not bring an application to
    challenge the constitutional validity of this search. As a result, the trial
    judge appropriately confronted defence counsel with the relevance of his attempted
    cross-examination of Sgt. Foxton about the search. When she did so, defence
    counsel affirmed that he was not taking issue with the search but said that he wanted
    the evidence as “narrative” or “backdrop”. He then said that although he had
    not initially contemplated that the stop would be the subject of any <em>Charter</em><i> </i>right argument, “it may well be that there are some issues in play”
    relating to whether the search went beyond a liquor licence search, but he
    could not know “until we know what the evidentiary basis is in the trial”. He
    grounded the possibility of a potential <em>Charter</em><i> </i>issue in
    whether the evidence of the two officers was consistent, without attempting to
    explain to the trial judge how inconsistent evidence might assist in
    establishing a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>breach.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In these circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to simply
    direct defence counsel to move along. Absent special circumstances, a trial provides
    an opportunity to bring <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges, not an opportunity
    to explore whether there may have been <em>Charter</em><i> </i>breaches.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I recognize that during the colloquy, the trial judge, without
    inviting full submissions, precipitously expressed her opinion that Mr. Greer
    had no standing to bring a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge to the traffic-stop
    search. Given that the constitutional validity of that search was not before
    her, this had no impact on the fairness of her treatment of Mr. Greer’s <em>Charter</em><i> </i>application so I will say no more of it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> However, on two occasions, the trial judge did make similar,
    precipitous rulings prohibiting <em>Charter</em><i> </i>applications without
    notifying counsel in advance of her intention to do so, and without inviting
    full submissions. These incidents, relating to the <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application
    and the search of the Intrepid, are more concerning.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>A <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application is ordinarily brought prior
    to trial to secure leave of the court to cross-examine the affiant of a search
    warrant ITO in order to determine whether the ITO affiant made full, frank, and
    accurate disclosure of the material facts to the issuing justice: <em>R. v.
    Garofoli</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421; <em>R. v. Pires; R. v. Lising</em>, 2005 SCC
    66, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 343. Where it is shown through cross-examination that full
    and frank disclosure has not been made, the ITO will be amended before the
    sufficiency of the grounds for issuing the warrant is reviewed. The amendment
    of the ITO may undermine the grounds for the warrant, leading to the warrant
    being quashed: <em>R. v. Phan</em>, 2020 ONCA 298, 387 C.C.C. (3d) 383, at
    para. 53; <em>R. v. Booth</em>, 2019 ONCA 970, 386 C.C.C. (3d) 281, at para. 101.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Amendment can be achieved through “excision” or “amplification”. Excision
    occurs when information shown to be inaccurate is simply deleted from the ITO. In
    contrast, as stated in <em>Booth</em>, at para. 59: “Amplification entails
    adding information that should have been disclosed in order to give an accurate
    picture or replacing mistakenly inaccurate information with accurate
    information”: <em>Booth</em>, at para. 59. Not all inaccurate information can
    be corrected by amplification. Information should not be added where it “could
    advance the warrant application” unless “the error in not making full and frank
    disclosure is: (1) a ‘minor technical error’; and (2) made in ‘good faith’”: <em>Booth</em>,
    at para. 59.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Given the nature and purpose of permissible cross-examination, it is
    obvious that counsel cannot responsibly bring a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application
    without having examined the ITO. In order to obtain leave to cross-examine in a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application, the accused must show that there is a “basis
    for embarking on an enquiry”: <em>Pires</em>, at para. 10. Specifically, the
    accused must show that there is a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination
    of the affiant will elicit testimony about the accuracy or completeness of the
    information in the ITO that is of probative value on the admissibility of the
    evidence: <em>Pires</em>, at paras. 30-31.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Testimony will have probative value on the admissibility of evidence

    This will occur if the cross-examination leads to the excision or amplification
    of inaccurate or incomplete information in the ITO that could undermine the
    sufficiency of the grounds for issuing the warrant. Alternatively, exposing
    inaccurate or incomplete information through cross-examination may reveal unconstitutional
    misconduct by the affiant to the ITO. This will be so where the affiant has engaged
    in “deliberate non-disclosure, bad faith, deliberate deception, fraudulent
    misrepresentation or the like”: <em>R. v. Paryniuk</em>, 2017 ONCA 87, 134 O.R.

lang=EN-CA>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On the third day of trial, the morning after receiving disclosure of
    the ITO, defence counsel advised the trial judge that he was seeking
    instructions from Mr. Greer on a possible <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application.<i> </i>The trial judge’s response was swift and decisive. Without calling for
    submissions or waiting for an application to be filed, she ruled peremptorily
    that no such application would be permitted.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The sole reasons the trial judge expressed were that defence counsel
    had waited too long to bring the application, and that defence counsel bore
    responsibility for the delay because he was too late in making his disclosure
    request. Based on earlier relevant exchanges between the trial judge and
    defence counsel, it can fairly be inferred that the trial judge was of the view
    that it was not in the interests of justice to allow a late-breaking <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application to interrupt and delay the trial, particularly given defence
    counsel’s own expressed desire to proceed with the trial without adjournment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On its face this decision may seem compelling, but there were
    arguments available to the contrary. In keeping with their obligations
    subsequently expressed in <em>R. v. Jordan</em>, 2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R.
    631, at paras. 85-86, the parties had agreed to a prompt trial date only seven weeks
    away from the set date. In those circumstances, allowances for late preparation
    might reasonably be required. Moreover, understood in this context, the request
    for disclosure of the ITO, although made uncomfortably close to the beginning
    of the trial, had been made relatively promptly after the set date. As well, even
    the trial Crown was scrambling to get ready for trial. Disclosure was still
    being made as the trial got underway, and the trial Crown herself had arguably
    not acted with dispatch in responding to the disclosure request. There were
    also outstanding disagreements between defence counsel and the trial judge
    relating to whether it was customary for ITOs to be disclosed as a matter of
    course without specific request, or whether a request for disclosure of search
    warrants should be taken as including a request for disclosure of the ITO used
    to obtain the search warrant. If resolved favourably to the defence after
    argument or evidence, these considerations could well have had a profound
    impact on whether the trial judge should disallow a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application,
    if one was to be brought.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not raise these points to cast doubt on the reasonableness of the
    trial judge’s decision to refuse to entertain a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application
    if brought in aid of Mr. Greer’s search warrant challenge, since I need not
    concern myself with the merits of that decision to resolve this ground of
    appeal. I raise these points simply to underscore the unfairness of the trial
    judge’s decision to make this ruling without inviting or receiving submissions.
    Indeed, when defence counsel attempted to make submissions after the trial
    judge raised the issue of summary dismissal by ruling that “[a] <i>Garofoli </i>application
    will not be happening”, the trial judge cut him off, reaffirming her ruling with
    curt and cursory reasons. I understand that the trial judge was faced with the
    unenviable challenge of moving a serious trial along when it was evident that
    the parties were not fully prepared, and that defence counsel had repeatedly
    been unclear about where the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>issues were heading.
    Still, the trial judge should not have summarily foreclosed the prospect of a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application in this way. In my view, she acted unfairly.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I am nonetheless satisfied that there has been no miscarriage of
    justice. I do not rest that decision on the fact that, at the time the ruling
    was made, a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application was only a hypothetical
    possibility, although this is a relevant factor. I am persuaded that there has
    been no miscarriage of justice because there is no air of reality to the
    possibility that cross-examination of the ITO affiant could have changed the
    outcome of the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges brought on Mr. Greer’s
    behalf. Appeal counsel has identified only two areas where alleged inaccuracies
    in the ITO could possibly have led to the cross-examination of the affiant, and
    neither would have mattered.<i> </i>Those two areas of alleged inaccuracy
    relate to the backpack search.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Specifically, appeal counsel contends that: (1) the ITO inaccurately
    reported that Det. Cst. Dunn observed the knives or bayonets in the backpack at
    the scene of Mr. Greer’s motorcycle crash, when it was Cst. Boudreau who had
    done so; and (2) the ITO communicates that Mr. Greer “was wearing” the backpack
    when the decision to search was made, when in fact Mr. Greer had been seen wearing
    a backpack when he retrieved the motorcycle from the storage unit, and the
    backpack containing the knives or bayonets was found on the ground near the
    crashed motorcycle after the crash.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I am prepared to accept, for the purpose of analysis, that these are
    inaccuracies in the ITO that would have been exposed had Mr. Greer been
    permitted to cross-examine the affiant. However, I do not accept that exposing
    these inaccuracies could have affected the result or Mr. Greer’s <em>Charter</em> application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Appeal counsel’s first argument to the contrary is that, without the
    inaccurate information that Mr. Greer was wearing the backpack at the time of
    his arrest, the search of the backpack could not be found to be a valid search
    incident to arrest. I am unpersuaded that this is so, but even if true, this could
    not have affected the outcome of Mr. Greer’s <em>Charter</em><i> </i>claims,
    given that he did not bring a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge to the backpack
    search. In these circumstances, even if a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application would
    have undercut support for a finding that the backpack search was a legal search
    incidental to arrest, nothing would have changed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Nor could the exposure, through cross-examination, of the discrepancies
    that appeal counsel identifies have had any impact on the outcome of the search
    warrant challenges that Mr. Greer did bring. This is not a case where the
    inaccurate information would have been excised if it had been exposed during a <i>Garofoli </i>application, thereby leaving the ITO without reference either to the
    discovery of the knifes or bayonets, or to Mr. Greer’s possession of the
    backpack. Instead, amplification would have been ordered, replacing the
    inaccurate information with accurate information.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This can be said with confidence because there is no realistic basis
    for believing that the inaccuracies were anything but good faith, technical
    errors. The affiant had nothing to gain by withholding the accurate information
    and offering the inaccurate information. The strength of the search warrant application
    remains unchanged regardless of which officer discovered the knives or bayonets
    in the backpack. And it makes no material difference to the grounds for the
    warrant whether Mr. Greer was wearing the backpack after the accident, or the
    backpack was linked to Mr. Greer circumstantially by its discovery on the
    ground near the fallen motorcycle that Mr. Greer, the sole occupant of the
    motorcycle, had just crashed in a single vehicle accident. Simply put, a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application would not have advanced Mr. Greer’s <em>Charter</em><i> </i>application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I therefore accept that the trial judge acted unfairly in summarily preventing
    Mr. Greer from bringing a <em>Garofoli</em><i> </i>application without first
    inviting submissions on the matter, but I am persuaded that this ruling did not
    result in a miscarriage of justice as it had no effect on the outcome of the
    trial.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The second occasion on which the trial judge summarily prohibited
    Mr. Greer from raising a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>issue without notifying
    counsel of her intention to do so, and without inviting full submissions,
    occurred on the fourth day of trial and related to the seizure of the Airwalk
    shoes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA> It will be recalled that defence counsel had not given notice of
    his intention to challenge the constitutional validity of the warrantless search
    of the Intrepid. Indeed, he did not do so even in the second Notice of
    Application. Yet, after that second Notice was filed, when the Crown called
    Cst. Lucier, who testified that the Airwalk shoes were discovered during the
    “consent” search of Ms. Symes’ car, defence counsel objected saying that there
    would need to be a <em>voir</em><i> <em>dire</em></i> into the validity of Ms.
    Symes’ consent to that search.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>It is worth repeating the exchange that then occurred. The trial
    judge’s immediate response was to say: “The only person who has standing to make
    that argument is Ms. Symes.” Defence counsel objected to that conclusion,
    saying, “You’ve heard that they have use of that vehicle together. So for the
    Court simply to summarily say there’s no standing whatsoever for Mr. Greer to
    advance an argument on that basis I would differ with.” The trial judge replied:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I know you differ with me and I’ve made the
    ruling. Mr. Greer has no standing to raise a <em>Charter</em><i> </i>argument
    about a consent signed by Ms. Symes on a vehicle that, all the evidence I’ve
    heard so far, is her property, she is the owner. That’s the ruling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Without question, there were compelling grounds for dismissing this
    motion for failure to comply with the rules. Even with the benefit of argument,
    it is unlikely that Mr. Greer could have persuaded the trial judge otherwise,
    had that been the basis for her decision. But it was not. As the foregoing
    exchange confirms, the trial judge purported to exercise her discretion to
    summarily dismiss Mr. Greer’s request because, in her view, the proposed <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenge lacked merit as Mr. Greer had no standing to bring it. She made
    that decision without inviting submissions, even after being alerted by defence
    counsel that he had a different view of the law. And she did so without
    explaining the basis for her disagreement with counsel’s position. It was
    unfair for her to proceed this way.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Once again, I am persuaded that the unfair process did not result in
    a miscarriage of justice. As I explained when addressing Mr. Greer’s first
    ground of appeal, we know from the standing argument Mr. Greer made before us
    that his claim to standing to challenge the consent search is based solely on
    evidence that was adduced at trial. I therefore have no misgivings that, had
    the trial judge not summarily dismissed his standing argument at trial, he may
    have a better record on which to make his standing argument. He made before us
    the argument that the trial judge would not hear, and, as I have observed, I
    found that argument to be untenable. Even had the trial judge permitted
    submissions on whether the standing argument should be summarily dismissed for lack
    of merit, the outcome would have been the same.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Similarly, no miscarriage of justice can arise from the claim that Mr.
    Greer advanced for the first time on appeal, relating to his standing to
    challenge the seizure of the Airwalk shoes. I have already expressed my view
    that even if he were to prevail in that standing argument, it can confidently
    be said that the <em>Charter</em><i> </i>challenges he would use that standing
    to advance would not have succeeded at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Since the outcome would have been the same even if the judge had dealt
    fairly with Mr. Greer’s standing claim, he can show no miscarriage of justice.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    AND PROBABLE GROUNDS FOR THE SEARCH WARRANTS?</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Mr. Greer did not press the issue during oral argument of whether
    there were reasonable grounds for the search warrants that were executed on
    September 4, and with good reason. There was ample information in the ITO upon
    which the reviewing trial judge could find that “the issuing justice, acting
    judicially, could find reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an
    offence has been committed and that evidence of the offence would be found at
    the specified [places]”: <em>R. v. Shivrattan</em>, 2017 ONCA 23, 346 C.C.C.
    (3d) 299, at para. 25, leave to appeal refused, [2017] S.C.C.A. No. 93.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The ITO was framed as being based upon information from a CI. This
    called for an examination of how compelling the information is, how credible
    the CI is shown to be, and whether the information the CI provides is corroborated: <em>R. v. Debot</em>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at p. 1168. The trial judge
    recognized that the conclusory information provided by the CI was not compelling,
    and that, as an informant, he was “unproven” and “untested”. However, these observations
    are considerations in evaluating the reasonableness of reliance on a CI, not
    conditions that preclude the existence of reasonable and probable grounds:<i> <em>Shivrattan</em></i>,
    at paras. 27-28. The trial judge was entitled to find that the impressive
    corroboration that was included in the ITO overcame these apparent weaknesses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Specifically, the ITO disclosed that on July 22, 2014, during the traffic-stop
    search five days after the break-in, Mr. Greer was in possession of ammunition
    that was similar to ammunition taken during the break-in. At the time, Mr.
    Greer was prohibited from possessing ammunition. He was also in the company of
    Mr. Wall, who was found in possession of a stolen ammunition magazine.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The ITO further disclosed that on September 3, 2014, two “knives/bayonets”
    that had been stolen from the break-in were found in a backpack linked to Mr.
    Greer after he crashed a stolen motorcycle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This evidence provides a credibly-based probability that Mr. Greer had
    been involved in the break-in and would possess stolen property from the
    break-in. Indeed, I agree with the Crown that, even without the CI, the events
    of July 22, 2014 and September 3, 2014 would have sufficed to provide
    reasonable grounds for the search warrants. Those two occasions on which Mr.
    Greer was found in possession of goods that were likely linked to the break-in
    would have been enough.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In coming to this conclusion, I have considered that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence in asserting that Mr. Van Meeteren identified the
    ammunition found on Mr. Greer as stolen, when the ITO in fact reported only
    that Mr. Van Meeteren said he had “similar ammo taken”. No miscarriage of
    justice arises from this. The timing of the discovery, the nature and
    circumstances in which this similar ammunition was found, and the subsequent
    discovery of other property definitively linked to the break-in in Mr. Greer’s
    possession easily show a credibly-based probability, even bearing in mind that Mr.
    Van Meeteren could not definitively link the ammunition to the break-in.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I would reject this ground of appeal.</span></p>

    AIRWALK SHOES BELONGED TO MR. GREER?</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s finding that the Airwalk shoes belonged to Mr.
    Greer is entitled to deference. There was a solid evidentiary foundation for this
    holding. Evidence showed that Mr. Greer was permitted to keep personal property
    in Ms. Symes’ Intrepid, including footwear. Only he and Ms. Symes had been
    observed placing items in the motor vehicle. He was observed reaching into the
    trunk of the Intrepid the day before the “consent” search. The Airwalk shoes
    were men’s shoes. Based on her observation of the shoes and of Ms. Symes, the
    trial judge was satisfied that they would not have fit Ms. Symes. This was her
    decision to make.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s conclusion that the shoes belonged to Mr. Greer
    was therefore not unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence. Nor is her
    conclusion undermined by her description of the size 10 shoes as size 12 shoes.
    She misspoke. She made that error on one occasion, accurately describing the
    shoes as size 10 on more than one occasion in the same judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I do not accept Mr. Greer’s contention that the trial judge was also
    incorrect in observing that “there was no evidence that anyone else accessed
    the trunk for the Intrepid during the observation period.” That is an accurate
    description of the evidence. Had others been observed accessing the trunk, the
    circumstantial case linking Mr. Greer to the Airwalk shoes would have been
    weakened. The fact that no such observations were made is not irrelevant or
    improper to consider. Nor does the fact that others were observed driving the
    car or being around the car change this.</span></p>
