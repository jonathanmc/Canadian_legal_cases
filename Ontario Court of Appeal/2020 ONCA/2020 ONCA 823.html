lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of sexual assault,
    assault with a weapon, uttering a threat to cause death, and criminal
    harassment by engaging in threatening conduct against his now estranged spouse.
    He received a global custodial sentence of 42 months and various ancillary orders.
    The appellant appeals his convictions and seeks leave to appeal his sentence.
    He also moves for leave to introduce fresh evidence in support of his appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span lang=EN-CA>Brief Factual Background</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant committed these offences in the
    context of his deteriorating marriage to the complainant. The couple was
    married in 2004 and subsequently had three children. The trial judge found that
    the complainant told the appellant that she wanted a divorce and attempted to
    have him sign divorce documents that he threw in the garbage. The trial judge
    accepted the complainant’s evidence and found that the appellant physically and
    sexually assaulted her numerous times during their marriage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, on March 8, 2015, the appellant
    assaulted the complainant with a broomstick, pushed her on the floor, and
    kicked her. That same evening, the complainant made a 911 call to the police.
    While she did not disclose these acts to the police over the telephone, she
    indicated to the 911 operator that she wanted a divorce.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge determined that, upon the
    discovery of compromising photos of the complainant with her cousin, the appellant
    compelled the complainant to leave the family home on December 23, 2016,
    threatening to kill her and distribute the photos of her to their families if
    she did not leave the house. The appellant admitted that he did subsequently
    distribute the photos to some members of their respective families and that,
    ultimately, violence towards the complainant and her cousin could result from this
    action. The trial judge found that the appellant also took steps to alienate
    their children from the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><b><span lang=EN-CA>Conviction Appeal</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While the appellant raised numerous grounds for
    appeal in his written submissions, he significantly narrowed the issues during
    oral submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the appellant denied committing the
    offences and attested to a completely different version of events. On appeal, he
    submits that the trial judge erred in her assessment of the appellant’s evidence.
    According to the appellant, the trial judge failed to carry out the requisite
    analysis in accordance with the principles articulated in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA>[1991] 1 S.C.R. 742</span><span lang=EN-CA>.
    Specifically, the appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended
    evidence concerning the timing of the complainant’s divorce application that
    was commenced in June 2016. This misapprehension, according to the appellant, caused
    the trial judge to negatively assess and reject the appellant’s evidence that
    nothing had precipitated the complainant’s 911 call to the police on March 8,
    2015. In support of the latter submission, the appellant relies on evidence from
    the Family Court proceedings commenced in June 2016 that he tenders as fresh
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not accept these submissions, nor do we
    admit the fresh evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, it is clear from the trial judge’s
    reasons that she did not simply choose between the complainant’s and the
    appellant’s respective versions of events but considered the whole of the
    evidence. Moreover, the trial judge did not base her rejection of the appellant’s
    evidence simply on his denial that the complainant had told him prior to March
    2015 that she wanted a divorce and that he thought she was joking when she
    called 911. The trial judge gave numerous reasons for finding that the appellant’s
    evidence was “unreasonable and illogical” and that his evidence, as well as the
    evidence of his sister-in-law and his eldest daughter, did not leave her with a
    reasonable doubt. The trial judge found that the complainant “testified in a
    genuinely sincere manner with attention to details and cautious to be clear on
    what she remembers and what was not so clear in her memory” and that “[s]he does
    not contradict herself and is unshaken on the core of her evidence.” We see no
    error in the trial judge’s analysis or conclusions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the trial judge did not misapprehend the
    evidence concerning the timing of the divorce proceedings. The evidence elicited
    during the complainant’s cross-examination confirmed that she had issued a
    formal application for divorce against the appellant in June 2016, some 15
    months after her 911 call to the police on March 8, 2015. However, she also testified
    that, prior to March 2015, she had obtained divorce papers from the court that
    her husband refused to sign and either threw away or hid from her. It was open
    to the trial judge to accept this evidence and find that, prior to March 2015,
    the complainant had spoken to the appellant about obtaining a divorce and
    attempted to have him sign documents before she commenced a formal application
    in June 2016. In any event, the trial judge recognized that, even if there were
    some confusion about when the complainant broached the subject of divorce with
    the appellant, there could be no issue that he knew on March 8, 2015 that she
    wanted a divorce and that she was not joking. The trial judge’s reasons reveal
    no inconsistency or misapprehension of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Fresh Evidence</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to the tendered fresh evidence, we
    are not persuaded that it meets the criteria for admission of <em>Palmer v. The
    Queen</em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA>[1980] 1 S.C.R. 759</span><span lang=EN-CA>.
    First, the referenced documents could have been put before the trial judge with
    due diligence, given that they were in the possession of the appellant as a
    party to the Family Court proceedings, and his counsel on this appeal
    represents the appellant in those proceedings. Further, the referenced contents
    could not reasonably have affected the outcome at trial. As we earlier
    observed, the information about the timing of the commencement of the divorce
    application was already part of the trial evidence. As a result, it is not
    necessary in the interests of justice to admit the evidence.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Sentence Appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the sentence is
    demonstrably unfit and that the trial judge erred in relying on parental
    alienation as an aggravating factor. The appellant indicates that the issue of
    parental alienation should have been left for determination in the divorce

    appropriate range for similar offences by similar first-time offenders. The
    general range for the offence of forced intercourse against a spouse, alone, is
    between 21 months and 4 years: <em>R. v. Smith</em>, 2011 ONCA 564, 274 C.C.C.
    (3d) 34, at para. 87. In the case at bar, a global custodial sentence of 42
    months is fit, as the appellant committed multiple, violent offences against
    the complainant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the trial judge correctly held, the
    appellant’s serious offences against the complainant were committed in the
    context of an abusive domestic relationship, which is an aggravating factor
    under s. 718.2(a)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. In
    addition, the trial judge could properly take into account as aggravating
    factors on sentencing the egregious particulars of the offences that she was
    satisfied the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt. These included the appellant’s
    emotional and physical mistreatment of the complainant, as well as the
    complainant’s expulsion from the home by the appellant and his efforts to
    alienate his children from their mother.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That the issue of parental alienation also arises
    in the Family Court proceedings between the complainant and the appellant did
    not preclude the trial judge from relying on it as a relevant, aggravating
    factor on sentencing. The trial judge did not exceed her jurisdiction in her
    treatment of this factor. She expressly noted that the issue of custody was not
    before her, as the criminal trial is separate from the Family Court proceedings.</span></p>
