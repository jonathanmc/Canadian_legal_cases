  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Grounds of
    Appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant advances three grounds of appeal.
    He says that the trial judge erred:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>in failing to sever the Spence murder count from
    the James, Facey, and Cole murder counts; </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>in delivering an unbalanced or unfair charge to the jury; and </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>in permitting the Crown to adduce evidence of the appellants motive
    to kill James and Facey. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, whether considered individually or
    cumulatively, the grounds of appeal are unavailing. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #1: Severance of Counts </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principal ground of appeal advanced by the appellant
    is that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant his application to sever the
    trial of the count charging the murder of Spence from the trial of the counts
    charging the other murders. In large measure, the claim for severance was
    anchored in the appellants claim that he wished to testify on the James,
    Facey, and Cole counts, but not on the Spence count. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This argument has three branches. The appellant
    contends that the trial judge erred: </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>in concluding that an admission of fact proposed
    by counsel at trial was not sufficient to address any harm that would result
    from severance;</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>in attaching too little weight to the appellants stated testimonial
    intentions; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>in overestimating the length of time that would be required for two
    separate trials had severance been granted. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Several basic principles inform our decision on
    this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The general rule for joinder of counts in s.
    591(1) of the <em>Criminal Code of Canada</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> is that any number of counts for any number of offences may be joined in the
    same indictment, provided they are distinguished in the manner shown in Form 4.
    Section 589 governs those situations where counts other than murder can be
    joined on an indictment containing a murder count. Although s. 591(1) is
    subservient to s. 589, the combination of those provisions permits the joinder
    of multiple murder counts on a single indictment: </span></em><em>R. v. Durant</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2019 ONCA 74, </span></em>144 O.R. (3d) 465<em><span
style='font-style:normal'> at paras. 67-69.</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>Section 591(3)(a)
    of the </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'> also permits a trial judge to sever the
    trial of some </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>counts </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>in an indictment from other counts in the same
    indictment. Once again, like the rule permitting joinder, the authority to
    sever does <em>not</em> distinguish between indictments containing only counts
    charging murder and those charging only offences other than murder: <em>Durant</em>,
    at para. 70. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>Decisions on applications for severance,
    whether of counts or accused, involve the exercise of discretion. Orders for
    severance do not issue as of right. To engage the discretion, the trial judge
    must be satisfied that the interests of justice require severance. Beyond
    that, s. 591(3)(a) does not reveal the factors or considerations of which the
    trial judge must take account: <em>Durant</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    at para. 71. </span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>The phrase</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> the interests of justice acknowledges and seeks to balance an
    accused persons interest in being tried on the evidence properly admissible
    against them on the one hand, and societys interest that justice be done in a
    reasonably efficient and cost effective manner on the other: <em>Durant</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 72, citing </span></em><em>R. v. Last</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, 2009 SCC 45, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 146, at para. 16; and </span></em><em>R.
    v. Jeanvenne</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2010 ONCA 706, 261
    C.C.C. (3d) 462, at para. 28. The </span></em>interests of justice are not
    commensurate with the interests of the accused, or the accuseds perception
    of the fairest trial possible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>Over time, the authorities have poured
    content into the phrase the interests of justice. They have done so by
    designating several factors as worthy of cognizance in deciding where the
    interests of justice settle in the factual intricacies of individual cases.
    But those same authorities have underscored that no single factor is
    dispositive of the severance decision: <em>Durant</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 73. </span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>Among the
    factors the authorities have identified as relevant to determination of the
    severance issue, two are invoked here as of importance. Each warrants brief
    consideration. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>First, the
    desire to testify on some but not all counts. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>As a general
    rule, the asserted desire of an accused to testify on one or more of several
    counts, but not on others, is accorded substantial weight. But it must be more
    than a barren assertion. There must be some objective reality to it grounded in
    the evidence reasonably anticipated at trial. This factor is not dispositive.
    Others may overpower it, such as whether there is any significant disproportion
    in the strength of the Crowns case as between or among the various counts: </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Durant</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>,

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In support of his application to sever the trial
    of the Spence count from the trial of the other counts, defence counsel
    proposed that an agreed statement of fact could be filed at the trial of the
    other counts. It would provide that the appellant had physical possession of
    the [fatal] 9 mm handgun on September 10, 2010, the day of Mr. Spences
    murder. This admission was only for the purposes of a trial, where following
    a ruling that the Spence homicide is severed from the current [four count]
    indictment, the Crown proceeds on the remaining two homicide occurrences
    Facey/James and Cole <b><u>first and jointly</u></b> [emphasis in original]. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that the trial judge
    erred in rejecting the proposed admission as a complete answer to the question
    of severance. This admission would render unnecessary any introduction of
    evidence about the Spence murder at the trial of the remaining counts and the
    duplication of the evidence about the other counts on the later Spence trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In support of his submission that the trial
    judge was wrong in not giving effect to this proposal and ordering severance of
    the Spence count, the appellant summons the decision in <em>R. v. Backhouse</em> (2005), 194 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the decision in <em>Backhouse</em> does not control the result in this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <i>Backhouse</i>, the appellant was charged
    with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder as a result of
    three shootings that had taken place during a home invasion. The issue at trial
    was the identity of the shooter. Despite defence objections, the Crown was
    allowed to adduce evidence that, about nine months after the shootings on which
    he was being tried, the appellant was involved in another shooting. Forensic
    evidence identified the weapon used in the shootings in both cases as the same
    gun. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unlike this case, <i>Backhouse </i>had to do
    with the admissibility of evidence relating to the appellants possession and
    use of a handgun nine months after the offences charged. This evidence of after-the-fact
    conduct was extraneous to the offences charged. That is not this case. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The <i>Backhouse </i>court concluded that the
    evidence about the later possession and use of the firearm should not have been
    admitted at trial. Not as circumstantial evidence connecting the appellant to
    the handgun used in the shootings charged, and not as evidence of similar acts
    to assist in proof of the identity of the shooter in the offences charged: <em>Backhouse</em><em><span

lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>The exclusion in </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Backhouse</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> is rooted in its singular
    facts. The </span><span lang=EN-CA>manner in which Backhouse used the gun on
    the later occasion did not increase the probative value of the evidence that he
    had possession of the gun months after the shootings charged. But the manner in
    which Backhouse used the gun significantly increased the prejudicial effect of
    the evidence. The use evidence included the circumstances of the shooting,
    the motive for the shooting, and the fact that he had previously attacked the
    victim of the later shooting. Thus, the reasoning and moral prejudice
    associated with the use evidence tilted the balance in favour of exclusion. Against
    this factual backdrop, Rosenberg J.A. concluded that the trial Crown in <i>Backhouse </i>ought to have accepted the defence counsels offer to admit that Backhouse
    had possession of the murder weapon on the later occasion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>In our view, </span></em><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Backhouse </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>creates no <em>per se</em> rule that a proposed admission of subsequent possession of a murder weapon
    mandates exclusion of evidence of the circumstances of that possession in
    another trial. So to hold would be to replace the careful balancing of
    probative value and prejudicial effect, a case-specific exercise exemplified by <em>Backhouse</em> itself, with a rule of presumptive inadmissibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge considered the
    defence position that <em>Backhouse</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em>was
    dispositive<em><span style='font-style:normal'>. He concluded otherwise based
    on distinctions between the circumstances of the cases. </span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the trial judge explained, the evidence in
    this case strongly supported the inference that the appellant had and used the
    same gun to kill four people on three occasions within a period of 75 days.
    Each use involved a killing, and each killing was charged as a count in the
    indictment. Proof of possession was inextricably linked to use. The appellant
    does not dispute that evidence of his possession of the murder weapon on each
    charged count was admissible across the remaining counts. And the evidence that
    established that possession was evidence of use. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unlike <i>Backhouse</i>,<i> </i>this case does
    not involve evidence of misconduct extrinsic to that charged. Nor does this
    case involve the retrospectant use of evidence of extrinsic misconduct with its
    inherent moral prejudice and, arguably, lessened probative value due to its
    lack of contemporaneity with the offences charged. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge concluded
    that unlike <em>Backhouse</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, the
    evidence surrounding use of the gun appreciably enhanced the probative value of
    the evidence: </span></em></span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The inference of continuous or even exclusive
    possession is stronger where the possession of the gun on the various occasions
    is exclusive and enduring, and is stronger still if the possessor made use of
    it. The extent of a persons association with a gun is obviously greater when
    they make repeated use of it, rather than simply hold it, but both ordinarily
    amount to possession. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The manner in which a discretion is exercised in
    the circumstances of one case does not create a bright-line rule that requires
    its exercise in the same way in another. Each case is different. Probative
    value is a variable. So too is prejudicial effect. Neither is a constant. To
    erect from the result of an exercise of discretion in one case a bright-line
    rule that the same result must follow in different circumstances is to abandon
    discretion, not to exercise it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, we see no error in the trial
    judges rejection of the proposed admission of possession as a basis on which
    to grant severance. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Intention to Testify</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in failing to accord sufficient weight to the appellants stated intention to
    testify in relation to the counts charging the murders of James, Facey, and Cole,
    but not on the count alleging the murder of Spence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says that the disparity in the
    nature and extent of the evidence implicating him in the murders of James,
    Facey, and Cole, on the one hand, and of Spence, on the other, required him to testify
    in the former cases, but not in the latter. On the counts relating to James and
    Facey, eyewitnesses pointed to him as the shooter. And if he testified on those
    counts, the appellant accepted that he would also have to testify on the count
    charging the murder of Cole. But not so on the count relating to Spence. There
    was nothing to answer, hence no need to testify. Unless the Spence count was
    severed, the appellant said that he would be unable to testify on any of the
    counts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Another factor made it essential that the
    appellant testify in the counts charging the murders of James and Facey. One of
    the eyewitnesses, a passenger in the vehicle from which the fatal shots were
    fired, was Kevin Williams. The appellant alleged that Kevin Williams, not he, was
    the shooter. The only source of that evidence was the appellant himself.
    Williams would also testify about the appellants involvement in the Cole
    murder, but not as an eyewitness. Williams evidence of the Cole murder was
    that the appellant had texted him about shooting someone in the melon. This
    is consistent with the wounds suffered by Cole and contemporaneous with his
    shooting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The situation was different, the appellant
    contended, in connection with the Spence murder count. True, the appellant had sent
    some incriminating texts to Williams about the killing, however, Williams
    testimony involved only his interpretation of them. Additionally, Williams was
    a <em>Vetrovec</em> witness with his own purpose to serve. He could give no
    direct evidence of the appellants participation, unlike in the counts charging
    the murders of James and Facey. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The error of the trial judge on this issue is said
    to be that he failed to afford the significant weight that was due to the
    appellants announced testimonial intention. Indeed, the appellant says, the
    trial judge substituted his own view of the assertion for that of the appellant: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I do not doubt the sense of Moores
    consideration of testifying in relation to the James and Facey homicides, where
    he is faced with the incriminating eyewitness evidence from a <i>Vetrovec </i>witness,
    and given his own intention to make a third party suspect allegation. What I do
    have difficulty with is his rationale for not testifying on the other counts.
    To put it simply, the Crowns evidence in relation to each of the Spence and
    the Cole homicide draws a fairly tight noose. Of course, testifying is risky.
    But leaving the allegations unanswered is also risky. In saying this, I have
    not forgotten the force of the presumption of innocence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In our view, the trial judge did not err in the
    manner in which he approached the issue or in the conclusion he reached. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Read as a whole, the reasons of the trial judge
    exemplify a clear understanding of why the appellant wanted to testify on the
    counts relating to the murders of James and Facey: eyewitness testimony
    pointing to the appellant as the shooter; the shots fired from the vehicle
    consistent with that of the appellant; and a desire to point to Williams as the
    actual shooter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants testimonial intention was a
    product of the nature and strength of the evidence against him on the counts on
    which he wished to testify. The trial judge expressed wonderment about why the
    appellant would not also want to testify on the other counts in light of the
    apparent strength of the case for the Crown. This observation, whether a
    misspeak or otherwise, was not without some force on an objective view of the
    strength of the Crowns case across all counts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Considered in their entirety in the
    circumstances of this case, we are satisfied that the trial judges decision on
    severance was firmly grounded in a measured consideration of the interests of
    justice and informed by those factors identified as relevant by the
    authorities, in particular the decision in <i>Last.</i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge took into account the legal and
    factual nexus between the counts. He considered that, although the evidence in
    a joint trial of all counts would be voluminous, it lacked overall complexity
    and thus would not unduly tax the abilities of the trier of fact. He noted that
    even with severance, the determination about across-count admissibility (a
    ruling not challenged here) would result in the same evidence being repeated at
    each trial with no diminution of any prejudice arising from the joint trial of
    multiple counts. And that prejudice would be diminished by careful jury
    instructions. The trial judge might have added that, to the extent the
    appellant proposed an admission of fact under s. 655 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    the proposal would come to naught without the agreement of the Crown: <em>Castellani
    v. The Queen</em>, [1970] S.C.R. 310, at pp. 315-16.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The stated intention of an accused to testify on
    some counts but not others in a multicount indictment is a factor that is
    given significant weight, but it is one factor to be balanced with all the
    others: <i>Last</i>, at para. 27. It is not dispositive. It is not a get a
    separate trial card which, when played, wins the hand. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The nub of the appellants complaint is the
    weight the trial judge assigned to one of several factors that informed the
    exercise of the judicial discretion to sever counts in the interests of
    justice. This decision, like others involving the exercise of discretion, is
    subject to deference in this court. So too, is the weight assigned to the
    factors relevant to the exercise of that discretion. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>Trial Length Considerations </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also contends that the trial judge
    erred when he concluded that, if he acceded to the proposed severance of
    counts, there would be two trials of essentially the same length. As the trial
    judge characterized it, while one trial of all counts would be quite long, two
    trials might well each be equally long if I granted severance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred
    in this assessment. Perhaps the trials would not be of equivalent length if
    severance were granted on the basis the appellant proposed. At the very least,
    however, there was likely to be significant overlap between the two trials. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The proposed admission was about possession of a
    firearm at the time Spence was killed. It was designed to eliminate the
    introduction of evidence to prove the appellants complicity in the murder of
    Spence at the trial of the other three counts. But only if those counts were
    tried together and before the trial on the count alleging the murder of Spence.
    To be effectual as an admission of fact under s. 655 of the <em>Criminal Code, </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>the appellant</span></em> required the consent of the
    Crown. That consent would seem unlikely when the Crown sought across-counts use
    of the evidence of each shooting. And the proposed admission would have no
    effect on the introduction of evidence on the trial of the severed count
    relating to Spence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, the trial judge did not assign any
    real importance to this factor in his severance analysis and decision. We are
    satisfied that it does not reflect error. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This ground of appeal fails. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #2: The Unbalanced and Unfair Charge Allegation</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that the charge to the
    jury was at once unbalanced and unfair. The appellant extracts passages from
    the charge that, he says, reveal a heavy judicial hand on the scales disturbing
    their balance and demonstrating where the trial judges sympathies resided.
    This was all the more so, the argument continues, in a case such as this where
    the defence called no evidence and closed to the jury last. In these
    circumstances, the trial judges expressions of opinion, invariably adverse to
    the position advanced by the defence, acted as a rebuttal of the defence
    position. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The parties agree on the governing principles. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A trial judge is entitled to express opinions on
    issues of fact in the charge to the jury. Those opinions may be expressed as
    strongly as the circumstances permit, provided that what is said amounts to
    advice, not direction, and the judge makes it clear that the jury is not bound
    to follow, indeed free to disregard, the judges views on these issues: <em>R.
    v. John</em>, 2017 ONCA 622, 350 C.C.C. (3d) 397, at para. 108, citing <em>R.
    v. Lawes</em> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 15 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 20-21, 34,

    2005 SCC 27, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 627 at para. 27. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, from time to time, even where a trial
    judge has instructed the jury that it is not bound by the judges views on
    these issues, a judge may exceed permissible limits. This happens when the
    judge expresses an opinion that is far stronger than the facts warrant, expresses
    an opinion so strongly that the jury is likely to be overawed by it, or expresses
    an opinion that deprives an accused of a fair presentation of the defence: <em>John</em>,
    at paras. 109-10; <em>Lawes</em>, at paras. 22-23; and <em>R. v. Garofoli</em> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 133, reversed on other grounds,

    charge mindful of our obligation to adopt a functional approach; our purpose is
    to determine whether the jury was properly, not perfectly, instructed: <em>R.
    v. Jacquard,</em> [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at paras. 2, 62. Among the duties of a
    trial judge is the obligation to inform the jury of the relevant evidence and
    to assist them in linking that evidence to the issues they are to consider in
    reaching their verdict: <em>R. v. Rodgerson</em>, 2015 SCC 38, [2015] 2 S.C.R.
    760 at para. 34. Our assessment of the adequacy of the charge requires a
    consideration of the charge as a whole, not a microscopic post-mortem of
    extracted parts: <em>R. v. Daley</em>, 2007 SCC 53, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523 at

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge chose to comment
    on several factual issues which were for the jury to decide. The law permitted
    him to do so. Indeed, it accorded to him, as with every judge presiding in a
    criminal jury trial, a wide latitude on how to charge the jury and what to say
    to them about the evidence. We hasten to add, though, that the existence of a
    discretion does not compel its use. Wading into the domain of the jury, as the
    trier of fact, is often fraught with unnecessary risk that sometimes
    jeopardizes the hard work and dedicated service of the jury in reaching a
    verdict. We are satisfied that this did not happen here. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, when examined <em>in situ</em>,
    many of the impugned aspects of the charge amount to no more than the trial
    judge directing the jurys attention to aspects of the evidence that bore upon
    contested issues. We do not intend to address each objection, only to highlight
    a few as illustration. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For instance, the Crown sought to connect the
    appellant to the murder weapon for each homicide through a number of means. One
    of the means was a shooting close to the apartment of an acquaintance of the
    appellant. That acquaintance owed the appellant money. The appellant had
    threatened her prior to the shooting, specifically mentioning that he would
    fly shots. Following the murders of Facey and James, but before the Cole
    murder, someone shot at the acquaintances upstairs neighbours apartment with
    the same 9 mm gun used in each of the murders. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During closing submissions, defence counsel
    suggested that it was not the appellant who had shot at the apartment. After
    all, he knew where his acquaintance lived. If the appellant had been the
    shooter, he would not have fired at the apartment above that of his
    acquaintance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge
    stepped over the line when he suggested to the jury that, given the set-up of
    the apartment, as disclosed by the evidence, one might have thought that the
    appellants acquaintance lived upstairs, not downstairs. The trial judge was
    careful in his observations. He expressly told the jury that he was not
    expressing a personal view on this issue, but only alerting the jury to
    another point of view. He concluded the matter is entirely up to you. Read
    contextually, we see nothing unbalanced or unfair about the trial judges
    observation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant points to another passage in the
    charge where, he says, the trial judge undermined the defence. Kevin Williams
    testified that street guns are often borrowed and/or held in common by a number
    of people, whether within Williams circle or an organization. The appellant
    objects to the fact that the trial judge reviewed that evidence and pointed out
    that he had seen no evidence, and heard no suggestion, that the appellant was
    part of an organized gang in 2010. He was right on this point. There was no
    such evidence. The observation counselled the jury about speculation. Once
    again, the trial judge specifically told the jury that it was a matter for
    them to determine. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, defence counsel argued that it was a
    notorious fact that after you kill someone with a gun, you dont keep that gun:
    you dont keep a gun that has a body on it. The trial judge commented that he
    did not know whether this was such a notorious fact. However, he acknowledged
    that it was a commonsense proposition. He then suggested that it was equally
    unwise to continue to rent, borrow or share a gun after it has been involved in
    a serious crime. He added that the logical thing to do with the gun was to get
    rid of it, permanently. However, that obviously did not happen with the 9mm in
    this case. This was an observation on the obvious: the gun was used four times
    to kill people. With that said, the trial judge went on to say that the
    question of whether the appellant would hold onto a gun after it was involved
    in the serious crime, wise or not, is entirely up to you. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, these instructions merely focused
    the jurys attention on controverted issues of fact. They did not invite,
    rather enjoined, speculation. Neither their number nor nature rendered the
    charge, taken as a whole as it must be, unbalanced or unfair. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the appellant submits that some of
    the opinions expressed by the trial judge were improper. For instance, the
    appellant says that the trial judge improperly commented upon the text sent by
    the appellant to Williams in the wake of the Spence homicide. The appellant
    wrote that he was terrorizeing [<em>sic</em>] the borrows. The trial judge
    pointed out what he considered obvious: that the borrows mightmean the
    suburbs, and might include Scarborough. As a further example, the trial judge
    is said to have waded too deeply into the fray when he described a witness reluctance
    to testify about something: in examination-in-chief, after much resistance and
    protestation, she finally acknowledged, after watching the video of her own
    interview, that Mr. Moore had something against the Weston Road area as a
    result of being shot there.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, none of the examples relied upon by
    the appellant demonstrate that the trial judge crossed the line between the
    permissible expression of an opinion and a direction to the jury to decide a
    factual issue in a particular way. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, we have decided that the trial
    judges evidentiary comments did not render the charge unbalanced or unfair. They
    were not stronger than the circumstances warranted, nor were they such that
    individually or cumulatively they were likely to overawe the jury or impede a
    fair presentation of the defence. The trial judges instructions on the
    positions of the defence in relation to each count were clear and attracted no
    objection from very experienced trial counsel. But our rejection of this ground
    of appeal should not be considered a licence to test the limits of the
    discretion to which we have referred. Sometimes the best comment is no comment. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #3: The Evidence of Motive </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial Crown alleged that the motive to kill
    Facey and James involved the appellants view that, as an aspiring rap artist,
    it was critical for him to have a reputation for violence. In pursuit of that
    reputation, the appellant killed Facey and James so as to impress Williams, who
    was the appellants rap mentor. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the appellant had been shot in the
    face at 1765 Weston Road in 2001. The trial Crown argued that the appellant
    remained resentful of the area where the shooting had taken place. This
    provided another motive for murdering Facey and James, who were standing in
    almost the exact location where the appellant had been shot years earlier. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant was said to have a motive
    to murder Spence because he was found walking in an area of Toronto where the
    appellants younger brother had been assaulted. Mr. Williams testified that the
    appellant had told him that some guys had jumped his brother, and so anyone
    he saw in that location was going to get killed or shot at. As the trial judge
    put it in the charge, it was the perfect location for him to shake the streets
    by an act of violence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To begin, we acknowledge that the motives relied
    upon by the Crown were out of the ordinary. However unusual they may have been,
    they were well grounded in the evidence adduced at trial. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Evidence of motive is among the items of
    circumstantial evidence most often received in a criminal trial. It is commonly
    used in a prospectant sense. Evidence of the existence of a motive to do an act
    is offered to prove the subsequent doing of that act and the state of mind with
    which that act was done: <em>R. v. Salah</em>, 2015 ONCA 23, 319 C.C.C. (3d)

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence relied upon to establish motive is
    usually circumstantial. Sometimes it is evidence of a persons conduct. At
    other times, it is evidence of events about the person tending to excite the
    emotion likely to lead to the conduct in issue: <em>Wigmore</em>, at </span><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The circumstances which tend to excite a given
    emotion, thus a motive to act, involve the entire range of human affairs and
    conduct. There is no closed list. No circumstances can be said, <em>a priori</em>,
    to be without the power to excite a given emotion. In general, any fact may be
    offered which can be conceived as tending with others to excite the emotion in
