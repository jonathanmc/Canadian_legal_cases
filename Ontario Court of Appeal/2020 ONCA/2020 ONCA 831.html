  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his convictions for sexual
    assault, sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching, sexual assault
    with a weapon, and uttering a threat to cause bodily harm, in relation to the
    daughter of his former common law partner. The events were alleged to have
    occurred on a regular basis from 1991 to 2003, when the complainant was between
    the ages of 5 and 16.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The abuse allegedly started with sexual
    touching, and escalated over the years to oral sex and intercourse. It
    continued until the complainant moved out of her mother’s house at age 16, but
    was not reported to the police until 2016.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There were only three witnesses at trial: the
    arresting officer, the complainant, and the appellant. The evidence of the
    arresting officer was largely peripheral, except on one issue, discussed below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal focuses on three errors that the
    trial judge purportedly made in his assessment of the appellant’s evidence. For
    the reasons that follow, we dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The evidence at trial</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is unnecessary to review all the
    complainant’s evidence for the purpose of these reasons. The complainant’s
    evidence was, on its face, detailed, explicit and candid.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that the appellant
    started to touch her sexually when she was 5 years old. The abuse progressed to
    digital penetration around the age of eight, and then to oral sex. The
    complainant described how the appellant “took [her] virginity with a wooden
    stick” when she was 12 years old. She said he had given her a puppy as a
    birthday present, which she regarded as a “bribe” for what was to come. She
    recalled that the appellant had a wooden stick, sanded and shaped like a penis,
    which he lubricated and inserted into her vagina to break her hymen. After this
    incident, intercourse began on a regular basis. She spoke about the first such
    occasion in detail. She also recounted two other specific instances of
    intercourse, giving details as to the locations and the positions employed by
    the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant described an incident, around
    the age of 13, when the appellant put peanut butter on her clitoris and had her
    dog lick it off.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant testified that there were
    frequent acts of intercourse between the age of 12 or 13 and the age of 15,
    when she began menstruating. She said that she eventually got used to the
    appellant’s sexual advances, as “[i]t started feeling like a job.” She almost
    looked forward to it because the appellant would reward her with spending money
    and exciting toys, like a go-cart.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified. While he corroborated
    peripheral details of the complainant’s evidence, he denied ever having touched
    her in a sexually inappropriate way.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge undertook a thorough and objective review of the
    evidence by looking first at the complainant’s testimony and then the
    appellant’s. At that stage, he made no assessment of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>He then turned to his analysis. He
    instructed himself on the application of the presumption of</span><span
lang=EN-CA> innocence, the burden of proof, and the requirement of proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt. The trial judge noted that he had to be “sure” that the
    appellant committed the offences, and “only after considering all of the
    evidence and not simply preferring one side’s version over that of the other.”
    He stated that since the appellant had elected to testify, making this a “she
    said/he said” case with demonstrably opposed versions of events, he was obliged
    to follow the approach established in <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
    742. He also identified the potential for frailties in a case that involved
    events from 28 years earlier, and that depended on an adult complainant giving
    evidence about her childhood experiences. The trial judge cautioned himself
    about stereotypical thinking. He observed that “[d]emeanour, while a relevant
    consideration, ought not to be over-emphasized” and “[a]n apparent lack of
    motive to fabricate ought not to influence shifting the burden of proof to the
    accused.” He recognized that in the context of prosecuting a historical sexual
    assault case, it was important to distinguish between credibility and
    reliability when assessing the evidence of the complainant and the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge observed that the appellant’s evidence corroborated
    the complainant’s evidence on peripheral matters. The trial judge noted that in
    the appellant’s examination-in-chief, he asserted denials of sexually
    inappropriate touching “in the broadest of terms” and, when asked about
    specific acts of sexual misconduct, “[t]he denials were brief and always
    limited to either ‘No’ or ‘I did not’ or ‘I did no such thing’ or ‘No, I did
    not’.” The trial judge remarked that the appellant “answered in the same
    limited and structured manner in response to allegations of impropriety put to
    him in cross-examination by the Crown.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge identified three aspects of the appellant’s evidence
    that raised concerns for him. These are discussed in the analysis section
    below.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>gave detailed reasons for his acceptance of the
    complainant’s evidence. </span><span lang=EN-CA>He found the complainant to be
    “compelling in respect to both her credibility and the reliability of her
    evidence. It was provided in a straightforward, forthright and unembellished
    manner, worthy of belief. She was honest, truthful and sincere.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>He noted that the complainant’s evidence was
    responsive to questions put to her by Crown and defence counsel. The
    complainant was “candid and notably honest even when her evidence didn’t depict

    at trial, her initial statement to police, and her evidence and
    cross-examination at the preliminary hearing. Nor was there evidence of
    partiality, malice or bias against the appellant. Some of her testimony was
    detailed and specific, and she was able to relate certain incidents of abuse to
    other events in her life.</span></p>

    6 years old and living on Cooper Street, she told another child that the
    appellant had touched her inappropriately. She said that this disclosure
    resulted in the school principal contacting the CAS, and the police coming to
    the family home, speaking to her parents, and taking her to the CAS offices to
    be interviewed. The complainant recalled that the appellant spoke to her before
    she went to the CAS. He was crying as he told her that she should not say
    anything about what had happened because he did not want to go to jail. She
    described being at the CAS premises and being afraid that she would be taken
    away from her family. She told the CAS that she had not been touched by her
    stepfather and that she had been misunderstood. The matter was subsequently
    dropped. The complainant testified that the majority of the sexual acts of the
    appellant occurred after this incident.</span></p>

    whether he remembered an incident involving the police and CAS when the family
    lived on Cooper Street and when the complainant was 5 or 6 years old. He
    replied: “No, I don’t recall anything like that. It could have happened, I have
    no idea, maybe I wasn’t there, [the complainant’s mother] never said nothing to

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. … And, sir, again this morning,
    [appellant’s trial counsel] asked you about whether or not you recall an
    incident which the Children’s Aid Society as well as the police became involved
    at the house on Cooper Street?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. I know nothing of that. Nothing was ever
    said to me about that.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. Okay. Your evidence was, no, I don’t recall
    anything like that. Maybe I wasn’t there.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. I might have been gone because nobody
    mentioned anything to me about that incident.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. Okay. You’d agree that would be a pretty
    significant incident?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. Well, I didn’t know anything about it.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. Okay. You’d agree though it’s a pretty

    investigate an allegation of abuse.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. I would say.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q. Okay. But yet you have no independent
    recollection of that happening?</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A. I do not have any recollection of any of

    independent evidence that a report had been made to the CAS. The arresting
    police officer testified that he had located a police report from 1995 (when
    the complainant would have been about 9 years old), but neither he nor any of
    the other witnesses gave evidence about the content of the report, and it was
    not made an exhibit at trial. The trial judge observed that he could not
    speculate whether the police report related to this incident. The complainant’s
    mother, who lived in British Columbia, was not a witness at trial, although the
    Crown had brought an application to permit her to testify by closed circuit
    video. The application was opposed by the defence and was dismissed.</span></p>

    that the trial judge made inappropriate use of the CAS evidence. Without making
    a finding that the CAS investigation took place, the trial judge assumed that
    it did occur, and used the appellant’s inability to recall the incident to
    discount his evidence and detract from his credibility.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>. Both the complainant and the appellant
    testified that he was a stepfather figure to her, and that they had a close,
    father/daughter relationship. In this context, the appellant’s explanations for
    not being aware of the CAS incident made no sense: “It could have happened …
    maybe I wasn’t there” and “I might have been gone because nobody mentioned
    anything to me about that incident.”</span></p>

    remember, it could have happened” is an appropriate and understandable answer
    for a witness. It is heard in courtrooms every day. But there are some events

    to the house and taken the complainant in a police car to the CAS, it stands to
    reason that the appellant would have heard about it, even if he were not there
    when it occurred. And if he had never heard about it, because it was fabricated
    by the complainant, the explanation he gave, “it could have happened … maybe I
    wasn’t there”, was completely illogical. The trial judge was entitled to treat

    expressed concern about the manner in which the appellant denied his
    wrongdoing. He stated:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>His responses in that regard appeared
    contrived, guarded and apathetic. Nonetheless, I must be mindful that both
    general and specific denials, of necessity, would be lacking in detail and that
    the burden of proof never shifts to the accused. Also, that demeanour, while
    relevant, ought not to be unduly relied upon in assessing credibility. Although
    his denials were plausible, the delivery thereof did not constitute compelling
    evidence on the part of the accused that he was not guilty. The accused
    struggled in general with dates and details. There were a few inconsistencies
    such as [the complainant’s mother] not working at all or ever, but he later
    acknowledged that she was working when they met. These examples raised by the
    Crown were not, in my view, intended to mislead. Other than set out above, his
    evidence was generally ineffective, or at best, neutral.</span></p>

    out that he repeatedly denied the allegations that were put to him, giving
    simple answers to questions and not wavering throughout his testimony. The

    nature and delivery of his denials.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    judge’s reasons as indicating that he made improper use of the appellant’s
    demeanour when assessing his credibility. The trial judge noted that denials
    would necessarily be lacking in detail, that the burden never shifts to the
    accused, and that undue reliance should not be placed on demeanour. In the
    trial judge’s words, the appellant’s denials were “plausible”, but they were
    not “compelling.” Bearing in mind the requirements of </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>W.D.</span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>, we read
    the trial judge as saying that the appellant’s denials were, at best, of

    This court found that the trial judge relied on factors that could not
