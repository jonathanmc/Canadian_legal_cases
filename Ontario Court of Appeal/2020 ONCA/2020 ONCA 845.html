  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=s13><span style='line-height:100%;color:black'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=s13><span style='line-height:100%;color:black'>The
    appellant was the complainant’s grade seven French teacher in 2010-2011. The complainant
    alleged that at the end of grade seven, when he was 12 years old, the appellant
    engaged in indecent acts in his presence including masturbation and simulated
    sex with various objects and inviting the complainant to engage in a sex act.</span></span><span
style='line-height:100%'> When he was 19, t<span class=s13><span
style='color:black'>he complainant disclosed these events to his girlfriend,
    his mother and the police. The trial judge convicted the appellant of four
    counts of committing an indecent act and one count of sexual invitation to a
    person under 16 years of age and sentenced him to two years less a day. The
    appellant appeals the convictions and sentence. </span></span></span></p>

    appellant submits that the complainant’s evidence was incredible and unreliable
    and that the trial judge did not properly address it. The complainant had lied
    repeatedly to his mother and the police. The appellant submits that the
    complainant also lied while in court. </span></span><span style='line-height:
200%'>For example: when the complainant was in grade nine, the complainant lied
    to the police when he said there had been no sexual contact between him and the
    appellant; the complainant’s evidence on a vehicle accident in June 2011
    changed several times regarding who had been driving and what the complainant
    and the appellant had been doing at the time of the accident; and there were inconsistencies
    between the complainant’s testimony and the testimony of the complainant’s
    friend on the contents of a video. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge accepted the
    complainant’s explanation that he had lied to his mother and to the police
    because he was embarrassed by the appellant’s conduct and was afraid that he would
    be in trouble. Also, by the time the complainant testified at trial, more than
    six years had passed. The trial judge concluded that even though some details
    of his evidence changed, the complainant’s evidence about the essential
    elements of the offences did not. He found that the variations in the
    complainant’s evidence did not detract from his credibility or reliability.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge’s credibility
    findings are entitled to deference: <em>R. v. Dinardo</em>, 2008 SCC 24, [2008]
    1 S.C.R. 788, at para. 26. He was well aware of the inconsistencies, addressed
    them and accepted the complainant’s evidence. We see no reason to interfere. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The appellant further submits that
    the<span class=s13><span style='color:black'> trial judge failed to assess the
    complainant’s motive to fabricate in his reasons. The appellant submits that
    the complainant’s mother disliked the appellant, </span></span>and either the
    complainant was making the allegations to improve his relationship with his
    mother, or the mother encouraged false statements to the police. The appellant
    submits that it was an error for the trial judge not to address this theory in
    his reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge did not fail to
    consider the potential motive to fabricate. When defence counsel raised the
    theory in closing submissions, the trial judge questioned the relevance of the
    mother’s credibility. The trial judge agreed that that the mother had
    previously harboured animus toward the appellant but noted that there was no
    evidence that it continued. After reviewing the evidence with defence counsel, the
    trial judge concluded that the complainant’s mother was not coaching the
    complainant about what to tell the police or disclose, she was instead urging
    the complainant to tell the truth about what had happened. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The trial judge clearly found no evidence
    to support a motive to fabricate. This conclusion was open to him on the
    evidence and we do not accept that it was an error in principle not to address
    the issue in his reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=s13><span style='line-height:100%;color:black'>Finally,
    the appellant submits that </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>the<span
class=s13><span style='color:black'> trial judge misapplied the burden of proof
    by essentially requiring the appellant to dismantle the essential elements of
    the complainant’s allegations. He submits that </span></span>the trial judge
    accepted the complainant’s evidence uncritically. We do not agree. As we have
    set out above, the trial judge was aware of the issues the appellant now
    raises. He nonetheless accepted the evidence of the complainant. It was open to
    him to do so. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span style='line-height:100%'>The sentence</span></p>

    appellant appeals his sentence, alleging that the trial judge determined the
    sentence without reference to the appellant’s mental health. </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:100%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:100%'>The Crown sought a three-year
    sentence, while the appellant sought a sentence of nine months. The aggravating
    factors included a breach of trust, and that there were multiple incidents and
    extensive grooming behaviour. The mitigating factors were that the appellant
    did not have a criminal record, that he had support from family and friends,
    and his history of employment as a teacher since 1999, which was has ended
    because of the convictions. The victim impact statement from the complainant’s mother
    indicated that these offences had serious physical, emotional, and financial
    impacts on the complainant and his family. The trial judge also commented on the
    position of trust that the appellant was in as the complainant’s teacher and
    made a note of case law that emphasized the message that must be sent to
    offenders in that position. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
