    the Superior Court of Justice, dated September 27, 2019, with reasons reported
    at 2019 CarswellOnt 16957.</p>
  <p class=Judge><strong>Gillese J.A.:</strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>How is the habitual residence of a child to be
    determined, for the purpose of an application under the </span><em>Convention
    on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction</em><span lang=EN-US>,
    Can. T. S. 1983 No. 35 (</span><em>Hague Convention</em><span lang=EN-US>),
    when the parents assert competing claims of wrongful taking and retention of
    the child? That question lies at the heart of this appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>overview</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The child in question was born in Toronto and
    raised there by both parents until October 2018, when she was six months old. At
    that time, her mother took her to France. Four months later, in February 2019,
    the father travelled to France and brought the child back to Ontario. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The parents have very different versions of the
    circumstances in which the child was both taken to France and brought back to
    Ontario. Each says the other wrongfully took the child or wrongfully retained
    her or both.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The mother brought a </span><em>Hague Convention</em> <span lang=EN-US>application in Ontario (the Application) in which she alleged
    that the child was habitually resident in France in February 2019 and had been
    wrongfully removed to Canada. She asked the court to order that the child be returned
    to France. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge dismissed the Application.
    She found that the child was habitually resident in Canada until October 28,
    2018, when the parties’ relationship ended. She further found that the child’s habitual
    residence remained Canada, despite her having lived in France with her mother from
    mid-October 2018 to the end of February 2019. Because the child was not
    habitually resident in France in February 2019, the provisions of the </span><em>Hague
    Convention</em><span lang=EN-US> did not apply.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On appeal, the mother contends that the
    application judge’s decision offends the </span><em>Hague Convention</em> <span
lang=EN-US>and the principles set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in </span><em>Office
    of the Children’s Lawyer v. Balev</em><i><span lang=EN-US>,</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> 2018 SCC 16, </span>[2018] 1 S.C.R. 398. </p>

lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-US>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND IN Brief</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There were many factual disputes between the
    parties. In this section, I set out the relevant uncontested background facts and
    the positions that each party took on the Application. A full appreciation of
    the factual circumstances can be gained only by reading this section in
    conjunction with the application judge’s detailed factual findings, summarized
    in the following section.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Doriane Farsi (the appellant) is a French
    citizen. In January 2017, she was working (on a visa) as a waitress in Toronto when
    she met Pedro Da Rocha (the respondent). The respondent is a Portuguese citizen
    and a permanent resident of Canada. He lives in Toronto where he works as a
    roofer. He has a close relationship with his parents and his sister, all of
    whom also live in Toronto. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant and respondent began dating in May
    2017. From June 2017 to October 2018 they lived together, with the respondent’s
    parents, in the respondent’s parents’ home in Toronto. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In April 2018, the appellant and respondent had
    a child, M.D. Having been born in Canada, M.D. is a Canadian citizen. The
    parties jointly parented M.D. When they were working, the respondent’s mother cared
    for M.D.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In July 2018, the appellant took M.D. to France
    for a visit to meet her maternal relatives. During this time, the respondent saw
    M.D. regularly through Facebook Messenger. When the appellant and M.D. returned
    to Toronto in August 2018, the parties and their child continued to live with the
    respondent’s parents in their home and the paternal grandmother resumed her
    role as the child’s caregiver when the parties were working.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 14, 2018, the appellant travelled to
    France with M.D., where they remained until February 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 24, 2019, the respondent travelled
    to France. On February 28, 2019, he returned to Ontario with M.D. He and M.D. continue
    to live in Toronto. As before, they reside with his parents in their home and his
    mother cares for M.D. when he is working. The appellant continues to live in
    France.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In early May 2019, the appellant started a </span><em>Hague
    Convention</em> <span lang=EN-US>application in France seeking the child’s
    return. The Hague Central Authority in France sent a request for the child’s return
    to the Hague Central Authority in Ontario. When that request was refused, the appellant
    brought this Application, dated May 27, 2019, seeking the child’s return to France. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two events played a critical role in the Application’s
    determination: what happened in October 2018 when the appellant took the child
    to France and what happened in February 2019 when the respondent brought the
    child back to Ontario. The parties’ evidence on these two matters diverged
    dramatically. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s evidence on the Application </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant said she ended her relationship
    with the respondent when she returned to Toronto from France in August 2018 and
    that she relocated permanently to France, with the child, on October 14, 2018, with
    the respondent’s full knowledge and consent. Once in France, she and the
    respondent communicated regularly. He interacted with M.D. by video
    communication on almost a daily basis. She said that the respondent encouraged
    her to return to Toronto with M.D. so that they could continue living together
    as a family and sent her photographs of apartments he proposed to rent so they
    could move out from his parents’ home. She declined to return but encouraged
    him to travel to France to visit with M.D. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant said that the respondent made no
    commitment to visit France but arrived on short notice in February 2019 and
    asked to be allowed to take the child to Canada for a one-month vacation. She
    agreed and signed a pre-prepared travel consent form that he had brought with
    him. In her affidavit filed on the Application, it was alleged that she handwrote
    on the travel consent form that the child was to be returned to her in France
    at the end of the one-month vacation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant said that, at the end of March
    2019, the respondent refused to return M.D. to France. So, on April 6, 2019,
    she and her grandmother went to Toronto for the purpose of picking up M.D. and
    returning with her to France. While in Toronto, she was served with court
    documents from which she learned that the respondent was seeking sole custody
    of M.D. The following day, she met with legal counsel in Toronto. Arrangements
    were made so she could see M.D., but only after she surrendered her passport. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant returned to France and started a </span><em>Hague
    Convention</em><span lang=EN-US> application there. The French authorities requested
    the child’s return to France. When the respondent ignored that request, she
    commenced this Application. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the Application, the appellant alleged that when
    the respondent removed the child from France on February 28, 2019, he falsely
    indicated that he was taking the child for a one-month vacation in Ontario, and
    that since the one-month period expired in March 28, 2019, the respondent had wrongfully
    retained the child in Canada.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s evidence on the Application</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent said that the appellant took M.D.
    to France on October 14, 2018, with his consent, for a two-week visit to sign documentation
    relating to her grandmother’s inheritance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When the appellant told him in a video chat on
    October 28, 2018, that she would not return to Canada with the child, he
    immediately hired a lawyer and started an application under the </span><em>Hague
    Convention</em><span lang=EN-US> for the return of the child to Canada. Through
    this application, he sought the assistance of the Hague Central Authority in
    Ontario and in France in securing M.D.’s return to Ontario. The French
    authority requested additional documentation about the child’s habitual
    residence, including M.D.’s medical records. He and his lawyer began taking
    steps to obtain the requested documentation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent said that from November 2018 to
    January 2019, the appellant frequently complained about caring for M.D. and told
    him that he could come to France to pick up M.D. However, the appellant would
    not confirm a date for M.D.’s return to him. In January 2019, the appellant agreed
    to return M.D. to his care in Toronto. He flew to France on February 24, 2019
    to pick up M.D. The appellant gave him M.D.’s passport and signed a travel
    consent form, prepared in advance by his lawyer, which allowed M.D. to return
    to Toronto with him in February or March 2019. He said that the appellant did
    not handwrite anything on the travel consent form or indicate that M.D. was to
    be returned to her in France after one month. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent and M.D. flew back to Canada on
    February 28, 2019. M.D. has been in his sole care since then. He and M.D. continue
    to reside with his parents in their home and his mother cares for M.D. when he is
    working. He and M.D. have a strong and loving relationship with his parents and
    his sister. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Once back in Toronto with M.D., the respondent instructed
    his lawyer to advise the Hague Central Authority in Ontario of M.D.’s return. His
    application was subsequently closed. In early April 2019, the respondent started
    custody proceedings in Ontario, seeking sole custody of M.D. He did so, in part,
    because he feared that the appellant would come to Toronto, abduct M.D., and take

    2017 to October 2018, with the respondent’s parents in the parents’ home. M.D.
    was born in April 2018 and is a Canadian citizen. The appellant took a
    three-month maternity leave and then returned to work as a waitress. The
    respondent continued to work full-time as a roofer. The parties jointly
    parented M.D. after her birth in April 2018 and jointly exercised the rights of
    custody. Both shared the responsibilities of caring for M.D., including
    changing diapers, and bathing, feeding, and playing with her. M.D.’s paternal
    grandmother assisted with childcare when the parties were working. The
    relationship between the appellant and the paternal grandmother was strained (paras.

    appointment was on October 11, 2018, three days before the appellant relocated
    to France with her. Nothing in the clinical notes and records suggests that the
    appellant indicated that she was relocating with M.D. to France. On the
    contrary, the notes show that the nurse discussed an optional 9-month visit and
    a 12-month visit, which are consistent with M.D. remaining in Canada (paras.

    spousal sponsorship process so that the appellant could obtain permanent
    resident status in Canada. They collected letters of support and, in August
    2018, the appellant requested and obtained her criminal records from France for
    the purpose of that process. The appellant applied for an Ontario driver’s

    text the following day in which she wrote “OK sleep well then kiss love u” to
    which the respondent replied “I love you too babe”; and various “kiss” texts
    exchanged by the parties in the period around October 14. Nor is the assertion consistent
    with the evidence of the parties’ search for an apartment to rent in Toronto. The
    parties were looking at apartments before the appellant left on October 14 so that
    they could move out from the paternal grandparents’ home. The respondent
    continued the search in the initial period after the appellant left for France.

    lack of information about M.D.’s life, ties and circumstances in the period

    being in France with the appellant for the two- week period from October 14 to

    had been living in France for four months, with the appellant, before the
    respondent took her back to Ontario. However, as I have noted, there was a
    paucity of evidence on M.D.’s circumstances and ties in the four-month period.</span></p>

    rejected the appellant’s argument that she was obliged to find that, on
    February 28, 2019, M.D.’s habitual residence was France because for an infant,
    the focal point of the infant’s life is who looked after her and in the
    four-month period leading up to February 28, that was the appellant. In the
    circumstances of this case, this was not a palpable and overriding error.</span></p>

    Up until October 28, 2018, she enjoyed the care of both of her parents. She had
    a close relationship with her paternal grandparents, who cared for her when the
    parents could not. M.D. also had a primary care physician in Toronto, with whom
    she had regular appointments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There was no similar evidence about M.D.’s life,
    ties and circumstances in the four-month period between October 2018 and
    February 2019. The only evidence the appellant provided on these matters was the
    bald statement that M.D. lived with her during that time. She gave no evidence
    about where she and M.D. were living or with whom, where the appellant was working
    (if she was working at all), or whether M.D. was involved with the appellant’s extended
    family. The only evidence on the last point came from the respondent’s
    affidavit in which he set out his limited understanding that the maternal
    grandmother may have been involved in M.D.’s care.  </span></p>

    this matter (see paras. 12, 49-52). She found that as of October 28, 2018, M.D.’s
    habitual residence was Canada. The paucity of evidence on M.D.’s ties and
    circumstances in France between then and February 28, 2019, led the application

lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s evidence was that she returned

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge found that the appellant
    returned to full-time employment when M.D. was three months old (the first
    finding). She also found that the appellant vacationed in France, with M.D.,
    from July 14 to August 24, 2018 (the second finding). At that time, the
    appellant says, M.D. was three months old.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the first finding is
    inconsistent with the second and must be the result of a palpable and
    overriding error. How could M.D. both be three months old when the appellant
    returned to work and three months old when she was away with M.D. on vacation
    in France? She also submits that the application judge made the first finding
    because she accepted the respondent’s evidence as credible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    a palpable and overriding error in making the first finding. As I explain
    above, a palpable and overriding error is one that is clearly wrong,
    unreasonable, or not reasonably supported on the evidence. The first finding is
    none of those things. However, even if the application judge did make such an
    error, it does not rise to the level required for appellate intervention,
    namely, that the error was “determinative of the outcome of the case”. This was
    but one of a host of considerations that went into the application judge’s
    determination of M.D.’s habitual residence. As I explain above, this court
    cannot intervene unless there is an obvious error that is determinative of the
    outcome.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I also reject the appellant’s second submission on
    this ground of appeal: that the application judge accepted the respondent’s
    evidence simply because she found the respondent credible. Respectfully, this fundamentally
    misstates the way in which the application judge approached the task of making findings
    of fact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On every key issue, the application judge set
    out the main conflicts in the evidence of the parties. She then gave careful,
    detailed reasons explaining her finding on the issue and why she made it. Importantly,
    the application judge thoroughly canvassed all the evidence on each such issue,
    including the independent evidence of third parties and contemporary
    documentation. Her findings are solidly grounded in the totality of evidence
    before her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One example is sufficient to demonstrate that
    this was the application judge’s approach to fact finding. The appellant said that
    she ended her relationship with the respondent in August 2018 when she returned
    to Toronto from vacationing in France. The respondent said that their
    relationship ended on October 28, 2018, when the appellant told him that she
    was staying in France with M.D. and not returning to Toronto.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge set out the competing
    versions of when the parties’ relationship ended. She then examined what
    happened in August 2018 after the appellant returned to Toronto. She referred
    to the independent evidence verifying the steps that the parties took in that
    period for the appellant to become a permanent resident of Canada and their search
    for apartments to rent. She also considered M.D.’s medical records, which showed
    no evidence that the appellant was going to relocate to France. The application
    judge also looked at the luggage that the appellant took with her when she left
    on October 14, a matter discussed more fully below. Further, she considered the
    text messages that the parties exchanged between October 14 and 28, 2018 – contemporaneous
    documentary evidence. Finally, she considered the evidence of what transpired
    after October 28, including the text messages exchanged between the two parties
    and the timing of the respondent’s </span><em>Hague Convention</em><span
lang=EN-US> application. Only after considering and weighing all of that
    evidence, did the application judge come to the conclusion that the parties’
    relationship ended on October 28, 2018.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the result, it is correct to say that the application
    judge largely accepted the respondent’s version of events – but it is not
    correct to say that she did so simply because she found him credible. As the
    application judge explains at para. 41 of the reasons, she preferred the
    respondent’s evidence on the key issues because the appellant’s evidence
    suffered from numerous inconsistencies and significant critical omissions. It
    was also contradicted by contemporaneous documents and other independent
    evidence. </span></p>

    para. 32 of the reasons, the application judge relied on the sister’s affidavit:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-US>I find that [the appellant] took two
