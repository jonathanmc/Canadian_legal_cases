  <p class=Onappealfrom><b>Zarnett J.A.:</b></p>
  <h1><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Introduction</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals the summary judgment that dismissed
    her action against the respondent as having been commenced after the applicable
    limitation period expired. The resolution of the appeal turns on how the
    limitation period under s. 4 of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em>, S.O. 2002,
    c. 24, Sched. B,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> when the claims arise from a
    series of oppressive acts alleged to have occurred at different times.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant’s principal submission is that
    even if some of the oppressive acts or omissions complained of in her statement
    of claim were discoverable more than two years before she commenced her action,
    one of them was not, namely the dissolution of the corporation in which the
    appellant held shares without any authorization from its shareholders or any
    notice to her. She submits that because of this her action, or at least the
    claim about the corporate dissolution, ought to have been allowed to continue
    to trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the appellant that the corporate
    dissolution claim was not statute barred. However, the motion judge’s
    conclusion was correct with respect to the other claims in the action – they are
    statute barred. I would therefore allow the appeal in part.</span></p>
  <h1><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Facts</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>2102097 Ontario Inc. (the “Corporation”) was
    incorporated in May 2006 pursuant to the <em>OBCA</em>. It carried on a dry
    cleaning business under the name ‘Perfect Cleaner’ from rented premises on
    Mount Pleasant Road in Toronto. The respondent and two other individuals were
    its original shareholders. The respondent owned 42.59% of the shares, Mr. Bing
    Wang owned 17.59%, and a third shareholder owned 39.81%.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant purchased the third shareholder’s
    shares, representing a 39.81% interest in the Corporation, for $104,000 in
    February 2010.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On February 12, 2010, the appellant, the
    respondent, and Mr. Wang, met and reached a number of agreements, including the
    following:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant had a 39.81% ownership interest in Perfect Cleaner and would assume
    responsibilities for quality control and human resources;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent had a 42.59% ownership interest in Perfect Cleaner and would serve
    as President and Director. He would be responsible for running the day to day
    operations of the business, including the responsibility of handling all
    financial matters, in the interest of and for the benefit of all owners;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third owner, Mr. Wang, had a 17.59% ownership interest in Perfect Cleaner;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant would have “voting rights, receipt of dividends and entitlement to
    the value of Perfect Cleaner upon event of its dissolution or winding up”;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant would be paid wages for her work at the business;</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    consent of 50% or more of the shareholders would be required to pass
    resolutions; and</p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    three shareholders “expressed an intention to sell the business for $250,000 – $300,000,
    if such an offer ever became available.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant did not receive back any part of her
    investment. She received no dividends or other payments.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In June 2010, the respondent was charged with
    assault and uttering a death threat against the appellant. As a result, the
    appellant did not attend Perfect Cleaner’s premises until the respondent signed
    a peace bond in March 2011. Between March and August 2011, the appellant
    regularly attended and checked on the business. Although she testified that the
    business seemed to be operating normally and she did not see any indication of issues
    or problems, the motion judge noted that there were contrary indications.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In June and July 2011, the respondent told the
    appellant that he had stopped paying rent on the premises because the business
    could not afford it. In the summer of 2011, a representative of the landlord also
    told the appellant that rent was in arrears. The appellant testified that she
    did not believe the respondent or the landlord.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In July 2011, the appellant was told by the
    respondent of a proposed sale of the business for $20,000 to which she agreed,
    subject to Mr. Wang being consulted. She heard nothing further about the proposed
    sale. The motion judge observed that it made little sense for the appellant to
    have agreed to such a sale unless there were financial difficulties in the
    business.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 3, 2011, the appellant attended
    Perfect Cleaner’s premises. She found a new dry cleaning business operating
    there under a different name. The person in charge of the new business, described
    by the appellant as the “new owner”, told her he had purchased the business
    from the landlord.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In her affidavit, the appellant testified that
    she was “confused and shocked” by this development. She deposed to a list of
    things that she thought might have occurred consistent with her still receiving
    value from the business including, for example, the business having moved locations
    or having entered into a sublease. However, none of these possibilities were
    based on anything the respondent, with whom she did not communicate, told her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Between September and December 2011, the
    appellant inquired of friends about what she could do to find out what happened
    to her business. In February 2012, she learned that she could obtain a corporate
    profile report. On February 25, 2012, she obtained one that revealed the
    respondent had filed Articles of Dissolution for the Corporation on October 12,
    2011. The appellant had not given consent to a corporate dissolution.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, in December 2011, the appellant was
    directed by the Canada Revenue Agency to pay tax on a dividend she allegedly
    received from Perfect Cleaner, although she had received no such dividend. In
    January 2012, she sued the respondent in Small Claims Court and obtained
    judgment against him for the amount of the alleged dividend ($2,883).</span></p>
  <h1><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Action</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On October 31, 2013, the appellant commenced
    this action claiming damages, punitive damages, and an accounting and tracing
    of revenues and sale proceeds generated by the Corporation. The statement of claim
    references various legal theories including breach of contract, breach of
    trust, unjust enrichment, and the oppression remedy in the <em>OBCA. </em>The
    argument before us proceeded on the oppression remedy basis and there was no
    suggestion the limitation period analysis would be more favorable to the appellant
    if another legal theory were considered. Accordingly, I approach the matter on
    the basis that the oppression remedy is the theory on which the appellant is
    proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The statement of claim essentially pleads three
    acts or omissions of the respondent that underpin the claims alleged:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the respondent unilaterally dissolved the business without the approval,
    authority, or knowledge of the appellant (the “corporate dissolution claim”);</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the respondent failed to pay proceeds of any sale or transfer of the
    business, including the value of any assets owned by the business at the time
    of the sale or transfer, to the appellant (the “sale claim”); and</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumber>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the respondent failed to account for or pay any profits of the business
    to the appellant since June 2010 (the “profits distribution claim”).</p>
  <h1><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>IV.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Motion Judge’s Decision</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent moved successfully for summary
    judgment on the sole basis that the action was brought after the expiration of
    the applicable limitation period and was thus statute barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence before the motion judge disclosed
    factual disputes about the merits of the appellant’s claims. For example, the
    respondent disputed that an unauthorized sale was the reason Perfect Cleaner
    was not operating from its premises as of September 3, 2011. He asserted the
    business had been forced to close for financial reasons. In reaching her
    conclusion that summary judgment should be granted, the motion judge found the
    record to be sufficient to make the necessary findings of fact and apply the
    law to them to decide the limitation period issue. She considered the factual
    issues that were in dispute to be irrelevant to the limitation period issue. Essentially,
    she considered the limitations issue on the assumption that the appellant would
    be able to prove the facts she alleges to support her claims.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge applied the test in s. 5(1) of
    the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> to the question of when the appellant’s
    claims were discovered or ought to have been discovered.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a> She found that by September 3,
    2011, the appellant knew or ought to have known that she had suffered injury,
    loss, or damage because she knew at that point that Perfect Cleaner was gone, a
    new dry cleaning business with new owners was operating at the premises, and
    she had received no money from any sale or transfer of the business or any
    dividends from Perfect Cleaner’s operations. She also knew or ought to have
    known by that date that the injury, loss, or damage was caused by or
    contributed to by the respondent’s acts or omissions because he was responsible

    had been dismissed on a limitation period basis. The motion judge had found
    that there was oppressive conduct discoverable more than two years before the
    application was commenced. This court reversed the decision, holding that since
    there was oppressive conduct complained of that occurred within two years of
    the commencement of the application, the claim could continue with respect to
    that later conduct.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In so concluding, the court held that s. 4 of
    the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> applies to claims under the <em>OBCA</em> oppression remedy, and therefore, an action for oppression must be commenced within
    two years of the discovery of a potential claim for oppression: at paras. 3 and
    43. In considering how that rule applied when oppressive conduct is alleged to
    have occurred over a period of time, the court noted a divergence of case law
    regarding the application of the limitation period to cases of “ongoing
    oppression”: at paras. 36-42. But on the facts, the court held that the series
    of oppressive acts complained of did not constitute “ongoing oppression”, and accordingly,
    it was not necessary to define the exact limitation period consequence of a
    finding of “ongoing oppression”. What the court did establish is the approach to
    be followed where singular discrete oppressive acts committed at various times are
    alleged.</span></p>

    for the proposition that where what is complained of is a series of singular discrete
    acts of oppression over a period of time, claims arising from the acts committed
    or discoverable within two years of the action are not statute barred, even if
    the series of acts commenced, and claims for earlier oppressive acts in the
    series were discoverable, more than two years prior to the commencement of the action.
    A later oppressive act, even if based on or in furtherance of earlier
    oppressive acts, gives rise to a new cause of action because it is new
    oppressive conduct: at paras. 3 and 50-54.</span></p>

    it follows that claims arising from singular discrete acts of oppression (in a series
    of such acts) that are discoverable more than two years before an action are
    statute barred. As a result, a series of singular discrete acts of oppression that
    stretches over a period of time may result in some claims for oppression
    arising from earlier acts in the series being statute barred while claims arising

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the approach in <em>Maurice </em>applies
    because, as was the case there, what is alleged here are singular discrete
    oppressive acts, rather than “ongoing oppression”. I reach that conclusion for
    the following reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A failure to distribute profits is the alleged
    act that underpins the profits distribution claim. It is said to have occurred beginning
    in June 2010. A different act, an unauthorized transfer or sale of the business
    without at the time of sale accounting for the proceeds, is the alleged act that
    underpins the sale claim. That act is said to have occurred sometime before
    September 3, 2011. A still different act, the unauthorized dissolution of the
    Corporation, is the alleged act that underpins the corporate dissolution claim.
    It occurred in October 2011.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These are each singular discrete oppressive
    acts, because they are different acts occurring at different times and because none
    of them is dependent upon either of the others having happened for oppression
    to be said to have occurred. If the respondent had failed to distribute profits
    but neither transferred the business nor dissolved the Corporation, the
    appellant would, upon discovery, have had an oppression claim for failure to
    distribute profits. Similarly, if the respondent had only sold the business and
    kept sale proceeds, or if he had only dissolved the Corporation, the appellant
    would still have an oppression claim for these singular discrete acts, even if
    none of the others occurred. As<em> Maurice</em> points out, conduct may
    consist of singular discrete acts of oppression even where  the later
    oppressive conduct was based on or in furtherance of the earlier oppressive conduct:
    at paras. 3 and 48-54.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Against this backdrop, I turn to the effect of
    the date of the corporate dissolution, and when it was discovered and
    discoverable, on the motion judge’s conclusions. I agree with the respondent
    that neither the date of the corporate dissolution, nor when it was or ought to
    have been discovered, entails the conclusion that the <em>entire</em> action
    should have been viewed as commenced within the limitation period and not
    statute barred.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge noted the appellant’s evidence
    that it was only upon learning, in February 2012, that the respondent had filed
    Articles of Dissolution that she realized that he was no longer operating
    Perfect Cleaner for the interest of the three owners. The motion judge’s
    findings implicitly reject this evidence in so far as it was advanced to
    support the view that <em>none</em> of the three claims in the action were
    statute barred. Even though the motion judge did not deal with whether the
    dissolution was a singular discrete act of oppression occurring after September
    3, 2011, the failure to do so does not undermine her conclusion to the extent
    it applies to the discoverability, more than two years before the action was
    commenced, of the sale claim and the profits distribution claim.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motion judge appropriately focused on the
    facts of which the appellant was aware as of September 3, 2011. By then she was
    aware that Perfect Cleaner was no longer operating out of its leased premises
    and a new owner was operating a similar business from its premises. The
    appellant had been provided with no explanation by, or had given no authority
    to, the respondent, who had handled the Corporation’s day to day operations and
    all financial matters, for any of that to occur. By September 3, 2011, the
    appellant was also aware that she had not received payments of any of
    Corporation’s profits. The motion judge was entitled to find, from these facts,
    that the sale claim and the profits distribution claim were discoverable by
    September 3, 2011.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That the sale claim and the profits distribution
    claim are founded on discrete acts of oppression serves to rebut the contention
    that they were only discoverable when the later alleged oppressive act, the
    dissolution of the Corporation, occurred. The appellant did not need to know
    that the Corporation was dissolved to discover that she had a potential claim for
    oppression for an improper transfer or sale of the business, or a potential claim
    for oppression for a failure to pay profits. Whether the Corporation continued
    to exist or not, the sale claim and the profits distribution claim were
    actionable. The limitation period is not extended for acts of oppression that
    are actionable in themselves simply because a later singular discrete act of
    oppression occurs. As <em>Maurice </em>provides: “Courts must be careful not to
    convert singular oppressive acts into ongoing oppression claims in an effort to
    extend limitation periods. To do so would create a special rule for oppression
    remedy claims”: at para. 49.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor is the limitation period extended because a complainant
    hopes that the oppression will be remedied: <em>Maurice</em>, at paras. 46-49. The
    motion judge was correct to focus on the alleged failure of the respondent to
    distribute profits and the alleged acts or omissions that resulted in the
    business not operating from its premises, which were known to the appellant as
    of September 3, 2011. And the motion judge was entitled to not give effect to
    the appellant’s assertions that she hoped to find, notwithstanding that the
    business had been closed without notice or explanation, the business operating
    elsewhere or that the respondent’s failure to account for profits or any sale
    proceeds might be remedied. This is not a case where the possibilities the
    appellant adverted to were based upon anything represented to her by the
    respondent on or after September 3, 2011.</span></p>

    appellant’s claims were discoverable – that the appellant knew or ought to have
    known of the elements in s. 5(1) of the <em>Limitations Act, 2002</em> in
    respect of them – and that they should be dismissed as statute barred, should
    stand in respect to the sale claim and profits distribution claim. It was
    grounded in the record and is not the product of any legal error. It is entitled

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s argument is rebutted by the
    holding in <em>Maurice </em>that where a party engages in a series of
    oppressive acts, singular discrete oppressive acts occurring or only

    barred: <em>Maurice</em>, at paras. 3 and 50-53. The court in <em>Maurice</em> explained
    why this is so at paras. 52 and 54:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote>A party that engages in a series of oppressive acts can always
    make the argument that it is all part of the same corporate malfeasance and
    that the limitation period begins to run with the discovery of the first
    oppressive act. In analyzing that conduct, courts must have regard to the
    remedial nature of the oppression remedy and the fact that any threatened or
    actual conduct that is oppressive, or unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly
    disregards the interests of any complainant can constitute a discrete claim of
    oppression. The oppression remedy section of the <a
href="https://www.canlii.org/en/on/laws/stat/rso-1990-c-b16/latest/rso-1990-c-b16.html"><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>OBCA</span></a> is drafted in the
    broadest possible terms to respond to the broadest range of corporate
    malfeasance. </p>
  <p class=CQuote>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The practical effect of … [such an argument] is that where a
    party is alleged to have acted in an oppressive manner and no oppression remedy
    application is commenced as a consequence, he or she is free to take additional
    oppressive steps in furtherance of, or based upon, the initial oppressive conduct.
    That reasoning is contrary to the broad purposive interpretation that must be
    afforded this statutory cause of action: see <em>BCE Inc. v. 1976
