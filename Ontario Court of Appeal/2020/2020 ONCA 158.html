  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of a single count of
    sexual assault after a jury trial in the Superior Court of Justice. He was
    sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years less credit for
    pre-disposition custody. The net sentence imposed was three years, seven
    months. He appeals both conviction and sentence. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Background Facts </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and complainant met when both were
    attending alcohol treatment programs at a local addiction and mental health
    facility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Several weeks after the conclusion of their
    respective programs, the complainant lost a big project in her chosen field.
    She relapsed and drank steadily for a week. She recognized ultimately that she
    needed to go to a detox centre. After unsuccessful attempts to enlist the
    assistance of two friends, she called the appellant. He agreed to help her. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the appellant arrived at the complainant’s
    apartment, the complainant’s dog-walker was also there. The appellant told the
    dog-walker that she could leave. He would make dinner for the complainant and
    then take care of her. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>According to the complainant, the appellant
    approached her as she was lying on the couch. He got on top of her. He said he
    always found her “hot and incredibly sexy”. Despite her resistance, the
    appellant removed the complainant’s pants, performed oral sex upon her and then
    had intercourse with her, during which he ejaculated. He did not wear a condom. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified. He said that the sexual
    activity between them was consensual. He offered to wear a condom or to
    withdraw before ejaculation, but the complainant declined his offers. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeal from Conviction</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the appeal from conviction, the appellant
    advances two grounds of appeal. Each has to do with events that took place
    after the sexual intercourse. More particularly, each concerns the use the trial
    judge instructed the jury they could make of the evidence of those events. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #1: The Examination and Treatment Evidence </span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury heard evidence that the complainant
    attended at a local hospital where a nurse completed a sexual assault
    examination kit, and a report detailing her findings. The complainant also
    undertook a month-long prophylactic treatment program (PEP) during which she
    experienced very unpleasant side effects. The purpose of this program was to
    ensure that the unprotected intercourse did not result in any sexually
    transmitted diseases. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In her instructions to the jury, the trial judge
    explained how this evidence could be used in reaching a verdict. She said: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>You will recall that [B.C.] testified that she
    underwent a sexual assault examination at Women’s College Hospital as she was
    concerned because the sexual assault was unprotected. As part of her treatment,
    swabs were taken vaginally and medication was prescribed to prevent infectious
    diseases. She testified that the symptoms from the medication made her
    physically ill for a month, but she took it all the way through. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It has long been held that post-event demeanour
    of a sexual assault victim can be used as circumstantial evidence to
    corroborate the complainant’s version of events. When assessing the credibility
    of [B.C.], you may find that her testimony regarding her willingness to undergo
    an invasive sexual assault examination corroborates her version of events. It
    is up to you. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the evidence that the complainant
    reported to hospital, had administered a sexual assault examination kit, and
    later followed a post-exposure prophylactic treatment program (PEP), was
    relevant and admissible at trial. While the use of the language “corroborates”
    the testimony of the complainant was ill-chosen, we are not persuaded that its
    inclusion caused the appellant any prejudice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, there was a significant body of
    evidence that described the complainant’s physical and emotional condition
    after the appellant had left her apartment. That this evidence was not
    marshalled in support of the complainant’s claim enured to the benefit of the
    appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, in this case, the PEP evidence had
    some significant probative value in that, according to the appellant, the
    complainant had declined two offers from the appellant to protect herself from
    sexually transmitted diseases. In these circumstances, it seems unlikely that,
    having foregone those offers, she would willingly submit to a regimen of
    medication that she described variously as “dreadful”, “unbelievable” and “horrific”. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is also not without significance that trial
    counsel was content with what the trial judge proposed to say about this
    evidence before the charge was delivered and raised no objection thereafter. </span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #2: The Text</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second ground of appeal against conviction
    relates to the trial judge’s instructions to the jury about their use of a text
    the appellant sent to the complainant when he learned that he would be charged
    with sexual assault. This evidence was admitted in the defence case without any
    adjudication on its admissibility. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The principal complaint in this court is that in
    her instructions to the jury, the trial judge left the issue of spontaneity to
    the jury when this issue had already been decided because the evidence had been
    admitted. In this case, it would have been preferable had trial counsel sought
    a ruling on admissibility in advance of tendering the text message. However,
    once the evidence had been admitted, trial counsel made use of it in closing
    address. We are not persuaded that the jury instructions about its use
    prejudiced the appellant in any way. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Appeal from Sentence</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the appeal from sentence, the appellant says
    that the trial judge erred by concluding that the offence involved a breach of
    trust. Although this was not a traditional trust relationship, it is clear that
    the complainant sought the appellant’s assistance in getting to a detox
    facility. The appellant undertook to do so. At the very least, he took
    advantage of a vulnerable person whom he knew required help. This attracted
    denunciation and deterrence as the paramount sentencing objectives. What is
    more, the sentence imposed was well within the range of sentences applicable to
