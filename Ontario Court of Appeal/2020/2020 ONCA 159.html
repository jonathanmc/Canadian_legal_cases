  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, a former fashion photographer,
    was charged with six counts of sexual assault and one count of sexual
    exploitation of four young women whom he had photographed, namely, C.K., A.R.,
    C.A., and N.H.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before trial, the appellant applied to sever the
    charges and have them tried separately. The application judge severed only the
    charge involving N.H., which alleged the appellant had briefly touched N.H.’s
    breasts without her consent during a photography session. He permitted a joint
    trial of the more serious allegations involving the other complainants, which alleged
    non-consensual vaginal touching, digital penetration, and penile penetration:
    see <em>R. v. R.C.</em>, 2016 ONSC 6593.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge later allowed the Crown to adduce
    similar fact evidence across the counts involving C.K., A.R., and C.A.: see <em>R.
    v. R.C.</em>, 2016 ONSC 7575.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The jury acquitted the appellant of the charge
    involving C.A., but convicted him of those involving C.K. and A.R. He was
    sentenced to 51-months’ imprisonment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant now appeals against his conviction
    and sentence. He raises four grounds of appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge erred in refusing to sever
    the charges involving C.A., C.K., and A.R.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge erred in granting the Crown’s
    cross-count similar fact evidence application.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s jury charge failed to relate
    the evidence to the issues and to provide a proper instruction on the
    principles of <em>R. v. W.(D.)</em>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The 51-month sentence imposed for a first-time
    offender violated the totality and parity principles and was demonstrably
    unfit. The trial judge also erred by relying on an aggravating factor that had
    not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both
    the conviction and sentence appeals.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></h1>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.K. moved to Toronto in 2009 at the age of 18
    to pursue a modelling career. She met the appellant, who was 34 at the time, through
    K.R., a more experienced model who had worked with the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.K. attended several photoshoots at the
    appellant’s studio in 2009 and 2010. At the first shoot, K.R. was initially present,
    as was another photographer, S.L., who shared the appellant’s studio at the
    time. C.K. testified that after K.R. and S.L. left, the appellant persuaded her
    to pose in a so-called “Calvin Klein” implied-nude style, in which the model
    poses topless but covers her breasts with her arms or hands. She testified that
    the appellant said that all the best models pose topless, even though C.K.’s
    modelling agency did not require such shots. C.K. posed topless at several photoshoots.
    The appellant told her to undress and wear a robe while at the studio to avoid clothing
    impressions on her skin.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.K. claimed that the appellant sexually
    assaulted her three times.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, during a photoshoot in 2010, the
    appellant told her to think about sex, placed his hand under her robe, and
    digitally penetrated her vagina. C.K. testified that she did not want to be
    touched like this, but she did not object because she was concerned about how
    the appellant might react and whether he would hurt her career.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, a few weeks later, during another
    photoshoot, the appellant grabbed C.K. and fondled her breasts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, in April 2010, during her final
    photoshoot with the appellant, the appellant approached C.K. from behind,
    pushed her over a table, and had vaginal intercourse with her without her
    consent. Afraid that he would hurt her if she resisted, C.K. just closed her
    eyes and tried not to cry. After this, C.K. never worked with the appellant
    again.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.K. testified that some time later she sent the
    appellant an angry email, saying that she had trusted him and he should not
    have done that to her. She testified that the appellant wrote back something like,
    “I thought that you wanted it”; she responded, “Are you kidding?” C.K. stated
    that she had deleted the emails as it had never occurred to her that she would
    require them for anything.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A year or so later, C.K. saw the appellant at a
    fashion show and told her boyfriend that the appellant had sexually assaulted
    her. Her boyfriend encouraged her to go to the police, but she was not ready to

    who had made allegations against the appellant. She was contacted by S.L., the
    photographer who had shared the appellant’s studio, who suggested that if

    asked her boyfriend to leave. He then gave her a robe and told her to remove
    her top and bra. He had already told her that he required models to remove
    their clothes and put on a robe to avoid visible clothing lines. He then asked
    her to pose topless. A.R. was uncomfortable, but did as she was told. She assumed

    touched her vagina and digitally penetrated her. She testified, “I was scared
    for my life. It shocked me. I didn’t know what was happening.” She said the
    appellant told her he could help her succeed, just as he had helped K.R., whom
    he said he had also touched sexually. A.R. thought about trying to leave, but
    was afraid the appellant might hurt her or assault her again. She testified
    that the shoot ended when the appellant encouraged her to touch herself but she
    refused. He then forced open her legs and touched her where her pelvis and leg
    join. A.R. insisted that the appellant never asked if he could touch her
    sexually and she never consented to him doing so.</span></p>

    serious allegations made by N.H. with the very severe allegations made by the
    other three complainants. The application judge also reasoned that the

    application. He considered the appellant’s arguments that the cases had no
    unifying threads and that trying them together would come “perilously close to
    saying that he is the type of person to take advantage of his position”.
    Nevertheless, the application judge reasonably concluded that the Crown had a
    viable similar fact application because all the offences alleged very similar
    conduct in very similar circumstances. He was also entitled to conclude that
    there was “nothing unduly prejudicial” about trying the C.K., A.R., and C.A.
    cases together. It was not necessary for the application judge to go into
    further specifics about the sources of prejudice, and it is clear from reading
    his reasons as a whole that he was alive to the risk of prejudice and considered
    it in the course of his analysis: see <em>Blacklaws</em>, at para. 52. Deference

    the application judge relied on evidence of alleged collusion to support the
    viability of the Crown’s similar fact application. Rather, when the application
    judge’s reasons are read in context, it is clear that he relied on the allegation
    of collusion among C.A., A.R., and C.K. as a characteristic distinguishing those
    charges from the charges in respect of N.H., where there was no allegation of collusion.

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the application judge
    erred in his assessment of prejudice on the severance application in three
    ways.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant submits that the
    application judge erred in relying on the similarity of the allegations in
    concluding that “there is nothing unduly prejudicial about trying the [three]
    cases together.” The appellant asserts that the “similarity of the allegation
    is precisely what creates prejudice in the circumstances”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree with the contention that the
    application judge erred in considering the similarity of the allegations. In
    this case, that similarity supported the viability of the similar fact
    application. Such an application, if ultimately granted at trial, would
    specifically permit the jury to consider the evidence of all three complainants
    across counts. Where a proposed similar fact application is viable at the time
    of the severance application, this may provide a sufficient reason for deciding
    to deal with potential prejudice at a later stage of the proceedings, including
    through appropriate jury instructions: see <em>Waudby</em>, at para. 8.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant submits that the
    application judge erred in his assessment of prejudice because he did not
    address any of the specific types of prejudice discussed by the Supreme Court
    in <em>Last —</em> i.e., the risk that the complainants’ credibility would be
    impermissibly bolstered, the risk that the appellant’s credibility would be
    impermissibly undermined, and the risk that the jury would engage in propensity
    reasoning. The appellant makes the same argument in relation to the application
    judge’s conclusion about the viability of the similar fact application.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I stated above, it was not necessary for the
    application judge to go into further specifics about the sources of prejudice. He
    explicitly mentioned the risk of propensity reasoning and it is clear from his
    reasons that he was alive to the risk of prejudice generally and considered it
    in the course of his analysis. Deference is owed to his ultimate conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellant submits that the
    application judge erred in his assessment of prejudice because he
    misapprehended the evidence about the differences between the three cases.
    Specifically, the appellant takes issue with the application judge’s statement
    that the three complainants “were looking to the [appellant] for professional guidance
    and an initiation into their modelling careers, but what they got was an
    initiation into coerced<em> sex</em>” (emphasis added). The appellant submits
    that this statement reveals a misapprehension of the evidence, because only

    context of the severance decision as a whole, the reference here to “coerced <em>sex</em>”

    did not act unjudicially in refusing severance. He did not err in concluding
    that the Crown had a viable similar fact argument or in concluding that trying

    application, the appellant himself submitted that he planned to testify in
    defence to the charges involving C.K., A.R., and C.A., and argued that this was
    a reason to sever the charge involving N.H. The application judge severed that
    charge but refused to sever what remained. At trial, the appellant unsuccessfully
    opposed the similar fact application. Then, he chose to testify. In the
    circumstances, it cannot be said that he was “forced” to testify in his own
    defence, when he had previously announced that he planned to testify and then decided
    to do so based on how the trial unfolded. Moreover, the jury acquitted the
    appellant of the charge involving C.A., despite the admission of the similar
    fact evidence of C.K. and A.R., which suggests that the jury did not engage in
    forbidden propensity reasoning, and did not assume that the appellant was
    unbelievable with respect to all of the allegations just because he was
    unbelievable with respect to some of them.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship of the respondent and
    complainants was one of professional fashion photographer and aspiring models.
    As the Crown has argued and the evidence supports, the complainants were all
    young (ages 18 to 21) and relatively inexperienced in modelling. The respondent
    portrayed himself and the complainants all viewed him as a significant fashion
    photographer in the industry, who had connections. The respondent, in all three
    cases, attempted to instill a sense of trust in the complainants such that they
    would be able to “perform” in front of the camera, attempted to relax them,
    again so that they would be able to pose as he wanted in front of the camera,
    began to raise sexual comments and continued to do so throughout, used sexual
    touching, purportedly for purposes of “relaxing” them prior to shoots, and told
    them that all models in the industry did that and/or that [K.R.] had done that
    and had become a good model. He touched them all in similar ways, caressing
    breasts with his fingers and touching their vaginal areas. He had all of them
    remove all of their clothing and wear robes, which he supplied, in order that
    there would be no clothing lines showing in photographs taken subsequently,
    then reached through robes to caress the models. He photographed them posed in
    the “CK” look, “implied” topless and topless.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found the similar fact evidence

    credibility of the complainants, to demonstrate a pattern of behaviour, to
    negate a defence that the complainants were fabricating, and to defy
    coincidence with respect to the offences alleged. She also found that the
    evidence was not being admitted to show bad character and that it was not

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant contends that the trial
    judge relied on “generic” factors to establish the probative value of the
    similar fact evidence. He says that “it is not surprising that the complainants
    were young and inexperienced in modelling given that they were aspiring models,
    nor is it surprising that [he] attempted to instill trust in the complainants
    and relax them so that they would pose better”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept this submission. In my view, it
    was open to the trial judge to conclude that the similarities alleged here were
    more than merely generic. Her task was not to “add up similarities and
    dissimilarities and then, like an accountant, derive a net balance”, but rather
    to determine whether there was “a persuasive degree of connection between the
    similar fact evidence and the offence charged”: <em>R. v. Shearing</em>, 2002
    SCC 58, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at paras. 48, 60; <em>J.H.</em>, at para. 20. That
    is exactly what the trial judge did.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, the alleged similar facts involved a
    consistent <em>modus operandi</em> of grooming young, vulnerable, and trusting
    women to normalize the sexual assaults for which the appellant was charged.
    While some of the similar facts alleged could perhaps be described as “generic”
    — that the models were all young and inexperienced and needed to relax before
    photoshoots — others were not, including the appellant’s alleged sexual
    touching to “relax” the complainants, his references to K.R. as a model who had
    succeeded under his guidance, and his encouraging topless implied-nude shots,
    even when not required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A trial judge’s conclusion that alleged similar
    facts are sufficiently similar rather than impermissibly generic is entitled to
    substantial deference, absent an error of law or principle or a misapprehension
    of the evidence. I see no such error.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge failed to assess the probative value of the similar fact evidence in
    relation to the specific issues in question at trial. He says that the only
    issue at trial was consent, and that the alleged similar touching with all
    three complainants was neither logically probative of that issue nor logically
    supportive of their credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree that the trial judge failed to
    assess the probative value of the similar fact evidence in relation to the
    issues at play at trial. Apart from being relevant to and probative of the <em>actus
    reus</em>, the trial judge permitted the similar fact evidence to support the
    credibility of the complainants, to demonstrate a pattern of behaviour, to
    negate a defence that the complainants were fabricating, and to defy
    coincidence with respect to the offences alleged. These were all live issues at
    trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>With respect to credibility in particular, the
    trial judge cited the admonition in <em>Handy</em>, at para. 115, that “[c]are
    must be taken not to allow too broad a gateway for the admission of propensity
    evidence”, because “[c]redibility is an issue that pervades most trials, and at
    its broadest may amount to a decision on guilt or innocence”. The trial judge
    went on to note that “[t]he probative value of similar fact evidence in a
    credibility case lies in the improbability of witnesses giving similar accounts
    of incidents unless the witnesses are telling the truth”, and as such, “the
    probative value of the evidence depends upon the similarity between the
    incidents”. She found, in this case, that the similar facts were “significantly
    similar” to justify admission across counts. Again, I see no error in the trial
    judge’s analysis or conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge erred in finding that there was no air of reality to the appellant’s
    allegation of collusion among the complainants. He notes that there was a delay
    of one to four years in reporting each of the allegations, and that before doing
    so each complainant was contacted by S.L., the appellant’s former photography
    colleague. The appellant asserts that this finding was also inconsistent with the
    trial judge’s jury charge, which left the theory of collusion with the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree that the trial judge erred in how she
    dealt with the collusion allegation. Although the trial judge found evidence of
    opportunity for collusion, she concluded that there was no evidence of actual
    collusion. This conclusion was supported by the evidence on the application. I
    see no reason to disturb it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is true that the trial judge stated in her
    reasons on the similar fact application that she found no air of reality
    regarding actual collusion. However, she then added that if she was wrong about
    this the evidence of collusion was insufficient to taint the evidence of similar
    facts, and collusion was ultimately an issue of fact for the jury to decide on
    the evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>If I am wrong as regards there being no “air
    of reality”, I nevertheless find that there is, on the evidence before the
    Court, no sufficient evidence of collusion for this Court to find that the
    similar fact evidence sought to be used among the five counts was tainted by
    collusion. Based on the foregoing, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that
    the evidence of similar facts is not tainted with collusion.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>For purposes of the trial, whether or not
    there was collusion, is ultimately a matter for the decision of the jury in
    this case, as with all findings of fact.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, the trial judge’s initial conclusion that
    there was no air of reality to the collusion theory, if read out of context, may
    seem inconsistent with her ultimately leaving this issue for the jury. I do
    not, however, read her reasons that way. She appears to have left collusion to
    the jury because she considered it in the alternative as having an air of
    reality in addressing the similar fact application. In any event, any error
    occasioned by this, if indeed there was one, inured to the appellant’s benefit,
    because collusion was ultimately left to the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I conclude that the trial

lang=EN-CA>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the jury charge made this abundantly
    clear. As the appellant concedes, the trial judge did include a standard <em>W.(D.)</em> instruction at the beginning of her charge. She was not required to repeat that
    instruction when dealing with each and every element of the offence. The trial
    judge clearly instructed the jury that it could believe some, all, or none of
    each complainant’s evidence; repeatedly explained that the Crown bore the
    burden of proof and the appellant did not have to prove anything; and cautioned
    that the verdict must be based on all the evidence. Nothing more was required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I therefore conclude that the jury charge, read
    as a whole, properly equipped the jury to decide the case. Thus, I conclude
    that the jury charge easily passes muster under a functional assessment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For these reasons, I would dismiss the

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial judge err in sentencing?</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the jury found the appellant guilty of
    sexually assaulting C.K. and A.R., the trial judge sentenced the appellant to 51-months’
    imprisonment, less credit for 13 days of pre-trial custody and three months for
    strict bail conditions during the first year.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This sentence consisted of three years and three
    months for assaulting C.K., and one year for assaulting A.R., to be served
    consecutively. The trial judge noted that the crimes against each of C.K. and
    A.R. were separate and distinct, and that as a general principle, assaults that
    are separate, unrelated transactions should receive separate, consecutive
    sentences. The sentence imposed was roughly midway between the parties’
    submissions: the Crown had sought six years and three months, while the defence
    argued for two years plus a day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claims that the trial judge erred
    in two respects.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the appellant asserts that the trial
    judge erred in sentencing with respect to the offences committed against A.R. by
    considering an aggravating factor — digital penetration — that had not been
    proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, the appellant says that there
    was a discrepancy in the evidence on the extent of sexual touching of A.R.: she
    testified that the touching included digital penetration; he testified that it
    did not. The appellant argues that the jury’s verdict showed that it was
    satisfied that there was sexual touching without consent, but does not show
    what touching was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant submits that before
    the trial judge could rely on digital penetration as an aggravating sentencing
    factor, she should have made an independent determination of the facts: <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, ss. 724(3)(d) and (e); <em>R. v. Ferguson</em>, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1
    S.C.R. 96, at paras. 17-18.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I disagree with the appellant’s claim that the
    trial judge considered digital penetration as an aggravating factor. The issue
    of whether the non-consensual touching of A.R. specifically included digital
    penetration was not explored in the parties’ sentencing submissions, which
    suggests that neither party considered it especially material to sentence. The
    trial judge’s reasons mentioned the alleged digital penetration in passing, but
    did not treat it as an aggravating factor. The specific aggravating factors she
    considered were the power imbalance that the appellant exploited to take
    “advantage of two young, inexperienced aspiring models who perceived him as
    experienced, trusted him as a professional and were deceived”; and “the ages of
    the victims, the fact that there were two victims and several incidents of
    sexual assault and further that the victims were significantly affected.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, the appellant claims that the trial
    judge violated the totality principle in imposing consecutive sentences,
    resulting in an “unduly long or harsh” combined sentence contrary to s.
    718.2(c) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>. The appellant submits that a total
    sentence of 51 months for a first-time offender was demonstrably unfit because he
    has excellent prospects for rehabilitation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As is well known, trial judges have broad
    discretion in sentencing and are accorded significant deference on appeal. An
    appeal court can intervene only where the sentencing decision reveals an error
    of law or principle that has an impact on the sentence, or where the sentence
    imposed is demonstrably unfit: <em>R.&nbsp;v. Lacasse</em>, 2015 SCC 64, [2015]
    3 S.C.R. 1089, at paras. 11, 44.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the 51-month total sentence imposed for
    these offences was not demonstrably unfit. The appellant was found to have
    violated the trust of two complainants through serious sexual misconduct,
    including forced penile penetration in one case, with profound psychological
    consequences for both complainants. While the appellant had no prior record,
    there were few other mitigating factors. The sentence for this misconduct against
    two complainants fell within the range of sentences for similarly-situated
    offenders, which, while involving somewhat different circumstances of abuse of
    trust, confirm the fitness of the combined sentence imposed here: see, for
    example, <em>R. v. Bradley</em>, 2008 ONCA 179, 234 O.A.C. 363, at para. 18
    (three-year sentence for a single count of sexual assault by a police officer with
    no prior criminal record who vaginally and anally penetrated a mentee who
    aspired to become a police officer); <em>R. v. Wood</em>, 2015 ONCA 337, at
    para. 4 (six-year sentence for a pastor convicted of sexual offences against
    three parishioners); and <em>R. v. Clase</em>, 2017 ONSC 2484 (five-year
    sentence for sexual assault involving vaginal penetration and choking). I
    therefore see no basis to disturb the sentence imposed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, although I would grant leave to
    appeal sentence, I would dismiss the sentence appeal.</span></p>
