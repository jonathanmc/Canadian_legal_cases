  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the conclusion of the oral hearing we allowed
    this appeal for reasons to follow. These are our reasons. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following a judge alone trial, the appellant was
    convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment plus two
    years’ probation. He appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against
    sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant raises five issues on his
    conviction appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We conclude that the following three issues are
    dispositive of the conviction appeal and require that the appeal be allowed,
    the conviction set aside, and a new trial ordered. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, we accept the appellant’s submission that
    the trial judge made an <em>R. v. W.(D.) </em>error by treating the credibility
    issue as a contest between the complainant and the appellant and failing to
    consider whether the evidence as a whole left her with a reasonable doubt: [1991]
    1 S.C.R. 742. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On several occasions throughout her reasons, the
    trial judge framed her conclusions in language indicating she was deciding
    which version of events she preferred and that reasonable doubt did not play a
    role in her findings. Some examples are the following, found at paras. 96, 124,
    127 and 130 of the reasons below:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Except where
    otherwise stated, I prefer the complainant’s testimony to that of the accused.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As indicated
    herein, I find the complainant’s version of facts to be more credible.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='
text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I am left with a significant
    doubt as regards [the appellant’s] evidence of the occurrences of that evening. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='
text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find this evidence to
    be somewhat suspect and contrived. As indicated, in terms of credibility I
    prefer [the complainant’s] version of the facts, which I find is more credible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We acknowledge that the trial judge instructed
    herself on the principles of reasonable doubt in accordance with <em>W.(D.)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em> Nonetheless, reading her reasons as a
    whole we cannot be satisfied she properly applied those principles. In addition
    to treating the credibility issue as if it were a contest between competing
    versions of events, having found the complainant to be the more credible
    witness, the trial judge failed to step back and consider whether the whole of
    the evidence, including the appellant’s evidence, was nonetheless capable of
    giving rise to a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, we agree that the trial judge failed to
    meaningfully recognize or address the evidence of the complainant’s possible
    motive to fabricate when assessing credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was undisputed at trial that, following an
    afternoon and evening of drinking and partying with friends, the appellant had
    sexual intercourse with the complainant on the couch in his living room while
    the complainant’s husband was sleeping in an adjacent room. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>Just as these events were ending, the complainant’s husband emerged
    from the adjacent room. </span>He immediately asked what was going on and flew
    into a violent rage. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the couple walked home, the complainant’s husband persistently questioned her
    as to what had happened. He threatened to leave the complainant and stated
    repeatedly, “Tell me this guy abused you” or “Did he abuse you?”. The fact that
    the complainant did not immediately, when confronted, tell her husband that she
    had been assaulted and did so only after they had returned home, in response to
    his repeated entreaties, was relevant to whether she had a motive to fabricate,
    and ultimately to her credibility.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rather than giving this evidence proper consideration, the trial
    judge dismissed the defence focus on this evidence as “part of an ongoing myth
    regarding sexual consent”: at para. 133. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This was an error. <span lang=EN-CA>Undoubtedly it was open to
    the trial judge to accept the complainant’s evidence that she did not consent
    to sexual activity and that her response to her husband’s questioning was due
    to a myriad of factors that had nothing to do with fabrication. However, in the
    circumstances of this case, the trial judge was also obliged to consider
    whether the events gave rise to a motive to fabricate and, if so, how that
    reflected on her assessment of the complainant’s credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A motive to fabricate can be an important factor that is germane
    to a witness’s credibility: <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Batte </span></em>(2000),
    49 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at para. 120. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, i</span>t was incumbent on the trial judge
    to consider the evidence that was both consistent and inconsistent with
    consent, which was the central issue at trial. The complainant’s actions,
    including the fact that she did not “assuage” her husband’s concerns and doubts
    by responding to his questions when asked what was going on, were relevant.
    This evidence ought to have been addressed and not dismissed as irrelevant by
    the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Third, we accept the appellant’s submission that
    the trial judge relied improperly on the appellant’s presence in the courtroom
    when the complainant testified to negatively assess his credibility. Twice in
    her reasons the trial judge referred to the appellant’s presence in the
    courtroom while the complainant testified and used this factor against him in

    judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Further, his
    testimony, <span class=Underline>coming after hearing the complainant’s
    testimony</span>, essentially mirrored her description of what occurred leading
    up to and during the sexual encounter, but he portrayed her as the aggressor.
    This simply does not have the ring of truth. I found his evidence to be
    contrived.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[The appellant’s]
    testimony, <span class=Underline>following thereafter,</span> recounted the
    same occurrences, but made her the “aggressor”. He testified that she attempted
    to kiss him, he rebuffed her as he did not want to “get her hopes up”. She
    attempted a second time to kiss him, and then put her hand on his penis outside
    and then inside his pants. Throughout, he attempted to rebuff her and she
    continued as the “aggressor”.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, his evidence essentially mirrored hers, but
    throughout his testimony, he portrayed, the actions as coming from her, not
    him, and made her the aggressor. I find this evidence to be somewhat suspect
    and contrived. As indicated, in terms of credibility, I prefer her version of
    the facts, which I find is more credible. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As this court recognized in <em>R. v. Jorgge</em>,
    2013 ONCA 485, 4 C.R. (7th) 170, accused persons have not only a statutory
    obligation but also a right to be present at their trial, grounded in their
    constitutionally guaranteed rights to a fair trial and to make full answer and
    defence: at para. 12. On our review of her reasons, the trial judge used this
    right against the appellant to find that he had the opportunity to tailor his
    evidence and that he did so. This line of reasoning is not permissible: <em>Jorgge</em>,
    at para. 18. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent acknowledges that absent an
    allegation of recent fabrication it is impermissible to reason that an accused
    person tailored their evidence to correspond with the prosecution’s evidence.
    However, the respondent argues that did not happen here. Rather the trial judge
    was merely commenting on the sequence of the evidence. Moreover, the trial
    judge gave many valid reasons for disbelieving the evidence. Even if the trial
    judge fell into error, it was a minor error that did not occupy a prominent
    position in her reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We cannot accept the respondent’s submissions.
    On a plain reading of the paragraphs we have quoted, read in context, the trial
    judge used the appellant’s presence in the courtroom as a basis for rejecting
    his evidence. We are unable to say that this error did not taint the trial
    judge’s reasoning process. Moreover, when considered with the other errors we
    have identified, we are satisfied that the cumulative effect of the trial judge’s
    errors requires a new trial. </span></p>

    unnecessary to consider the remaining grounds of appeal. The appeal is allowed,
    the conviction is set aside and a new trial is ordered. </span></p>
