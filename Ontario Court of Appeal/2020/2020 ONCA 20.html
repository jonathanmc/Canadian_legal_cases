  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on April 29, 2016 by
    Justice <span lang=EN-US>Ronald M. Laliberté</span> of the Superior Court of
    Justice, sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR
    DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of two counts of sexual interference against
    his step-daughter, M.T., who accused him of rubbing and penetrating her vagina
    with his fingers on several occasions when she was between 7 and 14 years of
    age. The appellant was acquitted of sexual abuse charges against his biological
    daughter, A.T.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant raises the following arguments on appeal:</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge engaged in impermissible speculative reasoning in rejecting
    the evidence of K.R. when he relied on hearsay evidence of the statements and
    behaviour of the complainants’ mother, J.T. </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge placed undue weight on the demeanor of M.T. in assessing
    her credibility, while ignoring relevant inconsistencies in her testimony.</p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The verdict is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal with reasons to
    follow. These are our reasons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The trial judge was entitled to reject the appellant’s
    evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.T., and A.T. testified at trial, along with the appellant. The trial
    judge found that M.T. was credible, but rejected the evidence of A.T. and the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was open to the trial judge to find that the appellant was not a
    reliable witness and that his evidence was not credible. As to reliability, the
    appellant acknowledged that his memory was harmed by two drug overdoses; that
    he sometimes has difficulty remembering things; and that he told the police
    that some of his memory had been “erased”. These memory problems undermined the
    appellant’s evidence that he was never alone with the children at any time,
    despite his insistence to the contrary. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that he did not bathe the children after they
    were no longer infants; that he was never left alone with the children when
    J.T. went shopping; that he never put the children to bed; and that he never
    played with them in their bedroom. He acknowledged skiing and skating alone
    with the children, but said that there were other people around when he went
    swimming with them. The appellant acknowledged only that he was “not basically
    alone” with the children while watching television in the living room, as J.T. would
    be in the kitchen cooking and would walk in and out of the living room.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s finding that it was highly improbable that the
    appellant would never have been alone with his daughters is supported by the evidence
    and is reasonable. The trial judge considered that the appellant’s evidence on
    this point was an attempt to exclude any opportunity for him to commit the
    offences. The same is true of the appellant’s evidence that he went onto the
    roof because it was leaking, and not to spy on M.T. while she was in the
    bathroom. It was open to the trial judge to conclude that the appellant was
    neither reliable nor credible and that his evidence did not raise a reasonable
    doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s credibility findings do not depend on hearsay evidence
    or speculation concerning J.T.’s reaction when M.T. told her that the appellant
    had abused her. Nor does M.T.’s evidence that her mother was at home at the
    time of some of the abuse undermine the trial judge’s finding that the
    appellant was not credible. M.T.’s evidence was that the mother was <em>elsewhere
    in the home</em> at the time, occupied with watching television, having a
    cigarette or a coffee, or cooking. The trial judge’s credibility and
    reliability findings are entitled to deference and there is no basis for this
    court to interfere with them.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The trial judge was entitled to accept MT’s evidence</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by emphasizing the
    demeanour of M.T. in determining her credibility and reliability, despite the
    lack of details and inconsistencies in her testimony. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that M.T.’s evidence was both detailed and
    internally consistent, and highlighted several reasons for finding that she was
    reliable and credible. He found that M.T.’s evidence was confirmed in a number
    of ways by external evidence, including the appellant’s evidence. He
    acknowledged that M.T. was wrong in believing that the appellant had cut her
    door in half so as to deny her privacy, as the door was already cut when they
    moved into the home. But it was open to the trial judge to find that this was
    not a significant point in the context of her evidence as a whole. Although the
    trial judge remarked that M.T.’s demeanour was “appropriate”, her demeanour did
    not play a significant role in the trial judge’s findings. He specifically
    cautioned himself that demeanor is not, in and of itself, an appropriate means
    of measure for reliability and/or credibility. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In summary, there is no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s
    findings on reliability and credibility of M.T.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The verdict is not unreasonable</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is well established that there is a high bar to meet to establish
    that a verdict is unreasonable. The appellant simply repeats what he regards as
    frailties in the evidence of the complainant and asserts a failure of the trial
    judge to understand or apply the evidence. This does not come close to
    establishing that the verdict was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge was alive to the burden of proof, as reflected in his
    decision to acquit the appellant on charges related to his daughter A.T. He
    properly applied the law as set out in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 SCR 742.
    Having rejected the evidence of the appellant and found that it did not raise a
    reasonable doubt, he was satisfied that the evidence established guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt. There is no basis to interfere with his decision.</p>
  <p class=Heading>Conclusion</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
