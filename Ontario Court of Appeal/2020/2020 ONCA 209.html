  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual
    assault contrary to s. 273(1) of the </span><em>Criminal Code</em><span
lang=EN-US>. He was sentenced to ten years’ incarceration, less credit for
    presentence custody. He appeals from conviction and sentence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The complainant testified that she was in the
    company of a few people, including the appellant, on the evening of the alleged
    offence. A lot of alcohol had been consumed. They eventually ended up at the
    appellant’s residence, where even more alcohol was consumed. The complainant fell
    asleep fully clothed but awoke to find the appellant removing her clothes. She
    was turned onto her stomach and vaginally penetrated from behind, while being
    strangled with what she believed to be a cloth. She thought she was going to
    die, saw stars and then everything went “black”. She reported the incident to
    the police the following day. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first police officer who saw the complainant
    when she arrived at the police station testified that she immediately noticed
    that the complainant’s “eyes were bleeding or they looked like they were
    bleeding.” The officer also said that the complainant had such “severe petechial
    hemorrhaging” that the officer had only previously seen that condition in
    sudden death cases. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In appealing his conviction, the appellant
    argues that his trial counsel was ineffective and that this resulted in a
    miscarriage of justice. He raises numerous examples of that ineffectiveness, which
    can be grouped under the following categories. He contends that his counsel
    failed to:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>call certain witnesses to rebut the Crown evidence, including the
    evidence of a cab driver and others who could have testified about prior sexual
    encounters between the appellant and complainant; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>elicit an expert opinion to rebut the Crown expert; and </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>explore whether photos of the complainant’s injuries had been
    tampered with. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant also suggests that his counsel,
    Crown counsel and the trial judge may have discussed matters outside of his presence.
    Finally, he suggests that trial counsel may well have had a conflict of
    interest in representing him because she may have been involved in a previous unrelated
    case involving a family member of his.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We see no basis upon which to set aside the
    conviction. The record does not support the appellant’s suggestions of
    incompetence. This was a strong Crown case that rested on credibility findings that
    were open to the trial judge to make. The complainant’s credibility was
    entirely supported by the forensic evidence, including the facial and neck
    injuries resulting from strangulation. Moreover, much of the evidence that the
    appellant suggests should have been elicited by his counsel, either through
    cross-examination or through the calling of other witnesses, was inadmissible
    pursuant to the collateral facts rule, or constituted presumptively
    inadmissible evidence of hearsay or prior sexual history evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The expert evidence was non-controversial. The
    witness testified about how strangulation can cause death and secondary
    injuries, such as subconjunctival hemorrhages, ligature bruising and facial
    petechiae, all of which are seen in the photos of the complainant’s injuries. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We see no basis upon which to suggest that the
    photos of the complainant, on which the expert based his opinion, have been
    tampered with. Indeed, what is seen in the photos is supported by the testimony
    of the police officer who saw the complainant upon her arrival at the police
    station. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is no evidence to support the suggestion that
    defence counsel met with the Crown and trial judge outside of the appellant’s
    presence. As for the suggestion of conflict, it is the appellant’s onus to
    establish one. The record does not support his position on conflict. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Duty counsel assisted the appellant with his
    sentence appeal, arguing that the trial judge erred in treating the appellant’s
    lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. There is no dispute that an absence
    of remorse does not constitute an aggravating factor. Crown counsel argues
    that, reading the reasons as a whole, the trial judge should be interpreted as
    suggesting that the appellant’s lack of remorse and lack of insight into the
    offence demonstrated his poor rehabilitative prospects.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While it is not entirely clear to us how the
    trial judge was using the reference to the “absence of remorse”, the
    appellant’s submission is not without some force, particularly given that the
    reference to the lack of remorse falls squarely within the list of aggravating
    factors. In our view, though, even if the trial judge incorrectly used the lack
    of remorse in this way, it had no impact on the sentence: </span><em>R. v.
    Lacasse</em><i><span lang=EN-US>, </span></i>2015 SCC 64, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089,
    at paras. 11 and 44.<span lang=EN-US> There were six other serious aggravating
    factors, the most serious being that the victim was strangled so badly that she
    was at risk of dying. Considering the seriousness of the offence, the global
    sentence of ten years was appropriate. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Duty counsel also submitted that the judge erred
    in identifying the primary sentencing objectives as deterrence and
    denunciation. She argues that these objectives are not entirely consistent with
    the judge’s acknowledgment of the serious </span><em>Gladue</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>factors relevant to the appellant’s case. The appellant himself also
    submitted that the sentencing judge had not read the </span><em>Gladue</em><i> </i><span
lang=EN-US>report. There is nothing to support the appellant’s submission that
    the judge had not read the report. Given the seriousness of the offence,
    deterrence and denunciation were appropriate sentencing objectives, and the trial
    judge’s acknowledgment of this did not render the sentence unfit. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The conviction appeal is dismissed. Leave to
