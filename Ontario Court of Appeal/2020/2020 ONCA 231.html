  <p class=Judge><span lang=EN-CA>Hourigan J.A.:</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.M. was found guilty of gang sexual assault,
    sexual assault with a weapon, uttering threats, and robbery. He was 17 years
    old at the time of the offences but was not charged until approximately 24
    years later. R.M. appeals both his convictions and sentence. The Crown cross-appeals
    the conditional stay of the gang sexual assault conviction. As will be
    discussed, I would dismiss the conviction and sentence appeals, but allow the
    Crown’s cross-appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>R.M. advances two grounds of appeal against his
    conviction. First, he submits that the verdict is unreasonable because other
    reasonable inferences could have been drawn from the circumstantial evidence. I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal, as the alternative inferences
    proposed by R.M. are entirely speculative.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second argument made on the conviction
    appeal is that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the complainant's
    credibility. I do not accept that submission. The trial judge properly
    considered inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence and determined that
    those inconsistencies were immaterial to his finding that the complainant was
    credible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge sentenced R.M. to six years’
    incarceration for the sexual assault with a weapon conviction, and one year
    each for the convictions for robbery and uttering threats, all to be served
    consecutively for a total of eight years. On the sentence appeal, R.M. submits
    that a youth sentence is appropriate, or alternatively, an adult sentence of
    three years’ incarceration should be imposed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In support of his position that a youth sentence
    is appropriate, R.M. submits that the Crown failed to rebut the presumption of
    diminished moral culpability for a young offender (the “Presumption”). Given
    that the trial took place approximately 27 years after the offences, there was
    not extensive evidence regarding R.M.’s maturity, moral sophistication, and
    capacity for independent judgment at the time of the offences. However, there
    was sufficient evidence on the record to permit the trial judge to conclude
    that the Crown had met its onus of rebutting the Presumption. Accordingly, I
    would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second ground of appeal on sentence is that
    the trial judge violated the Coke principle, which will be explained below at
    para. 31, by relying on R.M.’s subsequent criminal record as an aggravating
    factor in sentencing him for what were his first offences. Assuming, without
    deciding, that the Coke principle applies in this case, I am not satisfied that
    the trial judge used the subsequent record as an aggravating factor on
    sentence. Instead, he made a brief reference to the record for the permissible
    purpose of evaluating R.M.’s rehabilitative prospects. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Regarding the fitness of the sentence, this was
    a vicious sexual assault of a vulnerable victim. The trial judge did not err in
    fixing the sentence, and the sentence was not demonstrably unfit. There is,
    therefore, no basis for appellate interference.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Concerning the Crown cross-appeal, the trial
    judge erred in conditionally staying the gang sexual assault conviction because
    there is an insufficient legal nexus between that conviction and the conviction
    for sexual assault with a weapon. Therefore, the conditional stay order must be
    set aside.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the summer of 1990, the complainant was 21
    years old and was a sex worker in Toronto. On the night of August 16, a client
    drove her back from his apartment to the intersection of Church and Carlton
    Streets. The complainant got out of the car and was looking through her purse
    for a cigarette when someone grabbed her and dragged her into a parking lot.
    Two men violently and repeatedly raped her at knifepoint. They debated whether
    they should “let her get away”. They threatened her not to tell anyone,
    ridiculed her, robbed her of $500, and then fled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Fearful that the assailants might still be in
    the area, the complainant gathered her belongings and flagged down a taxi,
    which took her to the hospital. The subsequent police investigation was
    unfruitful.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2002, a police review of cold cases
    discovered deposits of two male DNA profiles in the complainant's underwear. In
    2016, a blood sample was matched to one of these DNA profiles. There was no
    dispute that the major DNA profile in the complainant's underwear belonged to
    R.M.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the complainant was able to recount
    the details of the sexual assault but was inconsistent in describing some of
    the events that occurred before, and during, the assault. R.M. did not testify
    or call any evidence.</span></p>

    particular the nature of the sex acts she engaged in with her clients before

    judge did not err in finding that the inconsistencies regarding whom the

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>First, sentencing judges are in the best position
    to determine a just and appropriate sentence that pays heed to the sentencing
    objectives and principles set out in the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal
    Code</span></em><span lang=EN>. It is especially so where the sentence is
    imposed after a contested trial. Accordingly, appellate courts accord
    substantial deference to sentencing decisions when exercising their powers of
    review under s. 687(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN>: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v. Lacasse</span></em><span lang=EN>,

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Second, an appellate court is entitled to
    intervene under s. 687(1) of the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span
lang=EN> where the sentencing judge erred in principle, failed to consider a
    relevant factor, or erred in considering an aggravating or mitigating factor,
    but only if it appears from the sentencing judge’s decision, read as a whole,
    the error … had an impact on the sentence ultimately imposed: </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Lacasse</span></em><span lang=EN>, at paras. 43-44. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>Third, the mere fact that a judge deviates from
    the proper sentencing range does not, on its own, justify appellate
    intervention. The choice of sentencing range or of a category within a range
    falls within the trial judge’s discretion and cannot, on its own, constitute a
    reviewable error. Apart from errors of law or principle that impact the
    sentence, appellate intervention is only warranted where the sentence imposed
    is demonstrably unfit, that is to say, clearly unreasonable: <i>Lacasse</i>, at
    paras. 11, 51-52. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>The final point concerns aggravating and
    mitigating factors. While it is an error to consider an element of the offence
    an aggravating factor, such an error must have had an impact on the sentence
    imposed to permit appellate intervention: </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Lacasse</span></em><span
lang=EN>, at paras. 42-44. Likewise, a sentencing judge’s decision to weigh
    aggravating and mitigating factors in a particular way does not, in itself,
    permit appellate intervention unless the weighing is unreasonable: </span><em><span

    of that evidence, R.M. argues that the trial judge erred by merely relying on
    the nature of the offences as evidence of R.M.’s character at the time. He
    submits that if sentencing judges need look no further than the constituent
    elements of the offence charged for evidence that the Presumption has been
    rebutted, then in any case where there is planning and deliberation, the
    Crown’s onus will be satisfied, defeating the purpose of the Presumption. </span></p>

    letting their victim “get away” all support a level of maturity, independent
    judgment, and foresight similar to that of an adult. Moreover, [R.M.] was

    night close to a secluded spot suitable for the assault. They cooperated
    throughout their attack, so that one could keep a knife to her throat while the
    other assaulted her. They thought to check the insole of her shoe for concealed
    cash. They joked about the money she had made that evening, and one attacker
    laughed at the other’s inability to penetrate. They weighed the costs and
    benefits of letting her “get away”, as she might go to the police, and after
    considering what would be “more trouble”, one of them said that they should
    leave her, as this was “just raping”. Such deliberations suggest an appreciation

    moral judgment or sophistication demonstrated in the planning and

    door and threatened the complainant that he would kill her with the knife he
    claimed to have in his back pocket. He forced her into the back room and forced
    her to perform oral sex, then penetrated her vaginally without using a condom.
    The offence was premeditated and brutal on a totally vulnerable victim who
    suffered significant long-term consequences in her personal life, including
    estrangement from her family and ongoing fear. The appellant had a criminal
    record that included a domestic assault.</span></p>

    years' incarceration for a 17-year-old first-time offender may appear to be
    harsh. However, the trial judge appears to have been influenced by the very
    serious nature of the offences. The complainant was repeatedly raped, by two
    men, without condoms, while a knife was held to her throat. They threatened her
    with death, robbed her, and ridiculed her. After raping her, they debated
    whether they should “let her get away” as she would “go to the cops” if they
    did. This was a particularly vicious attack where a vulnerable victim was
    terrorized and humiliated. </span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A comparison of the constituent elements of
    the offences in issue is an essential part of the legal nexus inquiry. 
    However, the mere fact that offences share common elements does not establish a
    sufficient legal nexus between those offences to warrant the application of the <em>Kienapple</em> rule.  The legal nexus inquiry is directed not at finding
    common elements between offences, but at determining whether there are
    different elements in the offences which sufficiently distinguish them so as to
    foreclose the application of the <em>Kienapple</em> rule.  As indicated in
    Prince at p. 49:</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>[T]he

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The crucial question is whether the offences
    represent different criminal wrongs or the same wrong committed in different
    ways. A sufficient legal nexus is not established where the offences target
    different societal interests, different victims, or prohibit different
    consequences: Kinnear, at para, 39. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the present cross-appeal, the Crown argues
    that there is an insufficient legal nexus because the offences have different
    elements and protect different interests. R.M. submits that gang sexual assault
    and sexual assault with a weapon are two ways of committing the same offence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court’s decision in <em>R. v. Osbourne</em> (1994), 75 O.A.C. 315 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1995] S.C.C.A. No. 91,
    is instructive. There, the appellant pulled out a gun and fired at police
    officers, but missed them. He was convicted of aggravated assault and of using
    a firearm in the commission of the aggravated assault. Finlayson J.A. upheld
    both convictions and rejected a <em>Kienapple</em> argument. The aggravated
    assault conviction was based on the fact that the appellant’s conduct
    endangered the life of the police officer. The court found that aggravated assault
    could be committed in a variety of ways, with or without weapons, and that if
    the offender chose to commit aggravated assault using a firearm, this attracted
    additional liability. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, sexual assault with a weapon and
    gang sexual assault are not two ways of committing the same offence. Though
    both involve heightened coercion, the two offences protect different interests.
    The use of a weapon significantly increases the risk of physical harm.
    Committing sexual assault in a group compounds the violation of the victim’s
    sexual integrity and may significantly increase the risk of sexually
    transmitted disease and pregnancy. Following Osbourne, R.M.’s decision to
    commit sexual assault with a weapon, and his decision to commit the offence
    with another party, should each attract criminal liability. Therefore, I would
