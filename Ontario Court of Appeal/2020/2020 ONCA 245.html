lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Police officers believed that drug trafficking
    was taking place within a residence. They watched as the appellant drove up to that
    residence, parked his car, went inside, emerged a short time later, and drove
    off. The police then stopped the appellant and arrested him for being in possession
    of controlled substances. A search incident to arrest revealed a good deal of
    cash, a loaded firearm, heroin and cocaine. </span></p>

    ss. 8 and 9 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights had been breached, she dismissed the
    appellant’s application to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em><i>. </i>Convictions were entered on various drug trafficking and firearm offences.
    A four-and-a-half-year sentence was imposed. </span></p>

    that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude the evidence under s. 24(2).
    In the alternative, the appellant claims that the verdict was unreasonable.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>CONTEXT</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A confidential informant told the police that an
    individual by the name of Jason Nacinovich was trafficking heroin and fentanyl
    out of a specific residential address in Barrie, Ontario. Several civilians had
    previously made complaints about people coming and going from that home. The
    police set up surveillance on the address and made observations consistent with
    what they believed to be drug trafficking in the home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the confidential tip and the
    surveillance on the home, the police applied for a search warrant for the home.
    The warrant was declined by a Justice of the Peace on the following basis: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Grounds as presented and when considered in
    totality, falls short of rpg to believe that items to be searched for will be
    at the location. No evidence to show that heroin and fentanyl would be in
    residence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When the police learned that the search warrant
    had been denied, they decided to arrest “the next suspected buyers.” The team
    leader, Det. Fitzgerald, explained at trial his understanding as to why the
    warrant had been denied: that there were insufficient grounds to believe that heroin
    and fentanyl, as opposed to other controlled substances, were in the residence.
    Accordingly, he instructed his team to “arrest the next suspected buyers …
    [p]ersons that come and show behaviour similar to what we’ve observed over the
    last couple of days.” Det. Fitzgerald was hopeful that by proceeding in this
    way, the police would obtain grounds to advance a second search warrant
    application for the home:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>… I believe we have reasonable grounds to make
    the arrest and then search incident to arrest. Yes, I would hope to locate the
    drugs that in my mind, they’re purchasing from the residence, and they’re under
    arrest for possession of a controlled substance, and then we have the evidence
    to support that which then I can add to my warrant hopefully meet the threshold
    to get the warrant for [the address]. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s vehicle was the next one to
    arrive after the police learned that the search warrant was refused. He and his
    passenger went inside the home, stayed for about 15 minutes and then left. An
    officer making the observations believed that there were grounds to arrest the
    appellant and his passenger for being in possession of a controlled substance. Accordingly,
    two uniform officers were instructed to pull over the vehicle and make the
    arrests. </span></p>

    packaged in small baggies and secreted in an air vent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also had a leather wallet slip in
    his pocket, one that matched his wallet. That slip contained ownership and
    insurance documents for the vehicle in someone else’s name. The car also
    contained auto financing documents in relation to the vehicle, dated only weeks
    before the offence. They were addressed to the appellant and suggested that he
    owed a sum of money for the vehicle, as well as costs that had been incurred as
    a result of non-payment. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>THE DECISION APPEALED FROM </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant claimed that: (a) his s. 9 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights had been infringed on the basis that the police lacked sufficient
    reasonable grounds to arrest him; (b) his s. 8 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights
    had been infringed as a result of conducting a search incident to an unlawful
    arrest; and (c) the evidence arising from the search incident to the unlawful
    arrest should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em><i>. </i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found that the appellant’s ss. 8
    and 9 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights had been infringed. While she accepted
    that the police held a subjective belief that the appellant had purchased drugs
    in the residence, she concluded that this belief was not objectively reasonable
    in the circumstances. Accordingly, the trial judge found that the arrest
    breached the appellant’s s. 9 <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights. The s. 8 breach
    necessarily flowed from the fact that the search incident to arrest was
    unreasonable given the unlawful nature of the arrest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then went on to address the
    three <em>Grant</em><i> </i>factors for consideration in determining whether to
    exclude the evidence obtained in a manner that infringed the appellant’s <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights: (a) the seriousness of the <em>Charter</em><i>-</i>infringing state
    conduct; (b) the impact of the breach on the <em>Charter</em><i>-</i>protected
    interests of the accused; and (c) society’s interest in an adjudication of the
    case on the merits: <em>R. v. Grant</em>, 2009 SCC 32, [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353, at
    para. 71. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Under the first branch, the trial judge found
    that while the police conduct was negligent, it was not flagrant or abusive. She
    held the view that, while the police did not have adequate grounds to arrest
    the appellant, they had sufficient grounds to have justified an investigative
    detention. Even so, the trial judge found that the police failed to consider
    that option. She also recognized that, on its own, an investigative detention
    would not have afforded the police the ability to search the vehicle where the
    drugs and gun were located. Ultimately, she concluded that the police behaviour,
    “while serious, [was] not such that requires the Court to distance itself from
    that behaviour, in these particular circumstances.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the second branch, the trial judge accepted
    that the impact of the breach on the accused’s <em>Charter</em><i>-</i>protected
    interests was significant and favoured exclusion. This is not in dispute on
    appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the third branch, the trial judge found that
    the charges were serious, that the evidence was reliable, and that it was
    critical to the Crown’s case. Overall she found that these factors favoured inclusion.
    At the same time, she observed the “equally” important fact that when
    investigating serious crime, the police should respect <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After balancing all three factors, the trial
    judge dismissed the application for exclusion. She concluded as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In summary: (a) the police conduct was
    serious, but not egregious; (b) the impact on the accused’s <i>Charter </i>rights
    was significant, and (c) the value of the evidence is also significant. In
    weighing all of these factors, the defence have not satisfied me that the
    admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into
    disrepute. Therefore, the evidence of the drugs and the gun are admissible. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then moved on to consider
    whether she was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown had proven
    the various possession offences. The parties agreed that the core issue for her
    determination was whether the appellant had knowledge of the contents of the
    vehicle, specifically the loaded firearm and drugs. Satisfied that the Crown
    had proven knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge convicted the
    appellant. The passenger was acquitted. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant maintains that the trial judge
    made three specific legal errors in her s. 24(2) analysis, all of which relate

    state conduct. He argues that she erred in: </span></p>

    “mistakenly believed” that they had the grounds to arrest the appellant, she
    was satisfied that their grounds rose to the level of a reasonable suspicion
    that the appellant was in possession of a controlled substance, sufficient to
    justify an investigative detention. The appellant argues that the trial judge
    erred in arriving at that conclusion. Relying upon <em>R. v. Simpson</em><i>, </i>(1993)
    79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 (Ont. C.A.), the appellant maintains that an individual
    cannot be stopped and investigated simply on the basis that he or she has
    attended at a home where drug trafficking is suspected to occur. The appellant
    says that is exactly what happened in this case. Accordingly, the appellant
    argues that the police had no grounds to even stop the appellant’s vehicle, let
    alone arrest him. He contends that, had the trial judge appreciated this fact,
    it would have worked to aggravate the seriousness of the breach. </span></p>

    finding that there were sufficient grounds for an investigative detention
    appears to have been conceded by the appellant at trial. Early in her reasons,
    the trial judge specifically adverted to that concession. As she noted, while
    the grounds were not sufficient to support an arrest, “it is conceded that this
    was sufficient to conduct an investigatory detention of the accused.” </span></p>

    conceded is an understandable one when counsel’s closing submissions are
    considered. By way of example, counsel made the observation, “you don’t arrest
    suspected buyers, you detain them and the police would have been entitled to do
    that and ask a few questions, make observations”. When counsel was asked if the
    matter was being “concede[d], on the evidence before [the trial judge], that
    the police officers had sufficient grounds to conduct an investigative
    detention of [the appellant]”, counsel answered “<u>[c]ertainly I think they

    trial counsel’s argument qualify the concession, I do not need to resolve this
    point. As I will explain, whether the fairly clear concession was later
    qualified, is neither here nor here because there were ample grounds upon which
    to detain the appellant for investigation. </span></p>

    the <em>Simpson</em><i> </i>case operates against a completely different set of

    “crack house”, the police information about the house was of unknown age and
    unknown reliability. Indeed, the officer who detained Ms. Simpson testified
    that he had simply read an internal police memorandum authored by another
    officer describing that residence as a suspected “crack house”. That
    information was obtained from an unidentified “street contact”. The detaining
    officer knew nothing about the house and the tip from the “street contact” had

    where the “sole factor” informing the grounds is attendance at a drug house
    where “the information concerning the location is itself of unknown age and
    reliability”, this does not mean that attendance at a drug house in other
    circumstances cannot furnish the grounds for an investigative detention.
    Indeed, there are times where, based upon the totality of circumstances, a
    person’s attendance at a drug house may even form sufficient grounds for arrest: <em>R. v. Rover</em><i>, </i>2018 ONCA 745, 145 O.R. (3d) 135, at paras. 11-13. </span></p>

    circumstances known to the police at the time that the investigative step is
    taken. The factual matrix of this case is fundamentally different than the one
    that drove the result in <em>Simpson</em><i>. </i>This case involved
    experienced police officers, some of whom had deep experience in investigating
    drug-related crime. They were permitted to bring their practical, everyday
    experience to the interpretation of what they were seeing: <em>Chehil</em><i>,</i> at para. 29. </span></p>

    case where the age or reliability of the information about what was believed to
    be going on in the home was wanting. There was a confidential tip about drug
    trafficking at the exact residence where civilians had made complaints about
    activity that suggested short visits to buy drugs. Police surveillance
    confirmed that activity, revealing numerous people, some of whom were known to
    the police from the local drug community, attending at the residence for very
    short periods of time. The police even observed what they believed to be a hand-to-hand
    drug transaction through the window of a vehicle out front of the residence, just
    prior to the appellant’s attendance at the home. He was only in the home for
    fifteen minutes. Again, the police testified that this was consistent with a

    essentially flouted the Justice of the Peace’s decision, one that clearly conveyed
    to the police that they did not have reasonable grounds to believe there were controlled
    substances in the apartment. The appellant argues that the denial of the
    warrant to search the residence clearly telegraphed to the police that they did
    not have the grounds for arrest, seeing as the arrest was predicated on the
    fact that the appellant had bought drugs in that location. The appellant maintains
    that the failure to respect the Justice of the Peace’s decision should have
    aggravated the seriousness of the police conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree that the police saw the denial of
    the search warrant as an “invitation” to arrest the next person who came to the
    residence. Rather, the denial of the search warrant caused the police to pursue
    alternative means to advance their investigation. There was nothing wrong with
    doing so. Indeed, the appellant appropriately acknowledges that there is
    nothing inherently wrong with the police using a lawful arrest to advance an
    investigation, even where that arrest is to assist with furnishing the grounds
    upon which a search warrant application may rest. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the police did not simply arrest the
    next person to arrive at the residence. Rather, they set out to arrest the next
    person who they believed to have done a drug transaction in the home. In other
    words, they set out to arrest the next person they had reasonable grounds to
    arrest. Given the short time that the appellant attended at the residence, the
    police believed that he fit the same pattern as the people who they had been
    previously seen coming and going from the residence.  </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The denial of a search warrant does not act as a
    legal declaration that the police are prohibited from using the grounds
    contained within the Information to Obtain the warrant to furnish grounds for
    other purposes. It is important to distinguish between the role of a justice in
    determining whether to issue a search warrant and the role of the police in
    determining whether they have sufficient grounds to arrest. These are two
    fundamentally different acts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When considering whether to issue a search
    warrant, a Justice of the Peace has a specific and discrete job to do: consider
    whether there are sufficient reasonable grounds to support the statutory prerequisites
    to issuance. Justices are not required to give reasons for granting or
    dismissing search warrant applications. Accordingly, it will not always be
    possible to know why a search warrant has been denied. There may be any number
    of reasons for the dismissal of an application, including insufficient grounds
    about the alleged offence, about the location to be searched, whether the items
    to be seized are in the location to be searched and so on. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the other hand, the grounds for arrest
    involve an assessment of all of the circumstances known to the police at the
    time of the arrest. In this case, those circumstances involved information that
    was included in the Information to Obtain the search warrant, but also included
    what the police observed while the warrant was being considered: what appeared
    to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction outside of the home. Determining whether
    the police had sufficient grounds to justify an arrest is a matter that falls
    within the exclusive domain of the trial judge. </span></p>

    police to pause and consider the strength of their grounds in the face of a
    search warrant denial, particularly where their grounds to arrest overlap with
    the grounds for the search warrant, there is nothing inherently wrong with the
    police pursuing other investigative options based upon their own view of the
    facts. In other words, the police are not required to alter what they believe
    (or suspect) to be true, simply because a search warrant has been denied: <em>R.

    where the police have direct insight into why the search warrant was denied
    because the Justice of the Peace gave short reasons for the denial. She said it

    were not, as the appellant suggests, flouting the Justice of the Peace’s
    decision. Indeed, to the contrary, they showed respect for that decision and
    worked toward obtaining further grounds to fill what the Justice of the Peace
    perceived as the gap in the warrant application: evidence respecting the actual

    says that by finding the conduct was not egregious, the trial judge treated the
    negligent conduct as almost a neutral factor in the s. 24(2) analysis. He maintains

    blatant disregard for <em>Charter</em><i> </i>rights …. What is important is
    the proper placement of the police conduct along that fault line, not the legal
    label attached to the conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The placement of the police conduct on the
    spectrum requires an exercise of discretion that the trial judge is uniquely
    positioned to undertake from her or his chair in the courtroom. It was open to
    the trial judge to find, as a fact, that the police were merely “mistaken”
    about whether they had sufficient grounds to arrest and that their conduct was
    worse than “blameless” but less serious than conduct that shows a “wilful” or
    “reckless” or “blatant” disregard for the <em>Charter</em><i>. </i>Rather, it
    was negligent conduct. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not for this court to consider these
    matters afresh. They are findings that are owed deference by this court. I
    would show that deference. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As well, I do not agree with the suggestion that
    all negligent police conduct must push toward exclusion. While negligence
    cannot be equated with good faith (see <em>Grant</em><i>, </i>at para. 75), neither
    can it necessarily be equated with bad faith. The key determining factor is not
    the name given to the conduct, but the underlying findings about the conduct. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Negligent police conduct itself may fall on a
    spectrum. Clear violations of well-established rules governing state conduct
    may exist at one end of a negligence spectrum, while less clear violations of
    less clear rules may be at the other. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, the law surrounding the grounds for arrest
    has been clear for some time: <i>R. v. <em>Storrey</em>, </i>[1990] 1 S.C.R.
    241,<i> </i>at pp. 250-251. But it is a test that is applied using the best
    judgment of police officers, engaged in real time, on the ground policing.
    There is a difference between a police officer miscalculating whether she had
    sufficient grounds to arrest, when on the trial judge’s view she only had
    sufficient grounds to detain for investigation, and other more serious forms of
    police miscalculation. As found by the trial judge, there was nothing cavalier
    or flagrant about the police conduct. Nor was there any pattern of <em>Charter</em><i> </i>breaches. In my view, if the police were short on reasonable grounds to
    arrest, it was by a short distance only. The fact is that the trial judge did
    not find that the level of negligence, a simple, unintentional miscalculation
    as to the strength of the grounds to arrest, rose to the level that would
    aggravate the seriousness of the state-infringing conduct. She is owed
    deference on that point. </span></p>

    erred in concluding beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew about the presence
    of the guns and drugs. He contends that the convictions represent unreasonable
    verdicts because, in this circumstantial case, guilt was not the only
    reasonable inference that the totality of the evidence supported: <em>R. v.
    Villaroman</em><i>, </i>2016 SCC 33, [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at para. 30. </span></p>

    ground of appeal is whether the trier of fact, acting judicially, could

    conclusion available on the totality of the evidence”: <em>Villaroman</em><i>, </i>at

    an accurate review of the law. She well understood that this case turned on
    whether the appellant knew about the contraband. She also quoted directly from <em>Villaroman</em><i>, </i>noting that she had to be satisfied that the accused’s guilt is the only
    reasonable conclusion that she could reach on the totality of the evidence,
    before she could find him guilty. She specifically noted that she was aware
    that not everyone who drives or rides in a car containing concealed objects
    will know of their existence. </span></p>
