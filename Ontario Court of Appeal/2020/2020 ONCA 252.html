lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal concerns an investigation into
    alleged police misconduct. The respondents – Faye Stanley, Yasin Stanley, Yusuf
    Stanley and Taufiq Stanley (collectively “the Stanleys”) – filed complaints
    with the Office of the Independent Police Review Director (“the OIPRD” or “the
    Director”) about a number of police officers.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Stanleys’ complaints arose from the
    execution of a search warrant at their home by members of the Toronto Police
    Service (“TPS”), including Constable Christopher Howes. They alleged excessive
    use of force, the failure to show them the entire contents of the search
    warrant, unnecessary property damage, and other discreditable conduct,
    including a racist threat.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The OIPRD is an independent civilian oversight
    agency that receives, manages, and oversees all public complaints about the
    police in Ontario. It receives its legislative authority from the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Police Services Act</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15
    (“</span><em><span lang=EN-CA>PSA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>”).</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After an investigation, the OIPRD found that an
    allegation that Constable Howes had used excessive force was “substantiated”
    and referred the matter to the Chief of Police of the TPS for a disciplinary
    hearing. The infraction was deemed “serious”. Shortly after the referral, an
    officer from the Professional Standards Unit of the TPS contacted the Director about
    a transcription error in Constable Howes’ statement to the investigators. He
    also asked the Director if the matter could be re-classified as “less serious”,
    allowing for the option of informal resolution by way of discipline without a
    hearing. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Director advised the Stanleys that new
    information had come to light that required further investigation, but he did
    not disclose who brought this information to his attention. Following a further
    investigation, the Director determined that the allegation against Constable
    Howes was now “unsubstantiated” and advised the Stanleys of his decision. The
    file was closed. There was no disciplinary hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Stanleys sought judicial review of the
    Director’s second decision in the Divisional Court. That court framed the
    issues as follows: (1) whether the OIPRD had authority to re-open the
    investigation and reconsider its initial decision; (2) whether there was a
    breach of procedural fairness arising from the OIPRD’s dealings with the TPS in
    the course of re-opening the investigation and reconsidering the initial decision;
    and (3) whether the new decision was reasonable, both in terms of the
    allegation against Constable Howes, and in relation to the search warrant issue.
    The Divisional Court allowed the application on the procedural fairness ground.
    It set aside the Director’s “decisions” and ordered the OIPRD to conduct a third
    investigation using investigators not previously involved in the case.
    Moreover, it ordered that a delegate of the Director decide whether the case
    should be referred to the TPS for a disciplinary hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The OIPRD appeals this decision, supported by
    the TPS and Constable Howes. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><a
name="_Hlk37935617"><span lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would allow the appeal in part. I would uphold
    that part of the Divisional Court’s decision setting aside the Director’s
    second decision (i.e., finding that the allegation against Constable Howes was
    “unsubstantiated”). However, I would do so for different reasons than the
    Divisional Court. The Director lacked any authority to reconsider his decision
    to refer the case to the TPS for a disciplinary hearing. The Director was </span></a><em><span
lang=EN-CA>functus officio</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. Although the OIPRD has
    since amended its Rules of Procedure to permit the type of reconsideration at
    issue on this appeal, that power did not exist when the Director dealt with the
    Stanleys’ complaints. However, I would set aside that part of the Divisional
    Court’s decision ordering that a third investigation be conducted. In the
    circumstances, it is unnecessary to directly address the procedural fairness
    issue.</span></p>

    Stanley was unlawfully in possession of a firearm. A warrant was obtained. On
    April 25, 2014, just after midnight, the police broke down the front door of
    the Stanleys’ house and 19 police officers, many from the Emergency Task Force,
    rushed inside. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Faye Stanley had been sleeping and was awakened
    by her son, Yasin, who told her that the police were at the door with their
    firearms drawn. When the police ascended the stairs, Faye and Yasin were
    ordered to the ground. Faye was eventually allowed to sit on her bed. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Yasin, who was close by, asked if he could get
    up as well. He said that an officer stomped on his neck while he was handcuffed.
    Faye described it differently. She said the officer put his foot on Yasin’s
    neck and then pushed down, but she could not tell how hard. Both Yasin and Faye
    complained about this treatment to the officers.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Faye was asked to move the family dog from one
    room to another. When Yasin commented on what was happening, a white police
    officer (allegedly Constable Howes) yelled “shut up” and stomped on his neck.
    Faye said she witnessed this incident. Yasin further alleged that, when the dog
    was being moved, the same officer leaned down and whispered, “Shut the fuck up,
    or I will put you in a hole with the rest of them, n…..” Faye saw the officer
    lean down to speak to her son, but she did not hear what was said.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The officers did not locate any firearms in the
    Stanleys’ home. No charges were laid.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Yasin was eventually taken to the hospital in an
    ambulance, wearing a neck brace. He was released later that morning, having
    been diagnosed with a “contusion/minor head injury”.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to the alleged assault on Yasin, the
    Stanleys complained about the damage caused to their possessions while the
    police executed the warrant. They alleged other discreditable conduct,
    including inappropriate remarks about the tidiness of their home. Lastly, Faye
    complained that, although she was shown the search warrant, she was not shown
    the appendices. </span></p>

  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Stanleys filed complaints with the OIPRD on
    July 3, 2014. The allegations were investigated and resulted in an investigative
    report, dated March 4, 2015 (“the first report”). The 118-page report contains
    a thorough review of the evidence of the Stanleys, civilian witnesses (i.e., paramedics),
    and 19 police officers. Of the numerous allegations made by the Stanleys, the Director
    determined that only one of the allegations was substantiated. The first report
    concludes: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The available information indicates that
    Constable Howes stepped on Yasin’s neck two times. His actions and the force
    are deemed unnecessary and unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Therefore, with the respect to the allegation
    of Unnecessary Exercise of Authority against Constable Howes, upon review of
    all available information, the Director has determined that there is <b><u>sufficient
    evidence</u></b> to conclude that misconduct occurred. Therefore this
    allegation is found to be <b><u>substantiated.</u></b> [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>All other allegations were determined
    to be “unsubstantiated”.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 4, 2015, the Director wrote to the
    Stanleys to inform them that he had completed his investigation. He said: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>After careful investigation I have found that
    there is evidence of misconduct of a serious nature as it relates to Constable
    Chris Howes, Badge 7716, as defined by the <em>Police Services Act</em>…A final
    report has been completed and will be forwarded to the Chief of the Toronto
    Police Service for adjudication. A copy of the report is attached to this
    letter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span lang=EN-CA>The letter also explained that there
    was “insufficient evidence for me to determine that there are reasonable
    grounds to believe” that any other misconduct occurred. The Stanleys were told
    that a prosecutor would contact them in the near future. </span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the same day, the Director sent a letter to
    the Chief of the TPS, to the attention of Acting Inspector Russell Jarosz of
    the Professional Standards Unit, advising of his findings. The Director indicated
    that the allegation of excessive force against Constable Howes was
    substantiated and had been classified as serious and, pursuant to s. 68(3) of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>PSA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, a hearing must
    be scheduled.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The facts giving rise to this appeal occurred in
    the days that followed. On March 10, 2015, Acting Inspector Jarosz sent the
    following email to the Director:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Superintendent Ed Boyd and I have had the
    opportunity to review your March 4, 2015, report of investigation with regard
    to the above noted matter. We have some concerns with regard to the
    investigative findings and would like to discuss the matter with you at your
    earliest convenience. I am suggesting a conference call if that is most
    convenient for you.</span></p>
  <p class=AAAJudgmentPara><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>What occurred next is not entirely clear because
    no record was kept. It would appear that a conference call did occur, during which
    Acting Inspector Jarosz identified an error in the transcription in Constable
    Howes’ statement to OIPRD investigators. The purported error went to whether
    Constable Howes perceived Yasin to be assaultive and a threat. Acting Inspector
    Jarosz also requested that the matter be treated as “less-serious”, permitting the
    possibility of a disposition without hearing. However, this would require Constable
    Howes’ consent. Acting Inspector Jarosz said he would communicate this option
    to Constable Howes. This conference call was followed up in a March 25, 2015
    letter from Acting Inspector Jarosz to the Director in which he thanked him for
    “revisiting your decision of March 4, 2015”. </span></p>

    that one of the allegations set out in Faye Stanley’s complaint, namely that she
    was not shown the search warrant in its entirety, was not fully investigated.</span></p>

    used excessive force, as well as the lack of a proper investigation of Faye
    Stanley’s complaint about the search warrant. The Director specifically
    referred to issues concerning Constable Howes’ statement, but did not mention
    that the issue arose through communications with the TPS. The Director
    explained his authority to re-visit his decision in the following passage: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I have carefully considered your position that
    I not have the authority to reopen my investigation. <b><u>With respect, I
    disagree. While you are correct that neither the <i>Police Services Act</i> (the “PSA”) nor the OIPRD Rules of Procedure explicitly set out the authority
    for doing so, neither do they explicitly preclude it. Importantly, section 72
    of the PSA permits me to direct the chief of police to deal with a complaint in
    the manner in which I specify, before a hearing under subsection 66(3) or 68(5)
    is commenced.</u></b> The Divisional Court in <i>Figueiras v. (York) Police
    Service Board</i> [2013 ONSC 7419, at paras. 56-57(Div. Ct.)] affirmed that

    to the chief of police and those which have been retained by the OIPRD.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><b><u><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to my statutory authority
    derived from subsection 72 of the PSA, I take the position that I have common
    law authority to suspend my investigative finding and reopen my investigation.</span></u></b><span

    investigative stage, not an adjudicative one. This decision is very different
    from the caselaw respecting the inability of administrative tribunals to change
    their decisions after a hearing on the merits. Rather, my investigative decision
    is akin to a decision made during a criminal investigation, which is always
    ongoing and does not end once a charge is laid [citing <i>Hill v.

    view, the determination of whether reasonable grounds exist to believe
    misconduct has been committed, and the concomitant decision of whether to refer
    the case to the chief of police for a disciplinary hearing, cast the Director
    in a more enhanced decision-making role, even if it falls short of

    to conduct a hearing. There was no longer any investigation to “take over”. Again,
    the power in s. 72(1) is triggered by an investigative referral. It has no

    disjoined from the requirement that the complaint must first be referred to a
    chief of police under s. 61(5)(a) or (b) (for investigation). Admittedly, the
    reference in s. 72(1) to a hearing under s. 68(5) is confusing. However, it may
    be explained by a scenario whereby an investigation was initially referred to a

    retained by the OIRPD and then referred to a chief of police for hearing. As
    the court said, at para. 57: “Neither the language of the legislation nor the policies

    investigative referral in the first place, the Director is powerless to

    provide for reconsideration of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>substantiated</span></em><span

    police force from which the OIPRD was required to maintain its independence. The
    entire situation might have been avoided had the Director advised the Stanleys
    of exactly what had happened. When Mr. Love responded to the Director’s letter
    informing the Stanleys of his decision to re-open his investigation, he said:
    “The circumstances which caused these ‘inaccuracies’ to come to your attention

    inaccuracies to the Director’s attention, nor did he follow up with a further
    inquiry. They essentially assert that the factual lacuna was Mr. Love’s fault.
    I reject this approach. Mr. Love raised legitimate concerns. He did so in a
    temperate and professional manner. As it turned out, he was on solid legal
    ground. Irrespective of the dictates of procedural fairness, he deserved an

    attempting to act in the public interest, into one that quite reasonably

lang=EN-CA>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would uphold the Divisional Court’s decision
    to set aside the Director’s decision made on December 10, 2015. However, I
    would set aside the Divisional Court’s order requiring the Director to conduct
    a fresh investigation. There would be little point in ordering a third
    investigation now that almost six years have passed since the underlying events
    took place. Memories will have faded or have been tainted by the interview
    process that has already transpired.</span></p>

    Director’s original decision of March 4, 2015, referring the complaint against
    Constable Howes to the Chief of Police for a hearing, pursuant to s. 68(3) of
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>PSA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. </span></p>

    hearing, the case is not transported back to 2015. The Director now has the
    authority of reconsideration under r. 17. Procedural laws are intended to have
    immediate effect and avoid the strictures of retrospectivity: see </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Peel (Police) v. Ontario (Special Investigations Unit</span></em><i><span

    (7th) 1, at paras. 186-191. Consequently, there is no barrier to the Director applying
    the new Rules of Procedure to this case.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Director was aware of the transcription
    error with respect to Constable Howes’ statement before formally re-opening his
    investigation. As early as the internal Investigative Review written in April
    or May of 2015 (referred to in para. 22, above), the Director learned of the
    problem. If the Director determines that it is in the public interest to do so,
    he may exercise his discretion under r. 17.2 to reconsider his original
    decision to refer the matter to the TPS for a hearing.</span></p>

    decision of the Divisional Court does not address the doctrine of <i>functus
