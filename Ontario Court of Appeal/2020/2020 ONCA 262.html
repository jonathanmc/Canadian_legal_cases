  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>introduction</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with seven counts relating
    to her involvement in sexual offences committed by two of her male
    acquaintances against her minor daughter and nine counts relating to her
    conduct during the course of the resulting police investigation. She was
    convicted of the following ten offences: one count of sexual assault, two
    counts of criminal negligence, two counts of failing to provide the necessaries
    of life, one count of child abandonment, two counts of obstructing a peace
    officer, and two counts of obstructing justice. The convictions for failing to provide
    the necessaries of life and child abandonment were conditionally stayed
    pursuant to the principle in <em>R. v. Keinapple</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. She
    was sentenced to a global period of incarceration of 6.5 years.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals her convictions and seeks
    leave to appeal her sentence. She also brings a motion to adduce fresh evidence
    regarding her cognitive and executive function and her alleged impaired ability
    to process information. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During oral argument, the appellant abandoned
    the sentence appeal as moot and elected not to proceed with her motion to file
    fresh evidence. She also abandoned five of her ten grounds of appeal. The
    remaining grounds relate primarily to alleged deficiencies in the jury charge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These reasons explain why I would dismiss the
    appeal. In summary, the trial judge properly charged the jury. His instructions
    provided the necessary guidance to effectively adjudicate the charges and, in
    particular, to apply the burden of proof.  While there was a minor legal error
    that became apparent only after the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the law, the
    error had no impact on the overall fairness of the jury charge.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant, SK, was born in Romania in 1995.
    She was adopted by the appellant in 1997. SK lived primarily in Paris, Ontario,
    where she was raised by the appellant and the appellant's elderly parents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2003, the appellant's friend of many years,
    Garry Byer, was imprisoned for allegedly committing sexual assaults. When the
    appellant visited Byer in custody, she brought along SK, who was nine years old
    at the time. The appellant was subsequently introduced to several men who had
    been convicted of sexual offences against children. One of these men, Douglas
    McKenzie, contacted the appellant and SK by phone while he was in custody. Two
    others—Randy Bartley and Gary Hoare, who were also imprisoned and shared cells
    with McKenzie at some point—befriended the appellant and associated with her
    and SK upon their release from jail.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant allowed SK to be alone with
    Bartley and Hoare on many occasions, sometimes for extended periods of time and
    sometimes overnight. When one of the appellant's high school friends met Hoare,
    she suspected he might be a pedophile and contacted the police. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Over the course of the 16-month police
    investigation, the appellant gave seven statements to the police. There were
    many inconsistencies in the statements about how the appellant came to know Bartley
    and Hoare and whether she had ever left the complainant alone with either of them.
    The appellant denied knowledge of any sexual contact between Hoare or Bartley
    and SK. She advised the officers that the complainant never told her about
    anything inappropriate. However, the appellant acknowledged that leaving SK
    with Hoare was a risk and that it demonstrated a lack of judgment on her part. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Following the lengthy police investigation,
    several charges were laid against Hoare, Bartley, and, eventually, the
    appellant. Hoare pleaded guilty to one count of invitation to sexual touching
    (on the basis that SK walked in on him masturbating). Bartley pleaded guilty to
    three offences relating to SK: sexual assault, sexual interference, and
    invitation to sexual touching. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s trial centred on a single
    question: what was the appellant’s role in, and knowledge of, SK’s sexual abuse?
    The Crown argued that the appellant knew Bartley and Hoare were child sex
    offenders and nonetheless aided and encouraged them in committing offences
    against SK. She did this by cultivating their relationships with SK and by
    giving them repeated and prolonged access to her. The Crown alleged that by
    exposing her daughter to these men, the offences were objectively foreseeable. Further,
    the appellant's acts and omissions were a significant contributing cause to the
    long-term psychological harm that SK has and will continue to experience. The
    Crown also argued the appellant lied to the police throughout the investigation
    and attempted to prevent authorities from learning the truth by asking the
    complainant and another witness to lie.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence argued the appellant was unaware of
    the alleged inappropriate sexual acts against SK and that, while she did lie to
    police during her interviews, the untruths did not impede the police
    investigation. The appellant did not testify at trial. However, her police interviews
    were admitted into evidence after defence counsel conceded their voluntariness.</span></p>

    Jacquard</em>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at paras. 2, 6. To determine if the jury
    was properly instructed, an appellate court takes a functional approach: it
    asks whether the charge as a whole, in the overall context of the trial (including
    addresses of counsel and the positions they advanced), enabled the jury to
    decide the case according to the law and evidence: <em>Calnen</em>, at para. 9;<i> <em>R. v. Araya</em></i>, 2015 SCC 11, [2015] 1 S.C.R. 581, at para. 39; <em>R.

    determinative of the adequacy of a charge. However, trial counsel's silence is
    often compelling evidence that the failure to include an instruction now sought
    did not actually prejudice the appellant: <em>R. v. Daley</em>, 2007 SCC 53,
    [2007] 3 S.C.R. 523, at para. 58; <em>Jacquard</em>, at para. 38. Counsel are
    expected to fulfill their professional obligations as officers of the court and
    raise any concerns about the adequacy of a charge with the trial judge. A
    pre-charge conference is not a game of gotcha where counsel can sit quietly and
    reserve his or her objection for appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This latter point is particularly important in
    this case. The trial judge afforded both counsel ample opportunity to discuss
    and review the draft jury instructions. It is evident from the record that he
    was open to input and striving to craft a fair charge. I cite, as but one
    example, the trial judge’s decision not to include a full <em>Vetrovec</em> warning, which would have required him to refer to large amounts of independent
    confirmatory evidence. In the face of this record, this court is entitled to
    consider trial counsel’s silence regarding the numerous errors that they now
    allege individually, and cumulatively, entitle the appellant to a new trial: <em>Adan</em>,

    provides that if the jury does not believe the accused’s testimony or other
    exculpatory evidence, but this evidence raises a reasonable doubt, the jury
    must acquit. The Alberta Court of Appeal’s recent reformulation of the <em>W.D. </em>test in <em>R. v. Ryon</em>, 2019 ABCA 36, 371 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at para. 38,
    clarifies the underlying objective of this step:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[W]hen assessing exculpatory evidence jurors
    should understand that they have three choices, not two: they may accept the
    evidence, they may reject it, or they may find themselves unsure whether the
    evidence is true or false. In other words, there is a “third alternative” to
    confident acceptance or confident rejection and if they find themselves in this
    middle ground that usually means they have a reasonable doubt that must benefit
    the accused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, the second step ensures jurors understand

lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Regarding the negligence-based charges, Bartley testified
    that the appellant knew about his previous criminal convictions for sexual
    offences involving children and that he showed her the medication he was on to
    reduce his sex drive. Bartley also testified about his relationship with SK and
    the appellant’s knowledge about that relationship. His evidence demonstrated
    that the appellant had the opportunity to observe many red flags that pointed
    to an inappropriate relationship. These include the fact that he kept a lock of
    SK’s hair, he hung a picture of her on the wall, he would kiss her goodbye when
    she left, and he had at least one inappropriate conversation with SK regarding
    her private parts. </span></p>

    evidence on its own was capable of leaving the jury with a reasonable doubt
    about the appellant’s guilt on any of the negligence-based charges. Indeed, even
    if the jury accepted Bartley's testimony, they could still find, beyond a
    reasonable doubt, that the appellant acted with a reckless disregard for SK’s
    well-being by leaving SK in Bartley’s care. A </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>W.D.</span></em><span

    actual knowledge of some of the facts that formed the guilty plea's Agreed
    Statement of Facts. </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>I note
    that in the portion of the jury charge related to the sexual assault charge,
    the trial judge focuses on Bartley’s denials. He then explicitly instructs the
    jury that unless they are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Barley
    sexually assaulted SK, they must acquit. He went on to say that without SK’s
    sexual assault, there would have been no offence for the appellant to aid or
    abet. </span></p>

    testimony could potentially raise doubt about his guilt on the sexual assault offence.
    For example, he testified that he is not sexually attracted to underage girls. He
    also explained that he pleaded guilty to the charges related to SK because he
    wanted to avoid a longer sentence and a dangerous offender application. The
    trial judge instructed the jury that Bartley may have had any number of reasons
    for pleading guilty. </span></p>

    Bartley's denial of sexually assaulting SK left them with a reasonable doubt,

    with the appellant. But he left open the possibility that someone else could
    have told her. Hoare also testified about his relationship with SK. As with
    Bartley, several pieces of evidence suggested a possible inappropriate
    relationship with SK. For example, he bought SK presents, including a cell
    phone. Hoare also admitted that he walked around the appellant’s Paris home
    naked and that both the appellant and SK caught him doing so. </span></p>

    reckless disregard for SK’s well-being. Accordingly, no </span><em><span

lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The next issue is whether a <em>W.D.</em> instruction was required regarding the appellant’s police statements. Again, a
    question arises about whether these denials actually amounted to exculpatory
    evidence. I say this because part of the Crown’s theory was that the appellant
    was willfully blind. In nearly every instance where the appellant denied
    knowledge, it was arguable that the circumstances she admitted to pointed
    strongly to her being willfully blind. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the purposes of my analysis, I accept that
    the appellant’s police statements contained potentially exculpatory evidence.
    In my view, they are correctly identified as “mixed” out-of-court statements. Some
    of their contents are inculpatory while other parts are exculpatory: <em>R. v.
    M.P.</em>, 2018 ONCA 608, 363 C.C.C. (3d) 61, at para. 61.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application of <em>W.D.</em> is
    straightforward in the classic scenario where a complainant alleges that the
    accused engaged in criminal conduct and the accused denies the allegation
    completely. But with mixed out of court statements, the application of <em>W.D. </em>is more nuanced because the exculpatory aspects of the statement are
    inextricably intertwined with the inculpatory aspects. Watt J.A. writing for this
    court in <em>M.P.</em><b>, </b>at para. 61, considered the requirement for a <em>W.D.</em> instruction for mixed out of court statements: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A <span style='background:white'>second point
    concerns instructions about the evidentiary value of a “mixed” out-of-court
    statement of an accused. A “mixed” statement is one in which some of the
    contents are inculpatory and other parts exculpatory. Instructions on the
    exculpatory portions of the statement must make it clear that these parts of
    the statement retain their evidentiary value in exculpation as long as the jury
    does not reject them as untrue: <i>R. v. Bucik</i>, <span style='color:black'>2011
    ONCA 546, 274 C.C.C. (3d) 421, at paras. 32-34.</span> But the failure of a
    trial judge expressly to instruct the jury in these terms is not necessarily a
    fatal blow to a conviction provided that the charge, as a whole, makes the
    burden of proof in relation to reasonable doubt and issues of credibility clear
    to the jury and does not leave the case for them to decide on an “either/or”
    basis: <i>R. v. B.(P.)</i>, </span>2016 ONCA 12,<span style='background:white'> 346 O.A.<span style='color:black'>C. 1, at para. 14.</span></span></span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the trial judge correctly
    described the burden of proof. He accurately explained the concept of
    reasonable doubt and made it clear that it could arise from the totality of the
    evidence or the absence of evidence. He made specific reference to the exhibits,
    which included the appellant's statements. In reviewing the evidence, the trial
    judge also referenced the potentially exculpatory portions of the appellant’s statements.
    He also reviewed each element of every offence in the multi-count indictment
    and explicitly linked the reasonable doubt requirement to each element. </span></p>

    were obligated to acquit. In fact, they did acquit on one of the counts. In

    evidence relevant to that charge. Moreover, when the trial judge reviewed the
    evidence at length, he referred to the lies, many of which were admitted by the
    time of trial, only in respect of the obstructing justice charges. Importantly,
    the defence did not request a no probative value instruction and did not object

    judge noted that the facts of this case are not typical of a charge of
    negligence causing bodily harm. Despite his reservations, the trial judge decided
    to leave the counts with the jury. He found the jury could consider only:</span></p>

    omissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that approaching the issue
    in this way was problematic and prejudicial. The appellant concedes that bodily
    harm includes psychological harm: <em>R. v. McCraw</em>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72 at
    p. 80. However, she argues that considering the complainant's condition at the
    time of trial invariably entailed a future-based analysis going beyond the harm
    that was inflicted at the time of the offences, which occurred years earlier.
    According to the appellant, the date of the trial was an arbitrary line with
    which to assess whether psychological harm was caused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This submission does not persuade me. The trial
    judge’s instructions made clear that existing, not future, harm was necessary
    for a conviction. The trial judge correctly reviewed the elements of the
    offence and related the relevant evidence to the charges. There was evidence
    available on each element of the offence on which the jury could convict. In
    particular, there was evidence to support the finding that the exposure to
    Bartley and Hoare caused psychological damage to the complainant that was extant
    at the time of trial.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant makes one additional argument on
    this ground of appeal. She submits that the harm caused must be immediate. In
    support of that submission counsel referred to a driving case from this court: <em>R.
    v. Shilon</em> (2006), 240 C.C.C. (3d) 401 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judge correctly rejected
    this argument. Immediacy of harm may serve to provide evidence of a causal link
    between the criminally negligent act and the bodily harm; however, there is no
    principled reason why it should be considered an essential element of the
    offence. The Crown is free to prove the causal link by other means. In this
    case, the Crown did so through expert evidence that established a causal link
    between the bodily harm suffered by the complainant and the complainant’s exposure
    to Bartley and Hoare.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on the foregoing, I would dismiss this
    ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(IV)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Child Abandonment</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge instructed the jury that the
    appellant’s intent for the child abandonment count was to be assessed objectively.
    However, in <em>R. v. A.D.H.</em>, 2013 SCC 28, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 269—released
    two years after the trial in this case—the Supreme Court ruled that the fault
    element for abandonment must be assessed subjectively.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown concedes that, in light of this
    subsequent jurisprudence, the jury was not correctly instructed on the elements
    of child abandonment. However, the Crown relies on the <em>curative proviso</em> found in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: he submits the error
    was harmless because it could have had no impact on the verdict.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I agree with the Crown’s submission. The subjective
    fault requirement was imposed by the Supreme Court in <em>A.D.H.</em> to ensure
    that only those who commit the offence knowingly or recklessly are punished. In
    this case, the appellant was convicted of the more serious offences of sexual
    assault and criminal negligence causing bodily </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:200%'>harm, <span style='color:black;background:white'>both
    of which require the jury to consider the appellant’s subjective intent.</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black;background:
white'> </span><span lang=EN-CA>In these circumstances, there is no realistic
    possibility that the jury would, if properly instructed, conclude that the
    appellant did not have the requisite subjective intention. Thus, the error was
    of no consequence, and the <em>curative proviso</em> is available. Therefore,
    on this basis, I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the Crown brought an application to
    call expert evidence on two points: (1) the phenomenon of incremental or
    delayed disclosure and (2) the bodily (psychological) harm suffered by the
    complainant. The trial judge denied the application for three reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>one of the proposed experts lacked the

    or delayed disclosure; and, </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the application to adduce evidence of bodily
    harm was premature because it was brought before the complainant's testimony
    and so it was not possible to determine whether the necessity criterion had
    been established.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After SK testified, defence counsel advised that
    she was not conceding the issue of psychological harm. Defence counsel took the
    position that SK’s evidence did not establish that she was suffering the
    requisite degree of bodily harm under any of the offences. As a consequence of
    the defence’s position, the trial Crown renewed its application to call expert
    evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ruled that Dr. Jasmine Eliav, a
    registered child psychologist, could provide expert evidence on the issue of
    harm. Following that ruling, the trial Crown asked whether he could lead
    foundation evidence about Dr. Eliav’s discussions with the complainant. The
    trial judge correctly responded that the “expert opinion evidence is only as
    valuable as the proved foundation upon which it relies” and that if Dr. Eliav
    “testifies to things that have not been proved here, then it will detract from
    its value to the extent that they have not been proved, especially when the
    complainant testified.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>During the course of her testimony, Dr. Eliav testified
    about what the complainant had told her during their therapeutic sessions. The
    appellant says the trial judge should have provided a limiting instruction
    regarding Dr. Eilav’s testimony because there was a significant danger that the
    jury would use it to determine whether the abuse actually occurred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this submission. The
    trial judge instructed the jury how to deal with a situation where the expert
    relies on facts that are different from the facts they find from the evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To the extent that the facts you find are
    different from the facts assumed or relied upon by the expert in reaching his
    or her conclusion, you may consider the expert’s opinion less helpful to you in
    deciding this case. How much or little you believe of or rely upon an expert’s
    opinion is entirely up to you.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on this instruction, I am satisfied the
    jury understood that it was their assessment of the facts that mattered. I am
    also satisfied the jury understood they were not bound to accept facts as
    proven simply because Dr. Eliav relied on them in providing her opinion. Therefore,
    I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</span></p>
