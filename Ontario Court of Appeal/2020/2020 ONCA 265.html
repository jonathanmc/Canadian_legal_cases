  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>overview</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal raises a narrow question. Did the
    trial judge err in holding that the respondent (Ms. Pucci) was entitled to payment
    of household and attendant care expenses for the time period prior to judgment,
    even if Ms. Pucci had not actually incurred those expenses? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would allow the appeal. With respect, the
    trial judge erred in holding the expenses had been incurred. She made that
    finding without regard to the definition of incurred in s. 3(7)(e) of the <em>Statutory
    Accident Benefit Schedule</em>, O. Reg 34/10<i> </i>(<em>SABS-2010</em>). The
    trial judge further erred in holding, in any event, those expenses should be
    deemed to have been incurred under s. 3(8) of the <em>SABS</em><i>-2010</i>. In
    making that finding, the trial judge misapprehended material evidence and
    failed to consider a significant body of evidence relevant to the
    reasonableness inquiry mandated by s. 3(8).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I am also satisfied this court cannot make the
    factual findings necessary to determine whether the payment of the expenses was
    unreasonably withheld by Wawanesa. I would order a new trial.</span></p>

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>the evidence</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Pucci was in a motor vehicle accident on
    June 16, 2013. She was 22 years old. A vehicle improperly entered the
    intersection and broadsided Ms. Puccis car. Her car was totally destroyed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Pucci went to the hospital. She had back,
    neck, and left thumb pain. She was unsure whether she had briefly lost
    consciousness at the time of the accident. A CAT scan was negative. Ms. Pucci
    was released from hospital on the same day.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the days, weeks, and months after the
    accident, Ms. Puccis condition worsened dramatically. Her physical symptoms
    continued. New symptoms suggestive of some kind of brain trauma appeared. For
    example, she temporarily lost vision in one eye. Most significantly, Ms. Pucci
    began to experience severe, debilitating, emotional and behavioural problems.
    Her speech, and then her behaviour, regressed to that of a young child. Her speech
    slowed noticeably and her thought processes became obviously impaired. Ms.
    Pucci had difficulty controlling her emotions and sometimes was oblivious to
    her surroundings. She also had trouble remembering things and often could not
    make even the most basic personal decisions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Ms. Pucci became unable to work or go to school.
    She could not look after her basic needs without help. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no suggestion that Ms. Pucci was
    fabricating or exaggerating her conditions and symptoms. The two psychiatrists who
    testified at trial agreed Ms. Puccis symptoms met the criteria for conversion
    and somatic disorders, both major mental disorders. They also agreed Ms.
    Puccis condition related more to her psychiatric and emotional problems than
    to the physical sequela of the accident. Finally, the two experts agreed Ms.
    Pucci was unable to work or look after herself.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The two experts disagreed about the connection,
    if any, between Ms. Puccis catastrophic impairment and her accident. Ms. Pucci
    had struggled, with intermittent success, to overcome several longstanding psychiatric
    and emotional problems pre-existing the car accident for many years. Dr.
    Feinstein, the expert called by Ms. Pucci, described the effect of those
    pre-accident conditions on Ms. Puccis post-accident condition:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>And here, pre-accident psychological factors
    loom large. Ms. Puccis psychiatric history during her teenage years is a
    troubled one characterized by significant emotional trauma, related symptomatology,
    problematic relationships, severe substance abuse necessitating the use of methadone
    and extensive contact with mental health specialists. This history suggests she
    was highly vulnerable from a psychological perspective when the accident of
    June 16, 2013 occurred. This premorbid vulnerability should therefore be viewed
    as a key factor in understanding why her post-accident reactions had been so
    maladaptive and regressed. While Ms. Puccis pre-accident psychiatric history
    alone cannot explain her current presentation, it has nevertheless contributed
    to it.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his report and testimony, Dr. Feinstein
    indicated Ms. Puccis treatment team had incorrectly diagnosed her condition as
    attributable primarily to physical brain trauma suffered in the accident. He
    believed Ms. Puccis condition flowed primarily from a pre-existing cycle of psychopathology,
    properly described as somatic and conversion disorder. Dr. Feinstein also testified
    Ms. Puccis pre-accident condition was exacerbated by the significant chronic
    pain and emotional turmoil directly associated with the accident and the physical
    injuries suffered in the accident. In Dr. Feinsteins opinion, Ms. Puccis
    treatment program should move from one centered on treating disabling cerebral 
    trauma to one focusing on the major underlying psychiatric issues. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Dr. Ozersky, Wawanesas expert, opined that Ms.
    Puccis symptomatology reflected her underlying psychiatric problems and were
    not the product of injury caused by the accident. In his report, Dr. Ozersky
    acknowledged the significant deterioration in Ms. Puccis condition
    post-accident, but said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find it hard to imagine that an accident of
    this nature could be responsible for this womans psychological regression,
    neither do I believe there is any head injury involved of any significance.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nowhere in the report does Dr. Ozersky explain
    what he meant when he said the accident was not responsible for Ms. Puccis psychiatric
    condition. In his testimony, he explained his understanding of causation:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>My test is on the
    balance of probabilities, was the accident responsible for her conversion
    disorder</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>? And my answer would be no, it was not
    responsible. Her pre-existing history of sexual assault, drug abuse,
    depressions thats what, working, those factors working together created the
    circumstance for a conversion disorder. <span class=Underline>The accident may
    have been the a trigger but in itself it would not be sufficient to cause a
    conversion disorder</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As I understand Dr. Ozerskys evidence, he believed
    the accident was not responsible for Mr. Puccis subsequent psychiatric
    disorders for two reasons. First, he believed Ms. Puccis pre-accident condition
    put her on the edge of total emotional disintegration such that the slightest event
    could push her into the psychiatric disorders she developed post-accident. Consequently,
    because she was so close to disintegration, the accident could not be said to
    be responsible for her condition, even though it triggered the development of
    that condition. Second, Dr. Ozersky explained that the accident was not
    responsible for Ms. Puccis condition because the accident alone could not have
    caused that condition. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge, after reviewing the evidence of
    the two experts, accepted Dr. Feinsteins opinion that Ms. Puccis conversion
    disorder was triggered by the motor vehicle accident. The trial judge, at para.
    83, referred to the accident as the tipping point in the plaintiffs ability
    to function on a day-to-day basis. She said, at para. 84:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I conclude that, but for the collision, Ms.
    Pucci would not have suffered the conversion disorder described by her
    physicians. This disorder catastrophically impairs her ability to function from
    a mental or behavioural perspective.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Wawanesa does not challenge the trial judges
    finding that, for the purposes of determining Ms. Puccis entitlements under
    the <em>SABS-2010</em>, the accident was the direct cause of her subsequent
    condition,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-CA
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a> or that the condition renders her catastrophically impaired. </span></p>

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>ms. puccis accident benefits claim</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the time of the accident, Ms. Pucci was insured
    under a motor vehicle policy issued by Wawanesa. A representative of Wawanesa
    visited Ms. Pucci within days of the accident to provide information about her
    coverage. Ms. Puccis doctor submitted a disability certificate to Wawanesa,
    describing the nature of Ms. Puccis injuries and explaining that she could not
    work. Wawanesa immediately provided income replacement at the rate required
    under the <em>SABS-2010</em>, as of the date of the accident.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Based on information provided from time-to-time
    by Ms. Puccis doctors, assessments done for Wawanesa, and treatment plans
    provided to Wawanesa, Wawanesa classified Ms. Pucci as eligible for the maximum
    household expenses and attendant care benefits available under the <em>SABS-2010</em> to persons who had not been characterized as catastrophically injured. Under
    the <em>SABS-2010</em>, attendant care costs for persons not catastrophically

    have Ms. Pucci assessed. That assessment involved a series of examinations
    performed by different experts appointed by Wawanesa. </span></p>

    where Ms. Pucci lived. On the morning that the assessors were to fly to Thunder
    Bay, one of them suffered a medical condition, necessitating the cancellation
    of the trip. The examinations were completed about eight weeks later in October

    a catastrophic impairment as a result of an accident. Wawanesa acknowledged it
    was required, under the relevant SABS, to pay any attendant care and
    housekeeping benefits incurred by Ms. Pucci prior to Wawanesas notification to

    Wawanesa argues, however, that while the trial judge properly limited payments for
    housekeeping and attendant care post-judgment to expenses incurred, she erred
    in failing to place the same limitation on any amounts owed in reference to
    those benefits for the pre-judgment period from February 2016 to March 2019.
    Wawanesa submits Ms. Pucci is entitled to expenses for that period only to the
    extent she actually incurred those expenses. The Agreed Statement of Facts
    filed at trial states that Ms. Pucci paid about $29,000 for attendant care in
    2018. There is no evidence of any payments made by Ms. Pucci for

    had acted unreasonably in withholding payments based exclusively on Dr.
    Ozerskys causation opinion. Counsel highlighted certain alleged shortcomings
    in the report and in Dr. Ozerskys approach to his task. Counsel also
    emphasized Dr. Ozerskys causation opinion conflicted with the opinion of other
    experts, some of whom had been retained by Wawanesa in the course of its
    management of Ms. Puccis benefits claim. Counsel submitted Wawanesa acted
    unreasonably in accepting, apparently without question, Dr. Ozerskys opinion when
    his opinion was inconsistent with the position Wawanesa had taken in the first
    two years of its management of Ms. Puccis benefits claim.</span></p>

    of the <em>SABS-2010</em> in the part of her reasons that addressed Ms. Puccis
    entitlement to the various benefits. The trial judge did not, however, address
    Ms. Puccis submission that reliance on Dr. Ozerskys opinion constituted an
    unreasonable withholding or delaying of payment of a benefit in all of the
    circumstances. Instead, as I read her reasons, the trial judge focused on two
    things in determining that Wawanesa had unreasonably withheld payments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, at paras. 107-108, the trial judge
    referred to what she described as the unfairness in reimbursing only insured
    persons who were able to fund their own expenses while the dispute with their
    insurer over their entitlement to benefits was ongoing. Second, the trial judge
    referred specifically to the delay in providing the defence catastrophic
    impairment assessments. She said, at para. 108:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While an insurer is entitled to seek its own
    opinions to determine liability under a policy, a delay of nine months to
    produce the report is not reasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the trial judges assessment of the fairness
    of the scheme for payment of expenses established under the <em>SABS-2010</em> is irrelevant to whether the insurer acted unreasonably in withholding or
    delaying payments. The scheme is predicated on the repayment of expenses incurred
    within the very specific definition provided in s. 3(7)(e). The scheme does not
    create entitlement to payment based on need or a damages-like assessment of the
    insureds entitlements. Whatever the merits of the policy reflected in the current
    scheme, the operation of that policy in a given case does not assist in
    determining whether an insurer acted unreasonably in withholding payments. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I turn next to the trial judges finding that
    the nine-month delay in producing the reports was not reasonable. She made no
    reference to the evidence in making this finding. Nor had counsel for Ms. Pucci
    argued that any delay in providing the reports made the refusal to pay the
    benefits unreasonable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I have reviewed the relevant evidence above (see
    para. 20). The examinations began in May 2015 but did not end until late
    October 2015. The completion of the examinations took some time, first, because
    Ms. Pucci was physically unable to complete the assessments in July, and
    second, because one of the testers retained by Wawanesa fell ill on the day he
    was scheduled to fly to Thunder Bay to complete those tests and could not fly
    to Thunder Bay. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The delay in completing the assessments between
    May 2015 and October 2015 cannot be attributed to any inappropriate,
    unnecessary, or unreasonable conduct by Wawanesa. One might argue that it took
    longer than it should have to prepare the reports after the assessments were
    completed (end of October 2015 to early February 2016). There was no evidence
    on this point. However, even if the reports should have been prepared somewhat
    more quickly, there is no basis in the evidence for the trial judges finding that

    judge relied on factors other than the delay in obtaining the necessary reports

    that the meaning of incur in the case law prior to the enactment of s.
    3(7)(e) can assist in assessing the reasonableness of Wawanesas conduct for
    the purposes of s. 3(8). The overtaken case law provided a broad definition of
    incurred. Under that definition, expenses could be incurred, even though they
    were not paid for or received. Section 3(8) applies only where expenses were
    not incurred and looks to the reasonableness of the insurers conduct. Case law
    which provided a meaning of incurred in the absence of a statutory meaning had

    that by paying the expenses in the first two years post-accident, Wawanesa
    waived any right to assert that the accident was not a direct cause of Ms.
    Puccis admittedly catastrophic condition. Second, counsel submits Wawanesa, by
    paying the benefits for the first 104 weeks, is estopped from challenging causation
    at the catastrophic impairment stage of the process. Third, counsel relies on
    the language of s. 45 of the <em>SABS-2010</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>An insured person who sustains an impairment
    as a result of an accident may apply to the insurer for a determination of
    whether the impairment is a catastrophic impairment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel contends that s. 45 precludes any
    causation inquiry at the catastrophic impairment inquiry. On counsels
    interpretation, only the nature and extent of the impairment can be addressed
    at that point in the SABS process. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I begin with s. 45. I do not read the section as
    requiring the insurer, at the catastrophic injury phase of the process, to
    accept the impairment in issue was caused by the accident. I read the opening
    language of the section, which requires the insured to have sustained an
    impairment as a result of an accident, as setting down a precondition to the
    bringing of an application for the determination that the insured has suffered
    a catastrophic impairment. Under the generally applicable principles of proof,
    it falls to the insured, as the party seeking the determination of catastrophic
    impairment, to demonstrate the existence of the pre-condition. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Apart from the language of s. 45, there could be
    significant harm to the fair and efficient operation of the SABS benefit scheme
    if payments of benefits post-accident by the insurer were to be taken as
    foreclosing any causation-based argument at some later point in the process. Were
    that interpretation of s. 45 to prevail, I would think it would strongly disincentivize
    the timely payment of benefits in the immediate aftermath of accidents. Prudent
    insurers, before making any payments for expenses referable to benefits claimed,
    would first fully explore any potential causation-related issues. Resolving
    those issues can require significant input from experts. That exercise takes
    time.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The waiver and estoppel arguments must also
    fail. This court recently considered both doctrines in the context of the
    insured/insurer relationship: <em>Bradfield v. Royal Sun Alliance Insurance
    Company of Canada</em>, 2019 ONCA 800, 148 O.R. (3d) 161. I need not repeat the
    principles summarized in <em>Bradfield</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Waiver has no application. There is no evidence that
    Wawanesa knew, or had reason to believe, that Ms. Puccis condition was not the
    result of her accident, but chose to waive any reliance on the absence of a
    causal connection and make payments according to the policy. Ms. Puccis
    position at trial was not that Wawanesa waived any right it had under the
    policy, but that the causal connection was clearly established and accepted by
    Wawanesa from the outset. The trial judge ultimately accepted her position.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would also reject the estoppel argument.
    Estoppel is essentially an evidence-based claim. Estoppel requires reliance. There
    is no basis in the evidence to suggest that Ms. Pucci relied, to her detriment,
    on anything done by Wawanesa. To the contrary, at the appropriate time in the
    process, she initiated the catastrophic impairment determination. In doing so,
    she advanced a full and ultimately convincing case for a finding that her
    condition was the direct result of the accident. She was not prejudiced by
    anything done by Wawanesa in advancing that position.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The waiver and estoppel arguments also fail for
    another reason. On the appeal, Wawanesa accepts Ms. Pucci was catastrophically
    injured as a result of the car accident. To the extent that estoppel or waiver
    might have application, they would foreclose Wawanesa from arguing that the
    causal connection was not established. Wawanesa does not make that argument on
    appeal.</span></p>

    but as one of the factors to be considered in determining whether Wawanesa

    from the evidence, as long as those inferences are not inconsistent with any
    finding made by the trial judge that has not been set aside by this court. In
    this appeal, the court could first set aside the trial judges finding that
    Wawanesa acted unreasonably in withholding the benefits because that finding
    was based on a material misapprehension of the evidence and a failure to
    consider relevant evidence, and then, on its own review of the evidentiary
    record, make a finding that Wawanesa did act unreasonably. If the court exercised

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship between an insurer and an

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The duty of good faith also requires an
    insurer to deal with its insureds claim fairly. The duty to act fairly applies
    both to the manner in which the insurer investigates and assesses the claim and
    to the decision whether or not to pay the claim. In making a decision whether
    to refuse payment of a claim from its insured, an insurer must assess the
    merits of the claim in a balanced and reasonable manner. It must not deny
    coverage or delay payment in order to take advantage of the insureds economic
    vulnerability or to gain bargaining leverage in negotiating a settlement. A
    decision by an insurer to refuse payment should be based on a reasonable
    interpretation of its obligations under the policy. This duty of fairness,
    however, does not require an insurer necessarily to be correct in making a
    decision to dispute its obligation to pay a claim. Mere denial of a claim that
    ultimately succeeds is not, in itself, an act of bad faith.</span></p>

    Wawanesa knew that Dr. Ozerskys causation opinion contradicted the position
    Wawanesa had taken for two years. Wawanesa also knew that Dr. Ozerskys opinion
    stood alone. Finally, Wawanesa appreciated Ms. Puccis vulnerability. She was
    catastrophically impaired and very much in need of the household and attendant
    care services she claimed. She could not fund those services on her own. These
    facts dictated that Wawanesa take a long careful look at Dr. Ozerskys

    that the car accident triggered Ms. Puccis condition seems entirely
    inconsistent with the assertion that the car accident did not cause her
    condition. The trial judge specifically referred to Dr. Ozerskys concession in
    cross-examination in finding that the accident was the immediate cause of Ms.
    Puccis condition. </span></p>

    that the accident was not responsible for Ms. Puccis condition. He provided little,
    if any, insight into the analysis that led to that conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his testimony, particularly his

    his report that the accident was not responsible for Ms. Puccis condition. I
    have reviewed Dr. Ozerskys evidence relating to causation earlier in these
    reasons (see paras. 11-13). As summarized, he offered two reasons for his
    opinion that the accident was not responsible for Ms. Puccis condition.
    After acknowledging that the accident triggered the condition, he went on to
    assert that the accident, while a trigger, was not a cause because the
    accident, on its own, would not have caused the conversion disorder. Second,
    Dr. Ozersky testified that the accident was not responsible for Ms. Puccis
    condition because, given her tenuous psychiatric state, had the accident not
    triggered her condition, some other event, even a minor one, would have
    triggered the condition.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It appears to me that the two explanations
    offered by Dr. Ozersky for his conclusion that the accident was not
    responsible for the condition are not medical opinions but are, instead,
    legal opinions about the meaning of causation under s. 3(1) of the <em>SABS-2010</em>.
    Dr. Ozersky was, of course, not qualified to advance legal opinions. Additionally,
    his evidence suggests an understanding of causation that is at odds with the
    meaning given to causation under s. 3(1) in a series of decisions from this
    court: <em>Greenhalgh v. ING Halifax Insurance Company</em> (2014), 243 D.L.R. 
    (4th) 635, at paras. 10-12, 36; <em>Martin v. 2064324 Ontario Inc. (Freeze

    Liberty Mutual</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> (2002), 217 D.L.R.
    (4th) 145</span></em>, at paras. 24-31. Nothing in those cases supports the
    proposition that the proverbial thin skulled driver, who has an accident that
    precipitates or triggers consequences that are particularly dire because of the
    drivers prior medical vulnerability, is not covered under her motor vehicle
    insurance policy.</span></p>

    the reasonableness of Wawanesas refusal to pay the benefits lies in the
    paucity of evidence permitting informed inferences about the steps, if any, Wawanesa
    took to critically review Dr. Ozerskys report, and the steps, if any, counsel
    for Ms. Pucci took to bring the inadequacies in Dr. Ozerskys report to the
    attention of Wawanesa. While the trial judge ultimately rejected Dr. Ozerskys
    opinion, and for good reason, one must bear in mind that he was an admittedly
    qualified expert to whom Wawanesa could legitimately look for a medical opinion
    in respect of causation. Ms. Puccis condition was far from straightforward or
    a common result of a relatively minor accident. Even Dr. Feinstein took a
    significantly different position with respect to the nature of Ms. Puccis
    condition than had earlier experts retained on her behalf.</span></p>

    to proceed to trial once the conflicting opinions had been exchanged. Ms. Pucci

lang=EN-CA> </span>The legislative scheme governing disputes relating to
    entitlement under the <i>SABS-2010</i> has changed (effective April 1, 2016).
    Under the present legislation, the Licence Appeal Tribunal has exclusive
    jurisdiction to resolve disputes over entitlement to benefits under the SABS:
    see <em><span lang=EN-CA>Stegenga v. Economical Mutual Insurance Co.</span></em>,
    2019 ONCA 615. The amendments were motivated, in part, by efforts to speed up
    adjudication of these disputes.</p>

    payment under s. 282(10) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Insurance Act</span></em> (now found in Automobile Insurance, O. Reg. 664, s. 10). That special award is,
    however, predicated on the insurer acting unreasonably in delaying or withhold
    payment. Cases decided under that provision clearly have relevance to the
    assessment required under s. 3(8) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>SABS-2010</span></em>.</p>
