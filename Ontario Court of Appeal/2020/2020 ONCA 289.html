  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS
    FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant started the underlying action in 2016. It revolves largely
    around the disclosure of certain records concerning the appellant by the Children’s
    Aid Society of Toronto. The statement of claim makes a number of claims, and
    the respondents moved for summary judgment. The appellant also brought a motion
    for contempt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The factual context starts with the appellant’s sexual abuse as a
    child<span style='line-height:200%'>, which the motion judge characterized as
    “an historical sexual assault on her by [a relative].” The [relative]</span> was convicted of two counts of sexual assault, one count of sexual interference,
    and sentenced.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Previously, when the appellant was a ward of the Society, she was
    sentenced for offences under the <em>Young Offenders Act</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1.</span></em> The Society’s file
    contained a pre-disposition report prepared for the sentencing, which the
    Society had received in its capacity as parent.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2013, the appellant requested the Society send information to the
    Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to support her claim <em><span
style='font-style:normal'>under the </span></em><em>Compensation for Victims of
    Crime Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.24 for
    compensation for the sexual assault. </span></em>She later discovered that the
    file the Society had disclosed to the Board contained the sensitive
    pre-disposition report and information about her youth criminal offences.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The motion judge
    observed that the appellant’s “real grievance” is that she was unaware that the
    pre-disposition report was in the Society’s file “and is upset that it was
    disclosed, along with the fact that she faced youth criminal justice
    proceedings as a teenager.” The appellant gave us the same impression.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The appellant believes that she is representing the
    interests of many people who are similarly situated and whose records are too
    accessible and disclosable.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s distress at this disclosure sets the background for the
    two appeals before this court. The first relates to the motion judge’s dismissal
    of the appellant’s action in its entirety, with reasons reported at 2019 ONSC
    5138. The second relates to the motion judge’s dismissal of the appellant’s
    contempt motion against the Society, Giovanna Asaro, and Ada Lee, with reasons
    reported at 2019 ONSC 5141.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We address the contempt appeal before the summary judgment appeal.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Jurisdiction over the Contempt Appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the respondents in the contempt appeal argued that the order
    dismissing the appellant’s contempt motion was interlocutory and could only be
    appealed to the Divisional Court, with leave, not to this court: <i>The <em>Catalyst
    Capital Group Inc. v. Moyse</em></i>, 2015 ONCA 784, 127 O.R. (3d) 625, at
    para. 12; <em>Chirico v. Szalas</em>, 2016 ONCA 586, 132 O.R. (3d) 738, at
    paras. 43-48.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The appellant’s motion for contempt and the respondents’ motion to
    dismiss the action were heard on the same day by the same judge, and the
    reasons in both were released on the same day. These are not separate
    proceedings. The motion judge himself recognized in the contempt reasons that:
    “The motion arises out of, and overlaps with, relief sought by the plaintiff in
    this action.” The appeals are intimately related and are better viewed as one
    proceeding that was dismissed by the motion judge in a judgment that is final
    and appealable to this court.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Contempt Appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>On the contempt appeal, the appellant repeated the arguments
    she made to the motion judge. <em><span style='font-style:normal'>He dismissed
    the contempt motion, on the basis that to be in contempt of court, a person or
    institution must disobey a court order: </span></em><em>Rogacki v. Belz</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> (2003), 67 O.R. (3d) 330 (C.A.), at para. 17. There
    were no court orders disobeyed in this case.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>Before he dismissed the contempt motion, the motion
    judge considered each of the appellant’s three contempt complaints carefully. </span></em>The
    first complaint is that the Society transmitted parts of her file to the Board
    in 2013<em><span style='font-style:normal'>, at the appellant’s request, in
    order to support her claim for compensation for the sexual assaults she
    suffered.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The motion judge
    observed that the particular document to which the appellant objects most
    strongly, the pre-disposition report, contained the very information the
    appellant needed in order to be successful in her claim before the Board. In
    his view, the Society’s conduct could not be characterized as contempt on its
    part but is better understood as an effort to be helpful to the appellant. The
    motion judge also found that the Society’s action in sending her file to the
    appellant’s paralegal was similarly not contemptuous.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The appellant’s second complaint is that Ms. Asaro and Ms.
    Lee were contemptuous in serving the Society’s statement of defence in the action
    underlying this appeal on her children because it referred to historical proceedings
    involving the appellant under the <em>Young Offenders Act.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> By serving the statement of defence in this action, the
    appellant argues that the Society contemptuously provided the private
    information about the appellant’s past to her adult children, who are also
    named as plaintiffs.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The service of the
    statement of defence on the plaintiffs was not contemptuous but was obligatory
    under r. 16 of the </span></em><em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. The motion judge noted that
    the court proceedings are subject to a sealing order to protect the appellant’s
    privacy.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The appellant’s third
    contempt complaint is that Ms. Asaro contemptuously failed to personally attend
    before the Ontario Court of Justice in a proceeding respecting the appellant’s
    youth court records. Some context is needed to explain this complaint. The
    Society brought an application under ss. 119 and 123 of the </span></em><em>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, S.C. 2002, c. 1
    in order to be permitted to produce the appellant’s child-in-care file in this
    action. The motion judge did not find that Ms.&nbsp;Asaro had been ordered to
    appear in the Ontario Court of Justice for argument on the return of the
    Society’s application. He also noted that Ms. Asaro could not appear because
    she had sworn an affidavit to be used in the argument before the Ontario Court
    of Justice on the disposition of the youth court record. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>The Ontario Court judge who heard the application
    granted the parties involved in this lawsuit access to the Society’s file in
    order to ensure the “full and fair adjudication and disposition of the issues
    in that proceeding.” He was alive to the privacy issue and added a condition
    that the parties not disclose the records or any information therein to anyone
    “who does not have a direct interest in this civil proceeding.” His order also</span></em> provided:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>3. At the conclusion of the court litigation

  <p class=MsoListNumber2><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>defamation arising from the inclusion and

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge analyzed each of these claims in detail. He found that: “[c]ertain

    the evidence on this motion and there are no genuine issues requiring a trial.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no reason to repeat the motion judge’s analysis. It was compassionately
    expressed. The appellant does not claim that the motion judge made any factual
    errors. Apart from the motion judge’s analysis regarding the disclosure regime
    under the <i>Young Offenders Act </i>and the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>,
    we do not discern any legal errors.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is one point on which the motion judge arguably erred. This relates to the
    effect of s. 38 of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i> and the Society’s obligations
    under it.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Effect of s. 38 of the <i>Young Offenders

  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The appellant disputes both the provision of the
    pre-disposition report to the Society and its subsequent transmission by the
    Society. She argues that the Society breached s. 38 of the <i>Young Offenders
    Act</i> by providing the pre-disposition report to third parties. In the
    appellant’s view, s. 38 of the <em>Young Offenders Act </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>required the destruction of the pre-disposition
    report wherever it was found, including any copies sent to the Society.</span></em> The <i>Young Offenders Act</i> has since been replaced with the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act</i>. Section 138(1) of the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i> makes it an offence to publish the identity of an offender, contrary to s.&nbsp;38(1)
    (identity not to be published) of the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

normal'>, s. 119(1)(e). While the Society complied with its statutory
    obligations in its indefinite retention of the appellant’s child-in-care file,
    the appellant argues and pleads that the Society wrongfully disclosed the pre-disposition
    report to the Board.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

style='line-height:200%'>Youth Criminal Justice Act</span></em><em><span

    circumstances.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span

    fourth issue is whether the Society was obliged to seek judicial authorization permitting
    it to disclose the pre-disposition report to the Board, even if</span></em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> the appellant had arguably requested the Society to
    disclose information to the Board. The </span></em><span style='line-height:

    the findings from their investigation of the allegations; (b) any psychological
    assessments they have for [the appellant] in their files.” The appellant copied
    this passage almost verbatim in her letter to the Society asking it to “please
    forward the information the Board is requesting …” and to provide <u>her</u> with “a copy of [her] file.” </span>She also attached a copy of the Board’s
    letter in her correspondence to the Society.<span style='line-height:200%'> However,
    the Society provided copies of several documents from the appellant’s file to
    the Board, not the summary the Board requested.</span></p>

    engage fully with these issues and they were not fully argued before this
    court. The motion judge said, at para. 48:</span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, there is the disclosure of the [pre-disposition
    report] which [the appellant] alleges is in breach of the <i>Young Offenders
    Act</i> and the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>. There are two distinct
    reasons which lead me to dismiss this claim. First, to the extent [that] such
    disclosure <u>may have been in breach of legislation, it ought to have been
    pursued as an offence under that legislation</u>. Second, it <u>is not clear</u> that possession or disclosure of the [pre-disposition report], which was
    properly provided to [the Society] as [the appellant’s] parent between 1990 and
    1993, <u>is a breach of either the <i>Young Offenders Act</i>, which was in
    force at the time the report was prepared and obtained by [the Society], or the
    current <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i></u>. While there are detailed rules
    about youth court records, <u>the obligations do not clearly apply</u> where
    copies of a document, which also happen to be filed in youth court, are held by
    third parties. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the first reason for dismissing the claim, we do not accept that just
    because disclosure may constitute an offence under a legislative scheme, that
    this precludes pursuing the matter in an action. As for the second reason given
    for dismissing the claim, it revolves around a lack of clarity – “it is not
    clear” – as to the effect of the statute on the retention and disclosure of the
    subject material.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
