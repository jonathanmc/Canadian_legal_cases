  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant brought an action against the
    respondent for sexual battery and negligence. The trial judge held that the
    appellant failed to establish either claim on a balance of probabilities and
    dismissed the action in its entirety.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><b><span lang=EN-CA>The Evidence</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The events giving rise to this case occurred in
    2006. The appellant and the respondent were co-workers. They commenced a sexual
    relationship. The respondent was married at the time. He testified that he wanted
    to end the physical aspect of their relationship, and conveyed this to the
    appellant. They decided to have sex again for the last time. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified that the two went to a
    wooded area during a lunch break and had sexual intercourse. The respondent
    told her to turn onto her stomach. The appellant testified that she then felt
    excruciating pain; she almost passed out. The appellant thought that the
    respondent attempted to penetrate her anus with his penis, and with his fingers
    or hand. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and the respondent returned to
    work. The appellant testified that she asked the respondent, So, what made you
    think to do that? According to the appellant, the respondent said that it was
    something he wanted to try. By the time the two returned to work, the appellant
    noticed that she was bleeding quite badly.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant saw her family physician twice
    before mentioning and seeking treatment for anal pain two weeks after the anal
    sex allegedly occurred. A rectal fissure was observed and the appellant was eventually
    referred for specialized treatment. She received Botox treatment to help heal
    her fissure. She subsequently suffered incontinence that resulted in a
    temporary colostomy. The colostomy was eventually reversed, but the appellant
    was left with permanent weakening of her sphincter. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant relied on the evidence of two
    medical experts who opined that it would take a traumatic event to cause the
    appellants injury. Dr. Zane Cohen, a colorectal surgeon, testified that
    regular anal penetration would not be the cause. Possible causes would
    include: (a) rough sex involving larger objects being used during anal sex; (b)
    child birth; (c) car accident; or (d) impalement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent, who was self-represented at
    trial, agreed that he had sexual intercourse with the appellant. He also
    admitted that he penetrated the appellant from behind, but vaginally, not
    anally. The respondent testified that, when they were finished, he and the
    appellant returned to work. The appellant made no complaint of pain. Shortly
    after this event, the respondent was away on holiday. When he returned, the
    appellant seemed withdrawn. The respondent believed that the appellant was
    upset with him for ending the relationship. On one occasion, she alleged that
    he had penetrated her anally, which he denied. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination, the respondent was
    confronted with his Statement of Defence, which the lawyer he had retained at
    the early stages of the proceeding had filed on his behalf. In the Statement of
    Defence, it was admitted that the respondent digitally penetrated the
    appellants anus. The respondent denied that this was true. He had no
    explanation why it was included in his Statement of Defence. This was not the
    first time that the respondent disavowed these admissions in his pleading; he
    also testified that he did so during his examination for discovery, which took
    place roughly nine years before the trial. Asked why he did not amend his
    Statement of Defence, the respondent said he was not aware that he could.  </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><b><span lang=EN-CA>The Trial Judges Reasons</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge prepared detailed written
    reasons for judgment. He properly articulated the legal elements of sexual
    battery, relying on <em>PP v. DD</em>, 2017 ONCA 180, 137 O.R. (3d) 138. The
    trial judge was very focused on the standard of proof, which turned out to be
    determinative in this case. The trial judge quoted from <em>F.H. v. McDougall</em>,
    2008 SCC 53, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41, including para. 46, in which Rothstein J.
    said: If a responsible judge finds for the plaintiff, it must be accepted that
    the evidence was sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent to that judge that
    the plaintiff satisfied the balance of probabilities test.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge acknowledged, at para. 44, There
    is no doubt that if I accept the Plaintiffs evidence regarding the events, she
    would have established the tort of sexual battery. The trial judge also said,
    at para. 46, that even if it was not proved that the respondent caused the
    appellants sphincter injury, he would still be liable for sexual battery if he
    touched her without her consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge engaged in a careful assessment
    of the credibility of the appellant and the respondent. He identified a number
    of deficiencies in the appellants evidence, noting that she gave differing
    accounts of the incident to different people, which were contradicted by her
    testimony at trial, and that she saw her family doctor on two occasions over
    the course of two weeks before mentioning her injury. The trial judge
    contrasted the appellants evidence with the respondents account, which he
    characterized as straightforward, and only partially undermined by his
    cross-examination on the Statement of Defence. In the end, the trial judge
    found, at para. 52: I am not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that [the
    respondent] penetrated [the appellant] anally or touched her in any way without
    her consent.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><b><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge made
    a number of errors in his analysis. We are not persuaded by these submissions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in not giving effect to the respondents admissions in his Statement of
    Defence. We disagree. The trial judge was alive to this legal issue. It is
    clear that he treated the respondents trial evidence as an attempt to withdraw
    his earlier admission. It was within the discretion of the trial judge to grant
    leave to withdraw the admission as the appellant was not prejudiced by this
    turn of events, having had plenty of advanced notice of this shift, at least as
    far back as the respondents discovery almost nine years before the trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    by failing to deal separately with the evidence as it related to negligence,
    focusing all of his attention on battery. We disagree. The trial judge observed
    that both alleged causes of action were intertwined factually. At para. 40 he
    said, In either case, the Plaintiff argues that the legal result would be the
    same. Critical to both torts was whether the respondent touched the appellants
    anal area (with his hands and/or penis) without her consent. The failure to
    prove this fact was fatal to the entire action. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, the appellant challenges the manner in
    which the trial judge evaluated the evidence, arguing that he confounded the
    issues of liability and causation of the appellants injuries. Again, we
    disagree. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As discussed above, the trial judge carefully
    evaluated all of the evidence. He was simply not satisfied that the standard of
    proof had been met. He identified problems with the appellants evidence and
    noted that it was roundly contradicted by the respondents account. While the
    trial judges finding, at para. 48, that the appellant did not know what
    happened during the alleged sexual battery may be at odds with a brief portion
    of her testimony in which she described the incident, this finding was one of
    many factors he considered in his credibility assessment of the appellant. His
    credibility findings are entitled to deference on appeal: <em>Housen v.
    Nikolaisen</em>, 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at para. 24. We are not
    satisfied that there is any reason to disturb them. </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><b><span lang=EN-CA>Disposition</span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is dismissed. We make no order as to
    costs.</span></p>
