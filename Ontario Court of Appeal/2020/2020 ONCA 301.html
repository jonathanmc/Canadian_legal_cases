  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The main issue raised on this appeal is the
    admissibility of evidence obtained from a search of a residence executed under
    an invalid search warrant. The search resulted in the seizure of three
    computers containing child pornography. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the Crown conceded that the warrant to
    search the residence was invalid. Accordingly, the search constituted a breach
    of the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the <em>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>,
    which protects against unreasonable search or seizure. However, after
    undertaking the requisite analysis under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>, the
    trial judge determined that the evidence ought not to be excluded. The trial
    judge was satisfied that the admission of the evidence would not bring the
    administration of justice into disrepute. The appellant was subsequently
    convicted of possession of child pornography and accessing child pornography,
    with the latter conviction stayed pursuant to the principle in <em>Kienapple v.
    R.</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. He was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 18
    months’ probation, along with various ancillary orders.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals against conviction on the
    basis that the trial judge made a number of errors in the s. 24(2) analysis. He
    also appeals a 10-year prohibition order pursuant to s. 161 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons set out below, the appeals are
    dismissed.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Detective Abrams of the Hamilton Police received
    a report from the Catholic Children’s Aid Society on February 22, 2010. It
    documented an allegation made by L.W., the appellant’s six-year-old daughter, to
    her mother, Y.Z., about the appellant washing L.W.’s “bum” and “private parts”
    with his bare hand. The CCAS and the Hamilton Police started a joint
    investigation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Detective Abrams received a memorandum from a
    CCAS caseworker, and subsequently spoke with the caseworker by telephone. She also
    interviewed the complainant and her mother. L.W. told Detective Abrams that the
    appellant had been placing his finger in her anus and that he sometimes put it
    up “higher” than other times. She said that it hurt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Y.Z. informed Detective Abrams that in March of
    2006 she had discovered that the appellant had been viewing child pornography
    on his computer. At some point thereafter, the appellant and Y.Z. separated. In
    June of 2006, the appellant voluntarily sought treatment at the Clarke
    Institute with respect to his use of child pornography, and a doctor from the
    Clarke Institute contacted the CCAS on June 13, 2006 to express concerns about
    the appellant’s sexual interest in girls under the age of 16 years. Thereafter,
    Detective Abrams was told, the appellant’s access to L.W. and her brother took
    place under the supervision of the CCAS. Later, that condition was withdrawn
    and the appellant was able to have unsupervised access to his children.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant and her brother told the police
    that the only things present in their father’s home were a bed, a computer
    chair, and three computers. From time to time, the complainant was alone with
    the appellant at his home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was arrested on March 4, 2010 for sexual
    assault. Detective Abrams swore an information to obtain a warrant authorizing
    a search of the appellant’s residence, and in particular, a search of his
    electronic devices for child pornography. The Information to Obtain set out
    that these searches “will afford evidence with respect to the commission of”
    offences involving the sexual assault and sexual touching of L.W. Detective
    Abrams deposed that “[t]hese items will assist in the sexual assault investigation
    where [L.W.] is a victim.” She also deposed that the items would “also possibly
    afford evidence of the commission of the offence of child pornography.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The search warrant was granted. The appellant’s
    residence was searched and three computers were seized. Pornographic images of
    children were discovered on one or more computers. The police found no
    pornographic images of L.W. or depictions of sexual assault against L.W.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, counsel for the appellant challenged
    the search warrant on the basis that the affiant, Detective Abrams, had misled
    the issuing justice. The appellant was granted leave to cross-examine the
    affiant. The cross-examination was limited to two areas: (1) what records from
    the CCAS were in the possession of the affiant when the ITO was sworn, and (2)
    the affiant’s belief that a search of the appellant’s computers would yield
    evidence of a sexual assault on L.W.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The affiant agreed that she was only
    investigating allegations related to sexual touching at that time, and not
    child pornography. This is clear from the ITO, where the alleged sexual
    offences against L.W. were the only ones listed as being under active
    investigation. The ITO was also clear that the affiant believed on reasonable
    grounds that the search would afford evidence with respect to those offences. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Detective Abrams testified on the <em>voir dire </em>that
    her investigative objective was to find evidence that would corroborate the
    young complainant’s account. The following exchanges demonstrate this
    objective: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.
         I’m going to suggest to you, Officer, that what you were hoping by
    drafting this ITO is that you would find child pornography on the computers,
    correct? </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.
         Part of that is correct, yes. I was hoping I would find pornography of his
    daughter to corroborate her statement is what I was hoping for.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Q.
         […] In your mind, the link between the allegations regarding [L.W.] and
    the offences that you thought the computers would afford evidence in relation
    to, that was you might find child pornography in relation to [L.W.], of his
    daughter? </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.
         Of evidence in relation to a sexual assault against his daughter, yes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the affiant acknowledged that she had
    not articulated in the ITO her rationale for believing that the appellant’s

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>A.
         I wouldn’t say I hoped that there would be a victim, no. What I would say
    is that I was looking for evidence that would corroborate his daughter’s
    allegations of a sexual assault against her, and that was based on previous
    experience, based on training that I had taken, that there would be child
    pornography on computers that somebody with a history of child pornography had. </span></p>

    evidence from the computers she expected to find, the officer answered, “Pornographic
    pictures of the victim.” When asked why, she answered: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Because it was a sex – the allegations were
    sexual in nature. The victim was under the age of 16 or… and his history with
    the child pornography, the information that was given to me about his
    preference, his sexual preference, as well as cases that I had previously
    worked on involving sexual assault victims and child pornography and courses
    that I had attended to prior to March of 2010. </span></p>

    the appellant took photographs of his young children that had been posted on
    Facebook, and that he spent time alone with his six-year-old daughter at his
    apartment that contained the computers. She also expressed the view that any
    child pornography contained on the appellant’s computers could “corroborate his
    sexual interest in children.” </span></p>

    grounds in the ITO. The Crown characterized the nature of the s. 8 breach as
    technical: a failure to articulate all the reasons underlying her genuine
    belief that a search would yield evidence with respect to the commission of sexual
    assault on L.W. </span></p>

    negligence as equivalent to good faith, contrary to <em>R. v. Le</em>, 2019 SCC
    34, 375 C.C.C. (3d) 431, at para. 143. He argues that the affiant was

lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We do not agree. What matters at this stage of
    the analysis is that the trial judge appropriately judged the nature of the
    conduct in question. As Doherty J.A. explained in <em>R. v. Kitaitchik</em> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 14 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 41, “[p]olice conduct can run
    the gamut from blameless conduct, through negligent conduct, to conduct
    demonstrating a blatant disregard for <em>Charter </em>rights […] What is
    important is the proper placement of the police conduct along that fault line,
    not the legal label attached to the conduct.” In any event, the trial judge did
    not excuse the affiant’s poor drafting on the basis that she wrote the ITO in good
    faith. He was aware that the affiant’s drafting fell short of what was needed by
    the issuing justice; he was critical of it, finding that it amounted to “[n]egligence
    perhaps”. But he rejected the submission that the affiant fabricated her
    evidence in cross-examination, and he accepted her testimony that she believed
    the searches of the appellant’s computers could further her investigation of
    L.W.’s complaints. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    leaving out some propositions that explained why the affiant concluded there
    were reasonable grounds to believe there could be child pornography on one or
    more of the computers in the appellant’s apartment, and why, in these
    particular circumstances the presence of child pornography on the computers
    would further the investigation into the alleged sexual assault of the

    accept that the authorization to search the appellant’s computers was nothing
    more than a fishing expedition. Although he had sought treatment, the appellant
    had a known previous predilection for child pornography relating to females
    under 16 years of age. While his treatment at the Clarke Institute had ended,
    the appellant had been transferred to a counsellor in the community and, as the
    affiant said in the ITO, “[t]he name of that counsellor and the status of that
    treatment is unknown at this time.” </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the appellant had been previously
    barred from seeing the complainant other than in the presence of another adult because
    a physician from the Clarke Institute had told the CCAS that there was a
    concern with the appellant’s “sexual interest in girls under the age of 16
    years” and that he “posed a risk to young girls in that age group.” There were
    three computers in the apartment. He was alone in that apartment with the young
    complainant from time to time. She alleged that at least some of the sexual
    assaults took place at that location. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the unusual circumstances of this case, it
    was open to the police to seek prior authorization to search the computers for
    the very reasons articulated by the affiant on the <em>voir dire</em>.<em> </em>The
    appellant had an established problem relating to child pornography; the appellant
    had previously received limited access to the young child because of those
    difficulties for which he had sought treatment; the child was alleging that she
    had been sexually assaulted by the appellant while alone in his apartment; and
    the alleged conduct was in proximity to the computers to be searched. In these
    circumstances, although she failed to articulate her reasoning, the affiant had
    reasonable grounds to believe that there would be evidence of child pornography
    on the computers and that this evidence would be rationally connected to the
    investigation into the alleged conduct relating to L.W. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Clearly, any child pornography images of the
    young child would provide evidence of the alleged offences. Moreover, the
    affiant believed that the presence of any child pornography on the appellant’s
    computers would assist the police in assessing the plausibility of the
    complainant’s account because it would go some distance towards establishing
    the appellant’s continued sexual interest in young girls. Although that
    evidence may not have been admissible at trial, search warrants are not
    designed to obtain only admissible evidence. The affiant was concerned with
    ensuring the veracity of the complainant’s account. She determined that the
    presence of child pornography on the appellant’s computer could assist in satisfying
    herself of the child’s version of events. Again, in the unusual circumstances
    of this case, that rationale is sustainable.</span></p>
