    Antonio Skarica of the Superior Court of Justice, dated September 27, 2019,
    with reasons reported at 2019 ONSC 3623.</span></p>
  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Lauwers J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stonebrook hired the appellant, Darlene Welton, as Vice President of
    Marketing and Sales. A dispute arose concerning her compensation for sales for
    additional services she provided. She appeals the trial judge’s award of
    compensation to her on the basis that it was inadequate on the facts and the
    law. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals on the merits.</p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The factual context</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>David and John Welton were brothers and had
    worked together for decades. They incorporated Stonebrook Properties Inc. in
    2004 as a joint venture to build a condominium development in Mississauga. Each
    of their respective companies, Davwel Investments Inc. and Johwel Investments
    Inc., held a 50% share in Stonebrook. The brothers fell out over this
    development and, it appears, over the appellant’s role and compensation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Stonebrook development comprised two high-rise
    condominium buildings, with Phase I having 226 units and Phase II having 225 units.
    Phase I sales launched in 2006 and the building was substantially completed in
    2010. Phase II sales launched in 2010, but the building was cancelled in May
    2012, as the result of low sales.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the late 1990s, the appellant was a marketing
    and sales director at Hunter Milborne, a brokerage firm retained by developers
    to sell pre-construction condominium units, earning about $150,000 annually. She
    met David Welton in 2003-2004 when the Welton brothers retained Milborne to
    replace another brokerage on their Oakridge Heights condominium development,
    which was an earlier project. The appellant married David Welton about one year
    later.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 2005, Stonebrook hired the appellant as Vice
    President of Marketing and Sales. Her employment was terminated at the end of
    2012. During her tenure, the appellant received bi-weekly advances and some
    additional payments toward the ultimate remuneration owing to her. The trial
    judge accepted that Stonebrook paid her a total of $744,277.23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 6, 2012, John Welton advised the
    appellant that her position would be terminated once the last units in Phase I
    were sold or transferred, which occurred in December 2012. The trial judge
    found that she received her last pay cheque at the end of December 2012, and,
    as of January 1, 2013, she was no longer employed by Stonebrook.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case turned on the fact that the terms of
    the appellant’s employment were never formalized. The appellant brought two
    actions for compensation. She issued the 2012 Statement of Claim on October 25,
    2012, while still employed by Stonebrook, claiming unpaid sales commissions of
    about $1.35 million. In the 2015 action, the appellant claimed compensation in
    the amount of $440,000 related to the Tarion Warranty claim, particularly her
    “Technical Audit work for Phase I from 2011 to 2013, including her settlement
    negotiations with its Condominium Corporation for outstanding deficiencies.”</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>ISSUES</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal raises four issues concerning the
    appellant’s compensation: The rate of commission the appellant was to receive for
    the Phase I sales; the rate of commission for the Phase II sales; compensation
    for her construction services work; and compensation for her work on the Tarion
    Warranty claim against Stonebrook. The fifth issue concerns the costs award
    made at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I address each issue in turn.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></h1>

    Phase I and Phase II Sales</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is convenient to deal with the first two
    issues together.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellant’s Claim</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As the appellant describes it, in the 2012
    action, she “claimed commissions equaling the greater of 2% of sales revenue
    net of taxes for Phases I and II, or $220,000 per annum.” By her calculation,
    as submitted to the trial judge, 2% totalled $1,330,997.22 for Phase I and
    $744,898.76 for Phase II. She advanced an alternative claim for $220,000 per
    year for seven years and four months, which amounted to $1,613,333.33.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading7><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Trial Judge’s Award</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge assessed the 2012 action in two
    parts corresponding to the development’s two phases. He set “a fair rate of
    remuneration” for Stonebrook Phase I at “1.5% of net sales, net of HST/GST and
    insider sales”: at para. 510. The trial judge deducted from this amount “payments
    to sales agents and sales personnel per the industry standard practice” and
    draws paid to the appellant: at para. 510. The appellant’s factum provides
    details of the trial judge’s calculations:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge calculated the amount owing to
    [the appellant] for Phase I as 1.5% of $67,635,404.30 which totaled
    $1,014,531.06. He then deducted the amounts paid to sales staff of $261,268 and
    the $744,277.23 in advances already paid to [the appellant] to arrive at
    $8,985.83. The trial judge calculated the amount owing to [the appellant] for
    Phase II as 1.5% of $37,244,938.20 which totaled $558,674.07. He then implied a
    further term to reduce this amount to one-third and deducted amounts paid to
    sales staff and amounts paid to [the appellant] of $6,800 and $6,257.71, respectively,
    to arrive at $173,166.98.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For Phase II, the trial judge found that “pursuant
    to the usual practice …, [the appellant] would be entitled to 1/3 of her
    commissions based on the same commission rate of 1.5% of net sales net of
    HST/GST as the project was cancelled before construction commenced”: at para.
    511.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the result, the trial judge awarded the
    appellant the following commissions, at para. 517:</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argued at trial that the agreed
    remuneration was the greater of $220,000 per annum or 2% commission on sales
    revenue net of taxes. </span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>The
    trial judge traced the $220,000 per annum figure to a letter dated June 18,
    2012 and signed by the appellant’s husband David Welton. He noted: “Crucially,
    this Tab 138 letter, dated June 18, 2012, signed by David and addressed to
    Darlene Welton ‘confirm the verbal [agreement] between you and I’ </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>i.e. </span></em><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:100%'>David and
    Darlene”: at para. 450.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the appellant’s
    evidence for two reasons. First, he relied on the evidence of Stonebrook’s chief
    financial officer. Second, he invoked the appellant’s own evidence, at paras.
    451-452:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Tab 138 letter also indicates the agreed
    upon remuneration is 2% of sales revenue or $220,000 per annum, whichever is
    greater. Sidney Dick, Stonebrook’s chief financial officer, was shocked to see
    this $220,000 per annum claim. Accordingly, it can be concluded that Sidney
    Dick, a key financial officer, was never advised of an agreement of a minimum
    $220,000 per annum payment to Darlene. Sidney Dick testified that the
    subsequent Exhibit 1, Volume 3, Tab 148 demand letter from Darlene’s lawyer
    asking for $220,000 came ‘out of the blue,’ (the Tab 148 letter was dated July
    16, 2012).</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In cross-examination, Darlene conceded that
    this reference to $220,000 per annum payment never appears in the documentary
    record prior to June 18, 2012.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Credibility was at issue in this case. The trial
    judge identified ten material inconsistencies and contradictions in the
    appellant’s evidence, which led him to reject her evidence as being “neither
    credible nor reliable”: at para. 414. He found that the appellant failed to
    prove there was an agreement to pay her a 2% commission of sales revenue net of
    taxes or $220,000 per annum, whichever was greater, at paras. 413-414, 458:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Darlene’s evidence presented numerous
    inconsistencies. Further, as outlined above, she was also contradicted by her
    discovery evidence, filed exhibits, undertaking answers, and the evidence of
    other witnesses.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, I find that Darlene’s testimony
    was neither credible nor reliable. I reject her evidence, particularly her
    evidence regarding the alleged three-way agreement in 2006. I reject her
    evidence that John agreed to pay a 2% commission and/or $220,000 per year.</span></p>

    that he assumed that the sales commission rate would be the same rate as that
    of prior sales consultants – 1.5% – based on instructions received after a
    private meeting between the Welton brothers. Regarding this evidence, the trial
    judge noted, at para. 456:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Dick testified that three months before
    the first cheque to Darlene in May 2006, John, after a closed door meeting with
    David, told Mr. Dick that Darlene’s sales commission would be the same sales
    commission rate as prior sales consultants. Mr. Dick assumed it would be 1.5%.</span></p>

    further discussions apart from “an understanding in accordance with Welton

    accordance with industry standards and the brothers’ past practices regarding
    commission rates”: at para. 490.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge determined that he should apply the
    principles of <em>quantum meruit </em>to determine the appropriate amount of
    remuneration in the absence of a formal written agreement: at para. 494. He found
    that the appellant had established a <em>quantum meruit </em>claim because she
    provided services at Stonebrook’s request “in circumstances that render[ed] it
    unjust for [Stonebrook] to retain the benefit conferred by the provision of the
    services”: at para. 192. As the trial judge found, John and David hired the
    appellant to be the Vice President of Marketing and Sales and, based on the
    documentary record, “it would be unjust for Darlene not to receive a fair
    commission for her services”: at para. 494.</span></p>

    argued that the trial judge had not properly valued her services. The appellant
    asserted in her factum:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In light of all of the circumstances, $220,000
    per year is a fair and reasonable valuation of Mrs. Welton's services to
    Stonebrook, and what Stonebrook could reasonably expect to pay someone else to
    perform those services. For the period between 2006 through 2013, Stonebrook
    should pay Mrs. Welton $1,760,000 less advances already paid of $744,277.23.
    This results in a damages award of $1,015,722.77.</span></p>

    the expert evidence adduced by both parties that there is no industry
    standard.”</span></p>

    commission rates vary widely between 1% and 2%. Likewise, the respondents’

    several attached agreements that set commission rates at between 1.25% and

    commission rate, within the experience and expectations of the [parties], and
    in conformity with industry standards”: at para. 505. The trial judge also noted
    that 1.5% was “midway between the 1% and 2% typical commission ranges as
    indicated at p. 3 of the plaintiff’s Exhibit 8 expert report”: at para. 505. He
    repeated this conclusion, at para. 510, before carrying out the calculation,

    this evidence appears to conflict with an e-mail she sent to the company
    bookkeeper, Dolores Gosine, on August 3, 2011. In that e-mail, the appellant
    explains that Ms. Gosine had “deducted salaries paid for <u>both</u> phases”
    (emphasis in original). She asked Ms. Gosine to </span><span lang=EN-CA
style='line-height:100%'>“recalculate the salaries paid for Stonebrook Phase I
    only” and to “remove any salaries paid to the others” with the exception of the
    sales staff, receptionists, sales office part-time help, and opening event
    help. She then stated that “all salaries paid, including my commission advances
    since June 4, 2010 [the date on which Phase II began], are to be applied
    against commissions earned for Phase II.” When pressed on cross-examination,
    she agreed she could have been clearer in the e-mail and simply informed Ms.
    Gosine that none of those salaries were to be deducted from her commission, if
    the sales staff’s salaries were irrelevant. The appellant then said she did not
    recall the e-mail at all or why she wrote it that way and what she was
    addressing in the e-mail.</span></p>

    insufficient sales to obtain the necessary construction loans John Welton
    decided that the project was no longer viable and would lose money. He
    cancelled Phase II in May 2012. The appellant claimed full commissions for the
    units sold in Phase II even though it was cancelled.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    provided by the experts and noted that the industry standard was to provide for
    cancellation, with payment of 1/3 of the commission for units on which the

    commissions based on a rate of 1.5% of net sales, net of HST/GST.</span></p>

    Marketing and Sales. Stonebrook’s expert did not provide evidence on this
    point.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that she should receive

    and Sales, and $249,800 per year from 2010 through to the end of 2013 when she
    also performed additional construction services previously performed by Colin
    Pillar. Accordingly, she values this work at about $100,000 per year from 2010
    to the end of 2013 based on the calculated differential between her salary and
    that of the Vice President of Development and Construction, Mr. Pillar, who was
    relieved of that work on the Stonebrook development. She argues that had she
    been unable to perform his duties, Stonebrook “would have had to employ someone
    else to oversee the project.” She asserts that the trial judge should have
    determined “what Stonebrook would have to pay someone to perform those

    leveraged its “full time sales and marketing employee who could devote more
    time and effort than a broker could provide” with respect to “the Tarion
    process and construction issues (areas not normally done by brokers)”: at para.
    496. The trial judge found that the appellant anticipated commission in excess
    of her former base salary but was not exposed to the risks brokers commonly
    bear – “[she] had no overhead and did not have to pay sales agents personally.
    Basically, her commission pay was being in part subsidized by Stonebrook for

    and fix her trial costs at $41,000, which is about the amount he awarded the
    respondents. This amount reflects “a fair and reasonable” costs award in the
    circumstances; the court need not fix costs according to the “exact measure of
    the actual costs to the successful litigant” (internal citations omitted): <em>Boucher</em>,
    at para. 24. In total, the appellant is entitled to $74,000 in costs for the
    2012 action.</span></p>

    would grant leave to appeal the trial costs award. I would allow the appellant’s
    costs appeal from the 2012 action and grant trial costs to her in the amount of
    $74,000. Because the respondents were otherwise successful on appeal, they are
    entitled to costs for the appeal in the amount of $25,000, which I would reduce
    to $20,000 in view of the appellant’s success on the costs appeal. The
    respondents’ costs will be offset against the appellant’s costs award in the
    2012 action.</span></p>

    of the reasons for decision in this case, which is reflective of an
    unfortunately growing trend, of which this is not the worst example, but it is
    the one before us.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Trial judges attend to the evidence in light of
    the relevant law, listen to it and think about it, draw appropriate inferences,
    distill the key evidence, make the factual findings, apply the law to the
    findings, and communicate the basis for the decision to the parties through the
    reasons. Of these various tasks, simply being present to receive the evidence
    is only a trial judge’s first step on the path to the decision.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>More specifically, in their reasons trial judges
    identify the key issues; find the facts relevant to the issues; assess
    credibility and reliability where there is conflict; set out the chain of
    reasoning; make the decision; and then write the reasons to clearly communicate
    the decision. All of this is necessary for the reasons to be of acceptable
    quality and for there to be a meaningful right of appeal. (All of these
    elements are present in the reasons in this case but are somewhat hard to
    discern in the expanded text.)</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Note that in setting out these essential tasks I
    have reversed the customary sequence in decisions, in which the recitation of
    facts precedes the statement of the issues. The problem I wish to highlight
    occurs precisely there. It makes good narrative sense to inform the reader by setting
    the context first, which involves telling the underlying story briefly. But the
    real marshalling of the facts according to their relevance and salience is only
    possible when the trial judge has identified the live issues. In short, factual
    determinations and descriptions should be issue-driven.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is important for trial judges to focus the
    analysis on the live issues that will decide the case. Helpful guidance can be
    found in the somewhat analogous function that trial judges perform in crafting
    criminal and civil jury instructions: “The obligation to review the substantial
    parts of the evidence and relate it to the issues that ripen for decision by
    the jury imposes no duty upon the trial judge to review <em>all</em> the
    evidence. <span style='color:black'>The role of the trial judge is to decant
    and simplify” (internal citations omitted)</span>: <em>R. v. Saleh</em>, 2013
    ONCA 742, at para. 142, <em>per</em> Watt J.A. There is, to emphasize, no need
    to recite all of the evidence, even the irrelevant, or to refer to every
    argument made by every party, no matter how unhelpful: <em>R. v. R.E.M.</em>,
    2008 SCC 51, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 3 at paras. 11-12, 35-57; <em>Canada (Minister of
    Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov</em>, 2019 SCC 65, at para. 128.</span></p>

    not address the evidence and the arguments and are criticized as conclusory, on
    the one hand, and decisions that leave nothing out, on the other hand. The task
    of a trial judge is to find the golden mean, to “decant and simplify,” to
    synthesize the evidence and make the necessary findings; the task is not to be
    a court reporter.</span></p>

    contain what I would call a “factual data dump.” Pages 5-79 consist of a
    witness-by-witness account of examination in-chief, cross-examination, and
    re-examination. The analysis of the evidence starts at para. 394 on p. 79 and
    it repeats some of the evidence previously reviewed, adding to the length.</span></p>

    electronic note-taking by judges, but it is not helpful and can be confusing. A
    blizzard of words can obscure. Digesting unduly lengthy reasons consumes far
    too much time because every word must be read by the parties, by their counsel
    at great expense, and by appellate courts. A data dump does not constitute fact-finding.
    It is an extended ‘note to self’ best kept to oneself because it hinders the
    efficient and economical communication of judicial reasoning.</span></p>
