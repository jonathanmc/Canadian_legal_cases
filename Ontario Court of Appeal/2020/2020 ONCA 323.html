  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the late evening or early morning of April 28<sup>th</sup>/29<sup>th</sup>,
    2017, someone broke into the Anthony home in Orillia, Ontario and stole Ms.
    Anthony’s purse and the keys to the truck parked in the driveway. The next
    morning, Mr. Anthony discovered the purse, keys and truck were missing. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and a co-accused were charged with
    one count of break and enter, two counts of theft (the truck and the purse),
    and one count of possession of stolen property (the truck). The co-accused was
    acquitted on all counts. The appellant was convicted on counts one to three and
    acquitted on count four, based on the date of the offence alleged in the
    information. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant initially appealed conviction and
    sentence, but has abandoned his sentence appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The case against the appellant was entirely
    circumstantial. The Crown argued that the totality of the circumstantial
    evidence compelled the conclusion that the appellant, with one or more
    accomplices, had broken into the Anthony home, stole the purse and keys and
    drove the Anthony car to Kingston to visit his girlfriend.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not testify. The Crown tendered
    a statement made by the appellant. In that statement, he acknowledged getting a
    ride from Orillia to Hamilton and then to Kingston to see his girlfriend. He
    would not identify the driver.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was little, if any, dispute about the
    credibility of the evidence tendered by the Crown. The outcome turned on what
    inferences could be drawn from that evidence. The evidence justified the
    following findings:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    the Anthony home in Orillia, Ontario and stole Ms. Anthony’s purse and the keys
    to the truck parked in the driveway. The thieves left the house and drove away
    in the truck;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the appellant was living in a drug
    rehabilitation residence in Orillia on April 28<sup>th</sup>. He was required
    to sign in and out. He signed out of the residence shortly after 6:00 p.m. on
    April 28<sup>th</sup> and did not return;</span></p>

    locations of the rehabilitation residence and the Anthony home, other than both
    were said to be in Orillia;</span></p>

    Kingston on May 19<sup>th</sup>. Parking tickets on the truck indicated it had
    been parked on the same street, if not in the same spot, since at least May 3<sup>rd</sup> at 9:52 a.m.; </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    residence where the co-accused was arrested;</span></p>

    can found under the passenger seat in the Anthony’s vehicle. The co-accused’s
    DNA was found on a cup also located in the back of the vehicle. Other cups and

    did not belong to Mr. Anthony. The appellant had a construction job on April 28<sup>th</sup> when he left the Orillia area. There was no physical evidence connecting the

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In convicting the appellant on three charges,
    the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I find nothing in the evidence or in common
    sense which proffers any reasonable, innocent explanation for their
    juxtaposition. Mr. Phillips had a motive to go to Kingston. He had no vehicle of
    his own. He was right in the area of where the vehicle was stolen. The vehicle
    took a path to Kingston shortly after it was stolen. He was arrested in
    Kingston at his girlfriend’s house, some 300 plus kilometres away within 2½
    days, and his DNA was found inside the vehicle. Obviously it had been put there
    before May 1st, because after May 1st noon, he was in custody.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, it would require a great deal of
    speculation to come up with some alternative explanation that fits common sense
    and reality on the evidence that is before me.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that the verdict is
    unreasonable. He submits, that while the circumstances are suspicious, the
    inferences necessary to prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt cannot
    reasonably be drawn. In his submission, at its highest, the evidence puts the
    appellant in the Anthony vehicle some time after it was stolen on the evening
    or early morning of April 28<sup>th</sup>-29<sup>th</sup> and the time of his
    arrest on May 1<sup>st</sup> at around noon. The appellant contends the finding
    he was in the truck within a few days of its theft could not support the
    conclusion that he was ever in possession of the truck, much less that he was a
    party to the break-in and thefts at the Anthony home. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court has a limited power under s.
    686(1)(a)(i) to review the reasonableness of a conviction. This court’s task is
    well described in <em>R. v. Lights</em>, 2020 ONCA 128, at para. 39:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When a verdict that rests wholly or
    substantially on circumstantial evidence is challenged as unreasonable, the
    question appellate courts must ask is whether the trier of fact, acting
    judicially, could reasonably be satisfied that the guilt of the accused was the
    only reasonable conclusion available on the evidence taken as a whole:
    [citation omitted]. Fundamentally, it is for the trier of fact to determine
    whether any proposed alternative way of looking at the case as a whole is
    reasonable enough to raise a doubt about the guilt of the accused.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is nothing to connect the appellant to the
    break-in or the thefts, except for his alleged possession of the stolen vehicle
    shortly after the break-in and thefts occurred. The reasonableness of the three
    convictions turns on whether the circumstantial evidence was reasonably capable
    of supporting the inference the appellant was not only in the Anthony vehicle
    when it travelled to Kingston, but was also in possession of that vehicle.
    Possession requires proof of some element of control over the thing said to be
    possessed: <em>R. v. Pham</em> (2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 326, at para. </span><span
lang=FR-CA>16 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 940; <em>R. v. Terrence</em>,
    [1983] 1 S.C.R. 357. </span><span lang=EN-CA>Absent a finding the appellant was
    in possession of the truck, the further inferences he was the person who broke
    into the Anthony home and stole the purse and keys was not reasonably
    available.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown claims there were two or more people
    involved in the break-in, the theft and the trip to Kingston. There is no
    evidence the appellant was driving the vehicle. Other than evidence he was in
    the vehicle, there is nothing from which possession of the vehicle could
    reasonably be inferred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We are satisfied the evidence was equally
    consistent with an inference that the appellant became involved with the
    vehicle some time after the break-in and the thefts had occurred. On that view,
    even if the appellant knew the break-in had occurred and the vehicle was
    stolen, he was not a party to the break-in or the thefts from the Anthony
    residence. His potential liability on a charge of possession of the stolen
    vehicle, based on his presence in the vehicle, is a  moot point. He was
    acquitted on that charge and there is no appeal from that acquittal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On our review of the evidence, a trier of fact
    could not reasonably be satisfied that the appellant’s guilt on the charges was
    the only reasonable conclusion available on the evidence. The appeal must be
    allowed, the verdicts set aside, and acquittals entered.</span></p>
