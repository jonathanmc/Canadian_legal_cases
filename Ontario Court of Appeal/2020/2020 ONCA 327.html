  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was convicted of two counts of
    sexual assault. The offences occurred in 1996 and 1997, but were not reported
    until years later. The appellant was charged in 2016, convicted in August 2017,
    and sentenced to 14 months in November 2017. He appeals conviction and sentence.
    The appellant has been on bail pending appeal for 2½ years. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, the appeals are
    dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The two complainants, J.P. and C.P., are
    cousins. In 1996 and 1997, J.P. and her mother shared a duplex with J.P.’s
    grandmother. J.P. and her mother lived on one side and her grandmother lived on
    the other side. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>C.P. often came to visit her grandmother and
    played with J.P. They moved back and forth between the two parts of the duplex.
    At the relevant time, J.P. was five or six and C.P. was between eight and ten.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.P.’s mother was involved in a relationship
    with the appellant. He was often at the duplex. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.P. and C.P. both described being sexually
    assaulted by the appellant on two occasions. All four occasions occurred at the
    duplex when the complainants were very young. All four incidents involved the
    appellant putting his hand under the complainants’ clothing, including their underpants.
    On at least three of the four occasions, he digitally penetrated the
    complainants’ vaginas. On three of the four occasions, the complainants were
    sitting on the appellant’s lap or knee.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>J.P.’s mother testified. She recalled an
    incident when she saw the appellant put his hands under J.P.’s covers and near
    her “private area”. She told the appellant to get away from her daughter. This
    incident was quite similar to one of the assaults described by J.P.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition to describing the two sexual
    assaults, J.P. also testified that the appellant photographed her and C.P. when
    they were in the bath together. J.P.’s mother confirmed that the appellant took
    a picture of J.P. alone when J.P. was in the shower. C.P. testified that she
    was not aware of any photos being taken of her when she was in the bath or
    shower.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant testified and denied the
    allegations. He indicated he had a brief relationship with J.P.’s mother in
    late 1996 and early 1997. He ended the relationship because of her “lifestyle”.
    J.P. and the appellant ended up in a custody dispute over their son. The
    appellant eventually got custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant admitted taking a photograph of
    J.P. when she was in the bathtub. He indicated that J.P.’s mother had asked him
    to take the photograph.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Several witnesses called by the defence gave
    what the trial judge properly characterized as character evidence for the
    appellant. They had little to say about the events giving rise to the charges.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Conviction Appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are two grounds of appeal:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial judge err in admitting the
    evidence directly relevant to one count as similar fact evidence on the other
    counts?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Did the trial judge apply different levels of
    scrutiny as between the complainants’ evidence and the appellant’s evidence?</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Similar Fact Evidence Ruling</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ruled the evidence directly
    relevant to each count was admissible on the other counts. He held the evidence
    was admissible to prove the <em>actus reus</em> of the allegations in each count.
    In so holding, the trial judge referred to the many similarities between the
    allegations of the two complainants, and the absence of any evidence of
    collusion. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant does not take issue with the trial
    judge’s determination the evidence on each count had probative value on the
    other counts. He submits, however, the trial judge failed to balance that
    probative value against the prejudicial effects of admitting the evidence across
    counts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave detailed reasons for
    admitting the evidence. He specifically identified the issue on which the
    evidence had probative value. The trial judge described, on at least two
    separate occasions, the nature of the potential prejudice inherent in the admission
    of similar fact evidence. He was obviously alive, both to the probative value
    of the evidence and the nature of the potential prejudice inherent in the
    evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This was a judge alone trial. There was no
    objection to the joinder on the same information of all four counts. It was
    understood the trial judge would hear the evidence on all counts. He
    specifically alerted himself to both the legitimate and the illegitimate
    purposes for which the evidence can be used. In deciding to admit the evidence,
    he was obviously satisfied the legitimate probative value of the evidence
    outweighed any risk of misusing the evidence. Indeed, it is difficult to see any
    risk that this trial judge would misuse the evidence after repeatedly and
    accurately identifying how the evidence could and could not be used.</span></p>

    against children, the outcome at trial turned, to a large extent, on the trial
    judge’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. The trial judge dealt
    at length with the credibility and reliability of the complainants’ testimony.
    He also addressed the appellant’s credibility. He did so in the context of the
    presumption of innocence and the burden on the Crown to prove its case beyond a
    reasonable doubt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ultimately rejected the
    appellant’s evidence as untrue. He believed the complainants’ evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s complaint that his evidence was
    subject to a more rigorous examination than the complainants’ evidence seems
    based in large measure on the different assessments ultimately made by the
    trial judge. Not surprisingly, the evidence of the complainants and the
    evidence of the appellant gave rise to very different credibility
    considerations. The trial judge concluded that the appellant’s veracity was
    tainted by his obvious animus towards J.P.’s mother. Nothing in the
    complainants’ evidence raised a comparable credibility related issue. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We see little value, for the purposes of
    appellate review, in comparing the trial judge’s assessment of the impact on
    the appellant’s credibility of his animus towards J.P.’s mother with the trial
    judge’s assessment of the impact on the complainants’ credibility of some
    entirely different feature of their evidence. A trial judge’s finding that
    factor “A” had a negative impact on the assessment of one witness’s
    credibility, but a completely different factor “B” did not have the same impact
    on the assessment of a different witness’s credibility is not uneven scrutiny. To
    the contrary, it reflects a proper individualized assessment of the different
    evidence offered by the different witnesses.</span></p>

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Sentence Appeal</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was sentenced to 14 months
    concurrent on the charges. The defence at trial sought a conditional sentence.
    They renew that request on appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A conditional sentence was legally available. It
    would, however, have been inappropriate. These were serious crimes committed
    against very young victims. The appellant took advantage of his access to the
    duplex through his friendship with J.P.’s mother to commit the crimes. The
    nature of the offences fully warranted a significant reformatory sentence. Nothing
    in the character or antecedents of the appellant supports the imposition of a
    non-custodial sentence. The sentence imposed was fit.</span></p>

    bail pending appeal was varied to allow him to surrender into custody, as
    directed by the court. As his appeals have been dismissed, he shall surrender
    into custody by no later than noon on Friday, May 29, 2020, failing which a
    warrant may issue for his arrest. </span></span></p>
