  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Hannora appeals the sentence imposed on him
    arising from his conviction on three counts after a trial with a jury. Mr.
    Hannora was sentenced to three years on a count of unauthorized possession of a
    restricted firearm, one year consecutive on a count of possession of a firearm
    while prohibited, and three years consecutive on a count of receive material
    benefit from sexual services, for a total sentence of seven years. Mr. Hannora
    abandoned his conviction appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The background facts can be stated briefly. The
    complainant was a sex trade worker who entered into a relationship with the
    appellant. The complainant continued to work in the sex trade while she was in
    this relationship with the appellant. The appellant received monies from the
    complainant which he used for his own personal expenses. The complainant also
    moved into a condominium that the appellant owned and paid rent to the
    appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On occasions during the relationship, the
    appellant was abusive towards the complainant. There were acts of physical
    violence. On one occasion, during an argument, the appellant produced a loaded
    handgun and threatened the complainant with it. It appears that the appellant
    had the handgun with him on other occasions, including when he went out in
    public. The complainant handled the handgun and, at one point, asked if she
    could shoot it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The relationship ended after a few months.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was 27 years old at the time of
    sentencing. He has a criminal record that includes convictions for theft under,
    mischief, break and enter, possession of a weapon and a number of breaches of
    court orders. It is of some importance that the longest sentence that the
    appellant had received, prior to these convictions, was for a total of 330 days,
    or slightly less than a year.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was a pre-sentence report before the
    sentencing judge that spoke positively about the appellant. As the sentencing
    judge observed, the appellant had accepted responsibility for his actions, and
    enjoyed strong family support. The sentencing judge also said, “Mr. Hannora has
    been described as a mature young man who had been making efforts to better
    himself, and who now needs to continue to learn from his mistakes.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In our view, the sentencing judge erred in his
    approach to the sentences he imposed by failing to properly apply the totality
    principle. The only mention of the totality principle made by the sentencing
    judge was with respect to the three year sentence he imposed on the firearms
    conviction, when he reduced what he considered to be an otherwise fit sentence
    on that count from 4 to 3 years.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The totality principle is properly applied to
    the total sentence imposed on an offender. Its purpose, where consecutive sentences
    are imposed, is to ensure that the total sentence is proportionate to the
    culpability of the offender. As Lamer C.J. said in <em>R. v. M. (C.A.)</em><i>,</i> [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p. 531:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The totality principle, in short, requires a
    sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for
    multiple offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not
    exceed the overall culpability of the offender.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> Having determined the fit disposition for each
    count, and running the sentences consecutive to one another, the trial judge
    was required to look at the total sentence of 7 years and ask whether it
    exceeded the overall culpability of the appellant. The failure to do so reflects
    an error in principle, one that impacted the sentence imposed: <em>Lacasse</em><i>, </i>at para. 44. Accordingly, it falls to this court to do so. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the circumstances of this case, having regard
    to the circumstances of the offending conduct, a total 7 year sentence for a 27
    year old offender who the trial judge accepted had positive prospects for
    rehabilitation, was genuinely remorseful, and whose previous longest sentence
    was less than a year, outstripped his overall culpability. On the
    rehabilitation aspect, we repeat the observation of Watt J.A. in <em>R. v.
    Angelis</em>, 2016 ONCA 675, 133 O.R. (3d) 575 (C.A.), where he said, at para.
    51:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Totality is a principle of sentence the
    purpose of which is to ensure that the total sentence imposed does not
    extinguish the rehabilitative potential of the offender.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>While we do not diminish the seriousness of the
    appellant’s conduct, the total sentence was excessive given the mitigating
    factors that we have mentioned. The principle of totality should be applied to
    reduce the overall length of time the appellant must serve in custody. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is recognized that one way to reconcile the
    overall sentence with the totality principle is to impose concurrent sentences,
    where otherwise the sentences would be consecutive: Clayton C. Ruby, et al., <em>Sentencing</em>,
    9th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2017), at </span><span lang=EN-CA>§</span><span
lang=EN-CA>2.75. This approach has been favoured by this court in a variety of
    decisions, including <em>R. v. Jewell</em><i> </i>(1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) (Ont.
    C.A.), where Finlayson J.A. said, at p. 279:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In performing this function, the trial judge
    will have to consider not only the appropriate sentence for each offence, but
    whether in light of totality concerns, a particular sentence should be
    consecutive or concurrent to the other sentences imposed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Taking into account the mitigating factors that
    we have mentioned above, the appropriate total sentence in this case would have
    been one of four years. That result can be accomplished by making the sentence
    on the receive material benefit count concurrent to the other two counts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We would grant leave to appeal sentence, allow
    the appeal, and make the sentence on count #3 concurrent to the sentences on
    counts #1 and #2. We would also set aside the victim fine surcharge.</span></p>
