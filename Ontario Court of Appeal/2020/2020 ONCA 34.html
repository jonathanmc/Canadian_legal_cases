  <p class=Onappealfrom>On appeal from the conviction entered on July 2, 2014 by
    Justice Peter A. Daley of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.H. and the complainant maintained a friendship after their live-in
    relationship ended in 2003. On November 1, 2008, the complainant attended the
    police station alleging that S.H. had sexually assaulted her after overpowering
    and choking her in her garage in the early morning hours. S.H. was ultimately
    charged with sexually assaulting the complainant and attempting to overcome
    resistance by choking her. He was also charged in connection with three other
    alleged, violent attacks on the complainant on other occasions: assault causing
    bodily harm in the early fall of 2003; assault with a weapon within an 18-month
    period ending on or about October 31, 2005; and another sexual assault in
    August of 2008. S.H. was convicted by a jury of both offences in connection
    with the November 1, 2008 incident. He was acquitted of the other charges. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.H. appeals the convictions. S.H. argues that the trial judge erred in:
    (1) his jury instruction on the use of cross-count evidence; (2) in his
    treatment of a prior consistent statement; (3) denying S.H.’s <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    s. 276 application to admit evidence of a prior sexual experience between S.H.
    and the complainant; and (4) failing to issue a corrective instruction in
    response to improper and inflammatory closing arguments from the Crown, which rendered
    the trial unfair.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown disputes grounds of appeal two to four, but concedes that the
    trial judge committed the first error in saying to the jury,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>if you conclude that the acts charged in one of the counts is
    or are similar to those charged in another, you may use the evidence on each
    count together with the rest of the evidence relating to that particular charge
    in reaching your verdict on any other charge.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown recognizes that: the trial Crown had not brought an application
    for cross-count admissibility; an admissibility application based on similarity
    could not have succeeded had it been brought; the trial judge failed to explain
    when evidence would be “similar”; and he gave no assistance to the jury on what
    permissible inferences they could draw. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argues, however, that these errors were not reversible errors
    since they are “harmless errors” occasioning no prejudice to S.H. within the
    meaning of s. 686(1)(b)(iii), therefore, permitting the application of the
    curative proviso. She contends that the jury would not have relied on the trial
    judge’s instructions because: the cross-count evidence was not similar; the
    jury acquitted S.H. of charges arising from the three alleged events prior to
    November 1, 2008; and the trial judge properly instructed the jury not to use
    propensity reasoning. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown concedes that if we disagree and find any of these errors to
    be serious, the convictions cannot be saved using the other leg of the s.
    686(1)(b)(iii) curative proviso – the overwhelming evidence leg. Specifically,
    the Crown concedes that it cannot be said in this jury trial, which revolved
    around credibility, that the evidence of the charges was so overwhelming that
    no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not find the errors to be harmless. There were similarities
    between other counts and the November 1, 2008 incident, including variously: S.H.’s
    consumption of alcohol before the alleged assaults; the rejection of S.H. by
    the complainant prior to the alleged assaults; head-butting; choking; and a
    subsequent apology. It is impossible to know what use the jury may have made of
    such similarities. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The direction not to draw prohibited inferences does not answer this
    concern since this direction addresses only moral prejudice arising from
    general bad character, not reasoning prejudice arising from illogical reasoning.
    Nor can the acquittals on other counts give comfort, as the rule barring the
    use of acquitted discreditable conduct as similar fact evidence does not apply
    in multi-count indictments. Moreover, the jury was not instructed against using
    evidence from counts they were acquitting on in deciding other counts: <em>R.
    v. Arp</em>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 79; <em>R. v. Mahalingan</em>, 2008
    SCC 63, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 316, at paras. 66-72. The Crown is therefore unable to
    satisfy us that these errors were harmless. They are reversible. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is enough to dispose of the appeal, but since reversible error has
    occurred and a new trial is required, it is prudent to give direction relating
    to other matters raised during the appeal. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the complainant’s prior consistent statements to her brother can
    be used for anything other than for the narrative purpose of explaining how the
    charges got before the court, the Crown should identify the inferences it seeks
    and obtain a ruling permitting such inferences. The trial judge should also direct
    the jury as to the limited use that may be made of the evidence and caution the
    jury against the prohibited uses of prior consistent statements: <em>R. v. D.C.</em>,
    2019 ONCA 442, at para. 21. In doing so, it is not enough to direct the jury
    not to use the prior consistent statements as hearsay. It is also impermissible
    to use consistency between testimony and prior statements as proof of the truthfulness
    of testimony, or to treat a prior consistent statement made by a witness as
    corroborating that witness: <em>D.C.</em>, at paras. 19, 22.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is inadmissible for a trial Crown, without proving affirmatively
    that a complainant did not have motive to mislead, to argue in substance that
    the absence of a known motive to mislead adds to the weight of her testimony:<em> R. v. Bartholomew</em>, 2019 ONCA 377, 375 C.C.C. (3d) 534, at paras. 22-23. Where
    this occurs, the trial judge must direct the jury that this reasoning is not
    permissible: <em>R. v. M.B</em>.<em>, </em>2011 ONCA 76, 267 C.C.C. (3d) 72, at
    paras. 30-32. Reasoning in this way undermines the presumption of innocence by
    reversing the burden of proof and fails to recognize that motives to mislead can
    be hidden: <em>R. v. L.L.</em>, 2009 ONCA 413, 96 O.R. (3d) 312, at paras. 16,
    44.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, we should not be taken as agreeing with all of the trial
    judge’s reasoning relating to the <em>Criminal Code</em>, s. 276 analysis, but
    we would not have found error in the ultimate decision to rule the prior sexual
    experience evidence to be inadmissible based on the balancing analysis under s.
    276(2)(d).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed, the convictions are set aside, and a new trial is
    ordered.</p>
