  <p class=Endorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this appeal, Mark Couper seeks to overturn a
    judgment ordering him to pay Rueters LLP approximately $422,000 for legal fees
    and disbursements, pre-judgment interest, and costs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, the appeal is
    dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Background in Brief </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In January 2011, Mr. Couper retained Rueter
    Scargall Bennett LLP, predecessor in interest to Reuters LLP (collectively
    “Rueters”), to represent him in a cross-border breach of contract case. Rueters
    was Mr. Couper’s third law firm to handle the litigation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Rueters provided Mr. Couper with legal services
    until March 2013. During that period, Rueters significantly advanced the case.
    Among other things, it readied the matter for pre-trial and trial, amended the
    pleadings, obtained additional disclosure, conducted examinations for
    discovery, attended several pre-trial and case conferences, and defeated a
    motion for summary judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, in March 2013, Rueters terminated the
    lawyer-client relationship because Mr. Couper refused to follow its legal advice
    on important issues. The culminating incident occurred when Mr. Couper
    instructed Rueters to bring a summary judgment motion based on advice he had received
    from other lawyers and contrary to Reuters’ advice. Rueters refused to bring
    the summary judgment motion, which it viewed as unwise. Mr. Couper accepted the
    termination of the relationship and voluntarily retained new counsel to replace
    Rueters.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the time of termination, Mr. Couper had paid
    only $10,000 of the fees of $333,951.50 (plus HST) which he owed Rueters. He
    also owed Rueters overdue disbursements of $2,703.12. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On April 16, 2013, the parties entered into a
    compromise compensation agreement (“CCA”) which resulted in a substantial fee
    reduction for Mr. Couper.  The CCA reduced Rueters’ fees to $300,000 (before
    HST); it also reduced the original premium of 5% of the judgment obtained to
    1%. Both sums were payable on judgment or settlement. The CCA further provided
    that Mr. Couper would pay the outstanding disbursements within three months. He
    did not make that payment.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In April 2016, Mr. Couper succeeded at trial and
    obtained a judgment of almost $700,000. In July 2016, he was awarded costs of
    the trial of approximately $780,000. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In August 2017, Rueters issued an account in
    accordance with the CCA. The account included the still-unpaid disbursements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Couper sought to have the account assessed
    but the Assessment Officer ruled he was without jurisdiction. Both parties then
    brought applications to determine appropriate fees for Rueters.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The applications judge found in favour of
    Rueters on both applications. By judgment dated November 12, 2019, Mr. Couper
    was ordered to pay Rueters $351, 402.75 plus prejudgment interest of $13,893.09
    and costs of $57,548.46 (the “Judgment”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Couper appeals the Judgment on three grounds.
    First, he submits that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part
    of the applications judge. This submission is largely based on the applications
    judge having presided over Mr. Couper’s motion opposing the confirmation of an
    assessment award regarding the fees of his trial counsel. Second, he submits that
    the applications judge erred in finding that Rueters had good reason to
    withdraw from its representation of him and did not require court approval for
    its withdrawal. Third, he submits that the applications judge erred in
    enforcing the CCA, which he contends is invalid. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>No Reasonable Apprehension of Bias </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no conduct of the applications judge
    that can be seen as evidence of prejudgment or bias on his part. On the
    contrary, the record shows that the applications judge acted fairly, and with patience
    and integrity, throughout these proceedings. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, the fact that the applications judge
    ruled against Mr. Couper in a related matter is inadequate to establish a
    reasonable apprehension of bias: <em>Watt v. Beallor Beallor Burns Inc.</em>,
    2004 CanLII 19821 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 13-14.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Rueters had Good Reason to Withdraw and Court
    Approval was not Required</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Couper asserts that the applications judge erred
    in determining that Rueters had good reason to withdraw from the solicitor-client
    relationship because the litigation was at a critical stage, he was prejudiced
    by its withdrawal, and court approval was required.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We reject this assertion and all of the
    arguments in support of it. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Counsel cannot abandon their clients on the eve
    of trial or a similarly acute point in the litigation. However, when Rueters terminated
    the solicitor-client relationship, the litigation was not at a critical stage.
    There were no imminent court dates nor was there work that could not be dealt
    with efficiently by new counsel. In fact, Mr. Couper’s new counsel was able to
    take the matter to trial quickly and was successful, obtaining judgment in his
    favour.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Nor was Mr. Couper prejudiced by Rueters’
    withdrawal. In rejecting Mr. Couper’s claim of prejudice flowing from that
    withdrawal, the applications judge found that Rueters had no liability for any
    costs arising from the withdrawal because Mr. Couper was “the author of his own
    misfortune”. He found that Mr. Couper was responsible for the material
    breakdown in the relationship for reasons that included his insistence that
    Rueters pursue the summary judgment motion, a motion that could have been
    strategically and financially disastrous for him. We agree with the
    applications judge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As for Mr. Couper’s contention that court approval
    was required, we begin by noting that Mr. Couper agreed that Rueters could
    remove itself from the record. Thus, in the circumstances of this case, there
    was no need for Rueters to obtain court approval. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, we endorse the applications judge’s
    rejection of Mr. Couper’s after-the-fact explanation for why his agreement was
    based on a misunderstanding. We also agree with the applications judge that had
    Rueters made such an application, it would have obtained court approval to
    remove itself from the record. As the applications judge found and is described
    briefly above, Mr. Couper was responsible for the material breakdown in the
    solicitor-client relationship. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We conclude on this issue by noting that the
    findings of the applications judge show that going to court for such approval
    would have been ill-advised and both parties knew that. It was clearly in Mr.
    Couper’s best interests that the change in counsel be accomplished as quickly, inexpensively,
    discreetly, and efficiently as possible. That is precisely what transpired.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The CCA was Valid</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this appeal, Mr. Couper has advanced a new
    issue, namely, that both his initial retainer agreement with Rueters and the
    CCA are invalid because they fail to comply with the requirements of <em>Contingency
    Fee Agreements</em>, O. Reg 195/04 to the <em>Solicitors Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. S. 15 (the “Regulation”). He did not advance this issue on the Applications.
    Rather, he argued that Rueters had breached the agreements. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As Mr. Couper did not raise the validity of the
    agreements below, he cannot raise it on appeal. This court has repeatedly
    explained the general rule that appellate courts will not entertain entirely
    new issues on appeal. See, for example, <em>Kaiman v. Graham</em><i>, </i>2009
    ONCA 77, 245 O.A.C. 130, at para. 18, and <em>Chuang v. Toyota Canada Inc.</em><i>, </i>2016 ONCA 852<i>, </i>at para. 4.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, even if the CCA were found not to
    comply with the Regulation, we agree with the applications judge’s implicit
    finding that the CCA was fair and reasonable. Therefore, it was enforceable.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Disposition</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is dismissed with costs to Rueters. If
    the parties are unable to agree on the quantum of those costs, they may make
    written submissions on that matter, to a maximum of three pages in length, such
    submissions to be received by this court no later than ten days from the date
    of release of these reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Further, this court affirms the applications
    judge’s order that Mr. Couper’s New Jersey counsel, Snellings Law, shall pay to
    Rueters forthwith, from the funds that it is holding in escrow, all amounts to
    which Rueters is entitled pursuant to the Judgment.  </span></p>
