  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Cornerstone Properties Inc.
    (“Cornerstone”), sought judgment against the respondent, Southside Construction
    Management Limited (“Southside”), in an amount equal to the total of various
    costs orders made in favour of Cornerstone and against 2108790 Ontario Inc.
    (“210”) in litigation concerning the validity of a debenture (the “debenture
    litigation”). Southside was not a party to that litigation, however,
    Cornerstone alleged Southside should be ordered to pay the costs that had been ordered
    against 210. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge dismissed Cornerstone’s action.
    He awarded costs of the action on a partial indemnity basis to Southside in the
    amount of $48,408.03. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Cornerstone appeals from the dismissal of the
    action. Cornerstone also seeks leave to appeal the costs order. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, the appeal from the
    dismissal of the action is dismissed. Leave to appeal costs is granted, and the
    costs are reduced to $25,000.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>Cornerstone and
    210 were involved in litigation arising out of Cornerstone’s efforts to remove
    a debenture from title to property (the “Urlindale Lands”) owned by Cornerstone
    and a related company. 210 succeeded at trial. Cornerstone successfully
    appealed and the matter was returned to the trial court. 210 was once again
    successful at trial. Cornerstone was once again successful on appeal. This
    court held the debenture was statute-barred and unenforceable.</span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>The total costs
    awarded to Cornerstone in the debenture litigation totalled $51,565.81. 210 had
    no assets. </span></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>When
    Cornerstone could not collect the costs from 210, it commenced this action
    against Southside. Southside controlled and funded 210. It beneficially owned
    all of the shares of 210. Southside had incorporated 210 as part of its efforts
    to acquire the Urlindale Lands. In furtherance of that purpose, it had caused
    210 to acquire the debenture that eventually became the subject of the
    litigation initiated by Cornerstone and defended by 210. It is common ground 210
    was a single purpose corporation directed and funded by Southside and/or related
    companies. </span></span></p>
  <h1><span class=MsoPageNumber><span lang=EN-CA>the main appeal</span></span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Costs can be awarded against a non-party. The
    jurisdiction to make that order, and the grounds on which the order can be
    made, were recently and thoroughly explained in <em>1318847 Ontario Limited v.
    Laval Tool and Mould Ltd.</em>, 2017 ONCA 184 (“<em>Laval Tool</em>”). There is
    no need to replough that ground in these reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Cornerstone submits the trial judge wrongly
    characterized its claim as an effort to pierce the corporate veil. Cornerstone
    further argues that, after the trial judge determined he would not pierce the
    corporate veil, he wrongly found he had no jurisdiction to require Southside to
    pay the costs ordered against 210. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Cornerstone is correct when it argues the powers
    to order costs against a non-party do not depend on whether the corporate veil
    of the entity against whom the costs were ordered can be pierced so as to reach
    the non-party from whom costs are sought. It is difficult, however, to agree
    that the trial judge mischaracterized Cornerstone’s claim. In its pleadings,
    Cornerstone alleged 210 had “no substance” and that its “separate legal
    persona” should be ignored. By this pleading, Cornerstone effectively asked the
    court to look through the separate corporate identity of 210 and impose
    liability on Southside. It was appropriate that the trial judge address this
    claim in his reasons. More to the point, on the largely uncontested evidence in
    this case, piercing the corporate veil was the only real chance Cornerstone had
    to render Southside liable for the costs order imposed on 210.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Lastly, we are satisfied that the trial judge’s
    characterization of the question, as one involving the piercing of the
    corporate veil, did not prejudice Cornerstone. Many of the considerations
    pertinent to that inquiry were also relevant to the existence of grounds to order
    Southside to pay 210’s costs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s second argument, that the trial
    judge, having determined he could not pierce the corporate veil, wrongly held
    he had no jurisdiction to require Southside, a non-party, to pay the costs
    ordered against 210, finds support in one passage in the trial judge’s reasons
    (see reasons, para. 22). However, in the paragraphs that follow, the trial
    judge explicitly recognizes the power to impose costs on a non-party, and
    refers to <em>Laval Tool</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, the
    governing authority</span></em>. The trial judge goes on to identify the two
    bases recognized in <em>Laval Tool</em> for an order of costs against a
    non-party. The first, under s. 131(1) of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.43, requires a finding the main plaintiff was “a person of
    straw” and not the actual litigant. The second, premised on the inherent
    jurisdiction of the court, looks to conduct by the non-party tantamount to an
    abuse of process. The trial judge’s reasons leave no doubt he appreciated both aspects
    of his jurisdiction to award costs against a non-party, and the bases upon
    which that order could be made.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is true the trial judge’s consideration of
    the merits of Cornerstone’s claim that Southside should pay the costs is brief.
    With respect, that brevity reflects the merits of Cornerstone’s claim that
    Southside should be responsible for 210’s costs.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Cornerstone did not suggest that it fell within
    the “person of straw” criterion for making an order of costs against a
    non-party: see <em>Laval Tool</em>, at paras. 59-62. It does argue its claim
    meets the abuse of process criterion identified in <em>Laval Tool</em>, at para.
    66:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In particular, apart from statutory
    jurisdiction, Superior Courts have inherent jurisdiction to order non-party
    costs, on a discretionary basis, in situations where the non-party has
    initiated or conducted litigation in such a manner as to amount to an abuse of
    process.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no evidence Southside used 210 in any
    way to abuse the court’s process or engage in dishonest or vexatious conduct in
    respect of any litigation. Southside incorporated 210 for a specific business purpose
    in respect of its attempted land acquisition. 210 acquired the debenture for
    that purpose. It did not initiate the debenture litigation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is wrong to suggest, as counsel for the
    appellant does in his factum, that “Southside ran Cornerstone up and down the
    court system twice and never relented”. Cornerstone initiated the debenture
    litigation and the appeals in that litigation. The history of the litigation
    demonstrates 210’s response to Cornerstone’s attempt to declare the debenture
    unenforceable was anything but an abuse of the court’s process. There were
    obviously legitimate issues in that litigation. Southside, by funding and
    directing 210’s defence, by loan or otherwise, did nothing to abuse the court’s
    process or undermine the fair administration of justice. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his supplementary submissions, counsel for
    the appellant gets to the real point of his submissions. He argues, that if a
    party has no funds to satisfy a costs order, and that party is a corporation
    controlled in the litigation by another corporation that does have funds,
    fairness and the purposes underlying costs orders dictate that the successful
    party should receive its costs from the directing corporate entity that has
    assets. This argument was rejected in <em>Laval Tool</em>: <em>Laval Tool</em>,
    paras. 63, 77, and runs directly against s. 15 of the <em>Business Corporations
    Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16. Counsel’s submissions, if accepted, would
    fundamentally change the accepted notions of corporate identity insofar as
    costs awards are concerned. It is an argument best addressed to the
    legislature. </span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>the costs appeal</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Assuming the order dismissing the action stands,
    Cornerstone does not quarrel with the trial judge’s order that Southside
    receive its costs of the action on a partial indemnity basis. Cornerstone does
    submit, however, an award of costs of $48,408.03, almost equal to the amount
    claimed in the action ($51,565.81), defeats the access to justice principle animating
    the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Simplified Procedure process in the
    rules, and is </span></em>inconsistent with the principles of proportionality
    in costs. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court has held parties to actions under the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>simplified rules procedure</span></em><em> </em>can
    reasonably expect reduced costs awards: <em>Williams Distinctive Gems Inc. v.
    Advantex Dining Corporation</em>, 2019 ONCA 702, at para. 15. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge did not specifically identify
    this action as governed by the <em><span style='font-style:normal'>Simplified
    Procedure process</span></em>. He did, however, refer to the amount of the
    claim and Cornerstone’s argument any costs awarded must be proportionate to the
    amount claimed. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The trial judge de-emphasized proportionality.
    He did so, having regard to what he viewed as the novelty of the claim, the
    importance of the case to Southside, and the very good work done by counsel on
    both sides. None of these factors justified the significant devaluation of the
    proportionality principle reflected in the amount awarded by the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This was not a complicated case. Nothing in the
    pleadings, pretrial proceedings or evidence suggested otherwise. The evidence
    took a little over a day. The facts were straightforward and largely uncontested.
    The entirety of the relevant case law could be found in <em>Laval Tool</em>, a
    very recent decision from this court. It is fair to say the action was unusual
    in the sense that claims for costs against non-parties are few and far between.
    The unusual nature of the claim did not, however, make it complex. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The importance of this case to Southside, beyond
    the money involved, is not self-evident and is not explained by the trial
    judge. Nor does the high quality of service provided by counsel warrant a departure
    from the proportionality principle.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge also made no reference to the
    unsuccessful security for costs motion brought by Southside at the commencement
    of the trial. The motion took slightly over half a day. Southside should have

    rate claimed by counsel for Southside was modest. We are satisfied, however, he
    failed to give any, much less sufficient, weight to the proportionality principle.
    The other factors identified by the trial judge did not justify abandoning the
    proportionality principle. In our view, that principle finds legitimate
    expression in an award of $25,000, inclusive of disbursements and taxes.</span></p>
