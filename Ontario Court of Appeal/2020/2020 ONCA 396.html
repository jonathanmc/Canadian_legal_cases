    of the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of sexual interference with a person under
    16 years of age and invitation to touching with a person under 16 years of age.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was eight to nine years old at the time of the alleged
    incidents. Her parents were separated. The complainant’s principal residence
    was with her mother. Her father had liberal access and the complainant spent
    some weekday nights and every second weekend at his home.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was the complainant’s father’s best friend and lived in
    his house. He was very close to the complainant who regarded him as an ‘uncle’.
    The father trusted the appellant explicitly and the complainant and the
    appellant were often alone together in the house.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2016, when the complainant was 15 years old, she told a school
    guidance counsellor, then her parents, and finally the police that in
    2009/2010, when she was eight to nine years old, the appellant sexually
    assaulted her. These assaults, she said, took place one to two times per week
    for about a year.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the trial, the complainant, her mother and her father testified.
    Although in her testimony the complainant described a year-long pattern of
    sexual abuse on many occasions, she focused on three incidents that she
    specifically described in detail: the birthday incident, the pornography
    incident, and the sexual intercourse incident. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the complainant was a reliable and credible
    witness. She convicted the appellant of sexual assault, sexual interference,
    invitation to sexual touching, and exposing his genitals. The sexual assault
    and exposing genitals charges were conditionally stayed on the basis of <em>R.
    v. Kienapple</em>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge imposed a sentence of six years imprisonment in addition
    to credit for 56 days of pre-sentence custody. The trial judge observed that
    the sentence would have been longer but for the fact that the appellant had
    been on bail for a lengthy period of time before the trial.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the conviction and the sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the conviction appeal, the appellant makes three arguments.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant contends the trial judge failed to address credibility and
    reliability concerns with respect to the complainant’s evidence and ignored
    flaws in the Crown’s case that were capable of raising a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission. The trial judge engaged in a very extensive and
    careful analysis of the testimony of a teenager trying to recall and describe
    traumatic events that had taken place approximately nine years before when she
    was eight or nine years old. The trial judge’s conclusion that the complainant
    was both credible and reliable was well supported by the evidence she accepted.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant submits that since the trial judge did not accept that actual
    intercourse took place during one of the alleged assaults, this should have led
    her to reject the complainant’s testimony about all of the alleged sexual
    events.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are not persuaded by this submission. A trial judge is entitled to accept all,
    some or none of a witness’ testimony. As stated above, in this case the trial
    judge engaged in a lengthy and careful review of the complainant’s evidence.
    For the most part, she believed the complainant. On one point – i.e., whether
    there was actual sexual intercourse on one occasion – the trial judge was
    entitled to conclude, based on the complainant’s description and the
    surrounding circumstances relating to her disclosure, that she was not
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that this component of the complainant’s
    description of a particular assault was made out. This inured to the
    appellant’s benefit.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant asserts that the complainant’s willingness to go to the
    appellant’s basement room belies her testimony that she was sexually abused
    almost weekly for an entire year. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The complainant was an eight-year-old girl who loved and trusted her
    ‘uncle’. It would be wrong to say that she must have had the intellectual and
    physical capacity to say ‘No’ to her uncle.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the sentence appeal, the appellant contends that the trial judge erred by not
    rejecting the entire incident where the complainant said that actual sexual
    intercourse occurred.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The trial judge was entitled to base her sentence on her findings
    relating to all of the events, including her partial acceptance of the
    complainant’s testimony relating to this particular event. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that, in fashioning his sentence, the trial judge did not
    give sufficient weight to his character letters or his own history of sexual
    abuse as a boy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    character letters were very general. Moreover, one of the overriding factors in
    sentencing a person who has sexually abused a child is to acknowledge the
    terrible harm child complainants suffer in these situations. The sentence
    imposed by the trial judge in this case is faithful to that overarching goal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction appeal is dismissed. The sentence appeal is dismissed except for the
    $200 victim surcharge per offence, which is set aside. </p>
