  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, Adam Chaleff is a Toronto voter. He
    appeals the application judge’s decision to grant the respondent, James
    Karygiannis, relief from forfeiture of his office arising out of the <em>Municipal
    Elections Act, 1996, </em>S.O. 1996, c. 32, Sched. (“the Act”) provisions
    relating to campaign finances.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent was re-elected a Councillor for
    the City of Toronto on October 22, 2018. Like all candidates for City Council, he
    was required to provide a financial statement outlining his campaign income and
    expenses.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent filed his financial statement on
    March 27, 2019.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Two complaints were received about his
    allocation of expenses and a compliance audit was ordered. The respondent was therefore
    allowed to file a Supplementary Financial Statement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On October 28, 2019, the respondent filed a Supplementary
    Financial Statement that showed he exceeded the allowable spending limit for expressions
    of appreciation during the 2018 election. Section 88.23(2) of the Act<em> </em>provides
    that the penalty for doing so is, among other things, automatic forfeiture of
    office.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On November 6, 2019, after reviewing the Supplementary
    Financial Statement, the City Clerk noted that the expenses he had submitted exceeded
    the allowable limit and advised the respondent that he was removed from office.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Five days later, the respondent applied for
    relief from forfeiture, claiming this was simply a good faith error in
    categorizing his expenses. On November 25, 2019, the application judge granted
    relief from forfeiture.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, who intervened in the proceedings
    below, claims the application judge had no jurisdiction to grant relief from
    forfeiture. Even if he did, he should not have exercised his discretion to do
    so in the circumstances of this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addressing the issue of whether there is
    jurisdiction to grant relief from forfeiture, I will first examine the rules
    governing spending limits for election campaigns and then look at the
    interpretation of the penalty provision of s. 88.23 based on the wording of the
    section, its meaning when considered in the context of the Act as a whole, and
    the intention of the legislators. I will then examine whether there is
    jurisdiction pursuant to s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act, </em>R.S.O.
    1990, c. C.43,<em> </em>to allow relief from forfeiture.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For reasons that follow, I conclude there is no
    jurisdiction to provide relief from forfeiture in the circumstances of this
    case. I would grant the appeal and set aside the order below. I would substitute
    a declaration that the respondent is subject to the penalties under s. 88.23(2)
    of the <em>Municipal Elections Act, </em>including forfeiture of his office.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Prue: If I could, by way of background, we
    have started to see that the section which was previously in the act is causing
    some considerable problems in municipal councils in Ontario.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The two most famous cases probably are those
    that involve the city of Mississauga and the city of Toronto. In the case of
    the city of Mississauga, upon looking at the case of <u>a person the council
    believed may have contravened the act,</u> they set about a process, the hiring
    of an auditor, to get to the bottom of the case. It <u>involved some $100,000
    of the city of Mississauga's tax money</u>. They then voted as a council near
    unanimously to take the alleged offender to court. <u>That has so far resulted
    in about another $100,000 in legal fees, and it probably will not be finalized
    before the next election. So in effect you have a person serving the full
    three-year term of office whom the auditor, the city council, the mayor,
    everyone, believe probably has contravened the <em>Municipal Elections Act</em></u> to get there.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Alternately, you have the case of the city of
    Toronto, which had two clearly well-documented cases of alleged improprieties
    against two of the members of the Toronto council. Upon the advice of the
    council and the mayor, who chose to do nothing, the aggrieved people are still
    before the courts nearly some two years later trying to get redress and to get
    people to listen to the complaint. Obviously, it is not working.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>So in the case where a city does something,
    there is a $200,000 bill attached to it; in the case where a city does nothing,
    the citizens get no redress. [Emphasis added]</span></p>

    from forfeiture under s. 98 of the <em>Courts of Justice Act</em>, his only
    recourse is to encourage the compliance audit committee to bring legal

    consequences for breach of very specific statutory requirements and the clear
    implication is that a candidate is not entitled to apply for relief from
    forfeiture in circumstances other than a s. 92 conviction. This is evidenced by
    the legislature’s </span>deliberate choice to simplify the enforcement process
    and remove the ability of the court to grant relief from forfeiture under s.

lang=EN-CA>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Unlike s. 92, s. 88.23 was meant to be a cost-effective and
    expeditious means of deterring and enforcing specific violations of the Act. Councillors
    are given the opportunity to change their financial statements before the filing
    deadline. Where there is a clear violation of these specific provisions of the
    Act, the municipality can remove the candidate immediately and at little cost. The
    legislative policy discussions describe the challenges resulting from including
    a good faith exception in s. 88.23 and the reasons for its removal.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Under the pre-2002 version of s. 88.23 of the Act, a candidate could
    apply to the Ontario Court (Provincial Division) for relief against automatic forfeiture
    of office, even if the candidate was not convicted of an offence. When that right
    existed, it by implication would have excluded s. 98 of the <em>Courts of
    Justice Act</em>, since it would have made no sense to have overlapping powers in
    the Superior Court to relieve against matters the legislature had already
    provided for in the Ontario Court. The removal of the right to apply to the
    Ontario Court, and the reasons why that was done, are inconsistent with a
    legislative intention to provide a right to apply to the Superior Court under

    debates prior to enactment suggests there were serious concerns about
    non-compliance and the costs and delays of enforcing the Act. Legislators

lang=EN-CA>The penalty imposed pursuant to s. 88.23 may be harsh in some cases but
    forfeiture is clearly what the legislators intended. It should be noted that honest
