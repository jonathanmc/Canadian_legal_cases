  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Benotto
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Historically, it has been difficult for a biological parent to obtain the
    right to access a child placed in the extended care of a children’s aid society
    (previously called “Crown Wardship”). There was a legislated presumption
    against access and there was a strict test to be met. The legislation at the
    time, the <em>Child and Family Services Act,</em> R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (“<em>CFSA</em>”),
    required that an applicant establish that the relationship “is beneficial and
    meaningful” to the child and that the access would not impair the child’s
    opportunities for adoption. This changed in 2018 when the CFSA was repealed and
    replaced with the <em>Child, Youth and Family Services Act</em>, 2017, S.O.
    2017, c. 14, Sched. 1 (“<em>CYFSA</em>”). The new legislation reflected a
    change in the approach to many aspects of child protection law, relating to
    children in care, including access. The former strict interpretation of a
    “beneficial and meaningful” relationship was expanded to incorporate a
    broadly-based best- interests analysis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court has referred to the significance of the change on more than
    one occasion. Yet, some lower courts continue to apply jurisprudence based on
    the old restrictive test. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, the trial judge applied the new approach to the determination of
    access for a mother and ordered access at the discretion of the children’s aid society.
    The appeal judge applied the old restrictive test, allowed the appeal and
    overturned the decision. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and restore the
    trial judge’s order. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>FACTS</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The underlying facts are not disputed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is the mother of A.G., who is two years old. The child is
    the fifth child born to the appellant. The other four children are in care. The
    facts articulated in the decisions below with respect to A.G. and the four
    siblings clearly establish that the mother is not able to care for the child.
    In fact, she did not dispute the finding that the child be in the extended care
    of the respondent, the Children’s Aid Society of Toronto (“the Society”). She
    only seeks continued access. The visits had been once-a-week on a fully
    supervised basis at the Society offices. The father of the child took no part
    in the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>DECISIONS BELOW</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Ontario Court </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The matter came before Sherr J. of the Ontario Court as a summary
    judgment motion for protection by the Society. He conducted a mini-trial in
    accordance with r. 16(6.2) of the <em>Family Law Rules</em>, O. Reg. 114/99. As
    part of that process he requested more evidence and heard oral evidence from
    the mother. Ultimately the mother consented to an extended society care order
    and the only issue before the court was her access to the child. Both the
    Society and the mother asked the court to make the determination on the basis
    of the evidence presented. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge set out in detail the positive and the negative aspects
    of the mother’s visits with the child. He also considered the pros and cons of
    the mother’s continued relationship with the child. One of the benefits of an
    ongoing relationship with the child included the fact that access to the
    child’s medical information and family history would be more readily available. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Society urged the court to follow the line of cases dating back to
    the <em>CFSA </em>that narrowly interpreted the words “beneficial and
    meaningful”. The trial judge rejected that approach and determined, based on
    the wording of the <em>CYFSA</em> and this court’s decisions interpreting it,
    that a more expansive inquiry was required. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the basis of this more expansive inquiry, he concluded that the benefits of the
    mother’s relationship with the child outweigh any detriments and that the
    relationship would be beneficial and meaningful for the child. He found that it
    was now, and would be in the future, in the child’s best interests for the
    biological mother to have access to the child at the discretion of the Society. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN>The Superior Court</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Society appealed the order allowing the mother access to the child at its
    discretion. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge concluded that the trial judge erred in assigning a new definition
    to the words “beneficial and meaningful” under the <em>CYFSA</em>. She reviewed
    the case law on the interpretation of the meaning of “beneficial and
    meaningful” and the different interpretations. She concluded that the more
    restrictive approach still applied. She also found that the trial judge erred
    by considering the potential for a future relationship because the court is
    called upon to consider whether the relationship “is” beneficial and
    meaningful, not whether it will become so in the future. Finally, she found
    that it was an error of law for the trial judge to refer to the future need for
    medical information, as this was entirely speculative. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will set out the legislative history and the case law. I will then discuss the
    significance of the changes in the <em>CYFSA</em> with respect to the
    determination of access.</p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    2004, the statute dealing with children in need of protection was the <em>CFSA</em>.
    Access to “Crown wards” was governed by s. 59, which stated: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Access:
    Crown ward </span></strong></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN-CA>(2.1) A
    court shall not make or vary an access order made under section 58 with respect
    to a Crown ward unless the court is satisfied that, </span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><a name="_Hlk42339109"><span
lang=EN-CA>(a) the relationship between the person and the child is beneficial
    and meaningful to the child; and </span></a></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN-CA>(b) the ordered access
    will not impair the child’s future opportunities for adoption. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    legislation also prevented a child from being adopted if there was an
    outstanding access order. When a child was about to be placed for adoption, the
    court was prevented from granting an access order except in extraordinary
    circumstances. Since courts had to choose between an access order or permanency
    for a child, the common law interpretation of the test for access to a Crown
    ward under the former <em>CFSA </em>was extremely, and intentionally,
    restrictive. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2011, the Legislature amended the <em>CFSA</em> to allow a child to be placed
    for adoption even when there was an outstanding access order. The amendments
    established a process for a Society to administratively terminate an access
    order by serving a notice of intention to place a child for adoption on persons
    named in the access order. The amendments broadened the ability for children to
    continue to have some form of contact with people who are important to them
    through “openness” after adoption. However, the test for access to a Crown ward
    did not change and courts continued to apply the same strict approach.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 30, 2018, the<em> CFSA</em> was replaced with the new <em>CYFSA</em>. The
    new legislation aimed to reduce the stigma of children in care, address Indigenous
    issues and import a broad best interests analysis into the determination of

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the coming-into-force of the <em>CYFSA</em>, two lines of cases developed. Both
    professed to follow the new law. One line of cases followed the old test. The
    other line of cases took an expansive approach. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to the case law under the <em>CFSA</em> and then refer to the two
    conflicting approaches that followed the implementation of the <em>CYFSA</em>.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Case law under the <i>CFSA</i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    most often cited case propounding the restrictive approach is <em>Children’s
    Aid Society of the Niagara Region v. M.J.,</em> 2004 CanLII 2667 (Sup. Ct.) at
    paras. 45 and 46. In it, Quinn J. looked to the dictionary definition of the
    words “beneficial and meaningful” under the CFSA:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>What is a “beneficial and meaningful”
    relationship in s. 59(2)(a)? Using standard dictionary sources, a “beneficial”
    relationship is one that is “advantageous.” A “meaningful” relationship is one
    that is “significant.” Consequently, even if there are some positive aspects to
    the relationship between parent and child, that is not enough – it must be
    significantly advantageous to the child.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>He also addressed the pertinence of the future
    relationship:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>I read s. 59(2)(a) as
    speaking of an </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>existing</span></em><span lang=EN> relationship between the person seeking access and the child, and not a </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>future</span></em><span lang=EN> relationship. This is important,
    for it precludes the court from considering whether a parent might cure his or
    her parental shortcomings so as to create, in time, a relationship that is
    beneficial and meaningful to the child. This accords with common sense, for the
    child is not expected to wait and suffer while his or her mother or father
    learns how to be a responsible parent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    time went by, judges routinely used the phrase “significantly advantageous”
    when interpreting the legislated “beneficial and meaningful” test. This was the
    genesis of the first line of cases. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Case law under the <i>CYFSA</i></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the new legislation came into force, the test set out by Quinn J. continued to
    be applied in some cases, e.g., <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/ht28p"><i><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Children’s Aid Society of Niagara</span></i></a><a
href="http://canlii.ca/t/ht28p"><i><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

href="http://canlii.ca/t/hswbh"><i><span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Niagara</em>, Pazaratz J. adopted the “significantly advantageous” term and
    also concluded that only the existing relationship be considered, not the
    future one. He also found that there remains a “presumption against access”
    under the <em>CYFSA</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Manitoulin</em>, Kukurin J. acknowledged that the <em>CYFSA</em> altered
    the test for access to a child in extended care but, for the terms “beneficial
    and meaningful” and “impair adoption”, he concluded at para 13: </p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…it might be
    argued that these have come down a notch in terms of importance, that they
    represent just two more factors among several that must be taken into account
    under the best interests analysis under the <em>CYFSA</em>, that they are no
    longer statutorily included as prerequisites for the access applicant; they are
    simply judicial considerations. I do not believe that this is really the end
    result of the legislative changes.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    courts have taken a different approach, reflecting a flexible interpretation of
    the test. The approach is summarized by Sager J. in <em>Jewish Family and Child
    Service of Greater Toronto v. K.B.</em>, 2018 ONCJ 650, at paras. 141-43, aff’d <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/j3g2x#par155"><i><span style='color:windowtext;

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The introduction of the best interests test in
    the </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>CYFSA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> brings a
    less rigid and more flexible approach to deciding whether to order access to a
    child placed in the extended care of the society, as a court is now permitted
    to give consideration to any factor it considers relevant, one can assume, on
    the well accepted principle in cases involving children that one size does not
    fit all. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>As the best interest analysis involves a
    consideration of what could be numerous factors, there cannot be a hard and
    fast rule as to how much weight a court </span><span class=Underline><span
lang=EN-CA>must</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> give any one factor including
    whether the relationship between the party seeking access and the child is
    beneficial and meaningful to the child. That must be determined on a case by
    case basis, by weighing all the relevant factors against the particular needs
    of the child before the court. This is a significant departure from the rigid
    test in the predecessor legislation. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>For some children
    who are the subject of an order of extended society care, a relationship with a
    parent may be in their best interests for a myriad of reasons. Some of those
    reasons would not have been sufficient to demonstrate a beneficial and
    meaningful relationship under the predecessor legislation to the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>CYFSA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>. The court ought not be confined
    to a one-dimensional definition of beneficial and meaningful under the </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>CYFSA</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, as to do so would be to
    potentially ignore the variety of needs children have as a result of being
    removed from their parents' care, both at the date of the order and in the
    future. For this reason, the test was altered in a significant way to one of
    best interests. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>

    words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the
    Act, and the intention of Parliament: <em>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v.
    Rex</em>, 2002 SCC 42, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, citing Elmer A.
    Driedger, <em>Construction of Statutes</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em>2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), at p.&nbsp; 87.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    therefore begin with a broad consideration of the scheme of the <em>CYFSA</em> and its object.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    requirement of the <em>CFSA </em>was that the Minister publicly review the Act,
    or specified provisions of it, every five years. These reviews were to be conducted
    by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services to enable the government to
    better understand how its laws, programs and policies are experienced on the
    ground. The information gathered as part of these reviews provided an
    opportunity for learning and change, and also supported the Ministry and its
    partners to provide high-quality services for children, youth and families in
    Ontario. In September 2014, the third legislative review of the <em>CFSA </em>was
    announced.</p>

    recommended a change in the language to reflect the realities of families and
    also recommended a change to the test for access to “Crown wards”. The <em>CYFSA </em>achieved both these objectives. </p>

    change for children in care. The </span></span><span lang=EN>age for protection
    was raised from 16 to 18. The archaic and stigmatizing term “Crown ward” was
    replaced with “extended society care”. Other </span>key changes included:</p>

    paramount purpose of the Act remained as it had been: “to promote the best
    interests, protection and well-being of children” (s. 1(1)). Other purposes in
    s. 1(2) emphasize the best interests of children: </p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>(2) The
    additional purposes of this Act, so long as they are consistent with the best interests,
    protection and well-being of children, are to recognize the following:</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>1. While
    parents may need help in caring for their children, that help should give
    support to the autonomy and integrity of the family unit and, wherever
    possible, be provided on the basis of mutual consent.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>2. The least
    disruptive course of action that is available and is appropriate in a
    particular case to help a child, including the provision of prevention
    services, early intervention services and community support services, should be
    considered.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>3. Services
    to children and young persons should be provided in a manner that,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>i.
    respects a child’s or young person’s need for continuity of care and for stable
    relationships within a family and cultural environment,</span></p>

    into account physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and developmental needs and
    differences among children and young persons,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>iii.
    takes into account a child’s or young person’s race, ancestry, place of origin,
    colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, family diversity, disability, creed, sex,
    sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression,</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeSubquote><span lang=EN>iv. takes

    includes the participation of a child or young person, the child’s or young
    person’s parents and relatives and the members of the child’s or young person’s<b> </b>extended family and community, where appropriate.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>4. Services
    to children and young persons and their families should be provided in a manner
    that respects regional differences, wherever possible.</span></p>
  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>5. Services

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span lang=EN>6. First
    Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples should be entitled to provide, wherever

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    importantly for this case, the new Act changed the criteria for access to
    children in extended care by removing the presumption against access and making
    the child’s “best interests” predominant in determining access. As stated by
    this court in <em>Kawartha </em>and repeated in <em>Peel</em>, the change was
    not “just semantics” but represented “a significant shift in the approach to access
    for children in extended care.” Some of the changes to the test for access
    include:  </p>

  <p class=LegislativeQuote><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There is no longer a “presumption against

    Act.”  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    changes and this court’s statements clearly inform the analysis of the three
    issues articulated in this case. I turn to those issues now.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN>Issue 1: Has the test for access under the <i>CYFSA</i> changed the meaning of a “beneficial and meaningful” relationship?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent points out that the <em>CYFSA</em> did not change the words “a
    relationship between the person and the child is beneficial and meaningful to
    the child”. The respondents contend that, with the words still intact, the
    interpretation of the phrase stands, and the pre-<em>CYFSA </em>interpretation
    still applies. To support this proposition, the respondent relies on this
    court’s decision in <em>Huron-Perth Children’s Aid Society v. J.L.</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2019 ONCA 809. The respondent says
    that, in <em>Huron-Perth</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span> </em>this
    court endorsed the pre-<em>CYFSA</em> definition of beneficial and meaningful. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree. This court’s decision in <em>Huron-Perth</em> offers no support
    for the respondent’s position. The issues in that case had nothing to do with
    the test for access.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Huron-Perth</em><span lang=EN-CA>,</span><em><span lang=EN-CA> </span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>t</span>he first appeal judge considered fresh evidence and <em>allowed</em> the parents’ appeal on the issue of access, <em>granting</em> access between
    the parents and children. The parents then appealed to this court on the basis
    that the first appeal judge had not gone far enough. They submitted that, on
    the basis of fresh evidence, the trial judge should not <em>only </em>have
    awarded access but instead should have reversed the Crown wardship/no access
    order. This court saw no basis to interfere with the first appeal judge’s
    decision to grant access to the parents. This court’s decision does not endorse
    the pre-CYFSA approach to access for it had nothing to do with the access test. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, this court’s decision in <em>Kawartha </em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>directly addressed the new access test</span></em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. </span></em><em>Kawartha </em>overturned the
    Divisional Court decision below in part <em>because</em> applying the old
    restrictive access test was identified as a legal error. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent also argues that the 2004 decision in <em>Niagara</em> reflects the
    proper approach to the determination of the words “beneficial and meaningful”.
    I disagree. It does not advance the scope or purpose of the legislation to
    apply dictionary definitions of a word or a phrase untethered from the context
    of the Act. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>The respondent further argues that there is no reason to depart from
    the </span>pre-<em>CYFSA </em>judicial interpretation of “beneficial and
    meaningful relationship” as meaning a “significantly advantageous”
    relationship. Again, I disagree. The judicial injection of the words
    “significantly advantageous” into the analysis may have applied under the old Act
    but it falls far short of the expansive best interests considerations under the
    new <em>CYFSA</em>. <a name="_Hlk42766790"></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CYFSA </em>is remedial legislation enacted for the protection of society’s
    most vulnerable children. It must be liberally construed to the benefit of the
    child. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN>The new access test is no longer a “beneficial and meaningful” test. It
    is </span>now a best interests test with a statutory requirement to consider
    whether the relationship is beneficial and meaningful for the child <em>as one
    aspect</em> of that analysis. When a court considers a child’s best interests
    it should consider all relevant factors, including – as I discuss below –
    whether past, present or future. The new access test now permits the court to
    conduct a more holistic and comprehensive analysis of what is best for a child. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    adopting a best interests test to determine access, the legislature changed the
    previous highly restrictive test that had tended towards termination of access
    between children and those important to them. Access can be now be ordered for
    a child in extended care if it truly is in the overall best interests of the
    child. The overall best interests involve a consideration of the 15 articulated
    factors <em>plus</em> “any other circumstance of the case that the person
    [deciding the case] considers relevant”: s. 74(3)(c). Under s.105(6), whether
    the relationship is “beneficial and meaningful to the child” and <em>only if
    the court considers it relevant</em>, whether the ordered access will impair
    the child’s future opportunities for adoption remain relevant, but only as
    viewed through a global best interests lens.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN>Issue 2: Can the benefits of a future
    relationship be considered?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge concluded that the trial judge erred in law when he said, at para.
    81, that a child’s best interests include “<span class=Underline>all</span> relevant factors, ‘whether they be past, present or future considerations’”
    (emphasis in original). The appeal judge concluded that “While this would be
    true for the factors set out in s. 74(3), it does not hold true when
    considering whether there is a beneficial or meaningful relationship between
    the child and the parent.” In coming to this conclusion, she relied on <em>Manitoulin</em> which held that the relationship “is” beneficial and meaningful. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    “beneficial and meaningful” test is not a separate pre-condition as it was
    before. Instead, it is a consideration within the context of the child’s best
    interests.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    child’s best interests clearly are not static. This is confirmed by the wording
    of s. 74(3) which requires the court to consider: (i) <span class=Underline>any</span> other circumstance of the case; (ii) the child’s<span class=Underline> development</span> of a positive relationship; (iii) <span class=Underline>continuity</span> in
    the child’s care and the <span class=Underline>possible </span>effect on the
    child of disruption of that continuity; (iv) the <span class=Underline>risk</span> that the child <span class=Underline>may</span><span class=Underline><span
style='text-decoration:none'> </span></span>suffer harm through being removed
    from, kept away from, returned to or allowed to remain in the care of a parent
    [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    underlined words all demand considerations that continue through time. There is
    simply nothing in the plain wording of the current Act to suggest that access
    should be decided without reference to the future.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not err by taking future considerations into account. </p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Issue 3: </span><span lang=EN>Did the trial
    judge err by referring to the child’s medical information and family history?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge considered as one of the benefits of access that it “could mean that
    [the child’s] medical information and family history will be more readily
    available”. The appeal judge concluded that this was speculation: “There was no
    evidence presented at trial in this regard and therefore this equates to an
    error of law”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was not an error of law to refer to medical history and information for several
    reasons. First, I have set out above that the best interests analysis properly includes
    consideration of the future. Second, this factor was only one of ten listed by
    the trial judge in his consideration of the benefits of access. Third, it was
    not speculative: the child had significant medical issues as a result of
    premature birth. There was no error in the trial judge’s common-sense
    conclusion that a child with significant medical issues could benefit from some
    form of continuing contact with his biological mother.</p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Presumption and onus</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    concluding, I wish to address the respondent’s submissions with respect to
    presumption and onus.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits that there remains a presumption against access and the onus
    rests with the person seeking access. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no longer a presumption against access. This was confirmed in <em>Kawartha</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 31,</span> </em>and <em>Peel</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 70</span></em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of onus is more nuanced. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not find it helpful to import the concept of onus when the court is required
    to consider and balance the various factors that affect the life of a child in
    protection. The court is not called upon to determine past events and to make
    findings. Instead the court must consider and weigh a number of factors, past,
    present and future. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is an analogy here to what has been said of the court’s approach when
    considering whether a young person should be tried in youth or adult court.
    Like the best interests analysis, the relevant legislation for youthful
    offenders requires the court to weigh and balance enumerated factors. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>R. v. A.O.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2007 ONCA
    144, 84 O.R. (3d) 561, this court considered the question of onus in connection

    court. The court said, at para. 33:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN>[The section of the Act] refers to an onus of “satisfying”

lang=EN>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446, [1989] S.C.J. No. 93, 50 C.C.C. (3d) 503, at pp.
    463-64 S.C.R., pp. 546-48 C.C.C. when it assessed the nature of the onus on a
    party seeking a transfer to adult court … Justice McLachlin, as she then was,
    distinguished an onus “to satisfy” from the criminal onus of proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt. Speaking for the majority, she said: </span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>Parliament set out in detail the factors which
    must be weighed and balanced, and stipulated that if after considering them the
    court was satisfied that it was in the interests of society and the needs of
    the young person that he or she should be transferred, the order should be
    made.</span></p>
  <p class=DSubquote><span lang=EN>Nor do I find it
    helpful to cast the issue in terms of civil or criminal standard of proof.
    Those concepts are typically concerned with establishing whether something took
    place. It makes sense to speak of negligence being established “on a balance of
    probabilities”, or to talk of the commission of a crime being proved “beyond a
    reasonable doubt”. But it is less helpful to ask oneself whether a young person
    should be tried in ordinary court “on a balance of probabilities”. One is not
    talking about something which is probable or improbable when one enters into
    the exercise of balancing the factors and considerations set out in [the Act].
    The question rather is whether one is satisfied, after weighing and balancing
    all the relevant considerations, that the case should be transferred to
    ordinary court. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the court here was not being asked to make findings of fact about past events.
    A child’s best interests in connection with future access involve a delicate
    weighing and balancing of multiple factors. It is not a fact-finding mission
    and the exercise is not assisted by determining what the onus is or where it
    lies. </p>
  <p class=Heading><a name="_Toc40515"><span lang=EN-CA>CONCLUSION</span></a></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <em>CYFSA </em>requires a new approach to determining access. I note too that
    access can come in many forms that depart from in-person visits. The exchange
    of gifts, emails, video chats or phone calls are all forms of access. The form
    and frequency of access should be tailored to the child’s specific needs and age-appropriate
    wishes.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    adopt the words of Sager J. relied on by the trial judge, as set out in <em>Jewish
    Family and Child Service</em>:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The introduction of the best interests test in
    the <em>CYFSA</em> brings a less rigid and more flexible approach to deciding
    whether to order access to a child placed in the extended care of the society,
    as a court is now permitted to give consideration to any factor it considers
    relevant, one can assume, on the well accepted principle in cases involving
    children that one size does not fit all. </span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara>The trial judge here endorsed this approach and added:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>When a court
    considers a child’s best interests it should consider </span><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>all</span></span><span lang=EN-CA> relevant
    factors, whether they be past, present or future considerations. That is what
    courts do in making custody and access decisions </span><span lang=EN-CA>–</span><span
lang=EN-CA> there is a predictive element in all of these decisions. There is
    no need for a court to confine itself to past or present circumstances in
    conducting its analysis. The new access test now permits the court to conduct a
    more holistic and comprehensive analysis of what is best for a child. The more
    expansive analysis will permit courts to make the best possible decisions for
    children. [Emphasis in original.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge applied the correct approach. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal and restore the trial judge’s determination as to
    access. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    party requested costs, so I would not order costs. </p>
