lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants, 1835923 Ontario Limited (“183”)
    and Dudett A. Kumar, appeal the judgment of the motion judge in the respondent
    Royal Canadian Mortgage Investment Corporation’s mortgage enforcement action.
    The motion judge ordered the appellants to, among other things, pay the
    respondent $626,719.59 on account of principal money, fees and interest to
    October 30, 2018 under the mortgage and deliver possession of the mortgaged
    property to the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is scheduled to be heard January 16,
    2020. I am advised that Surinder Kumar is a director of 183 and represents the
    appellant 183 pursuant to an order of the Superior Court of Justice, and, in
    this court, with the consent of the respondent. He does not represent his wife,
    the appellant Dudett A. Kumar, who guaranteed the mortgage debt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>These are my reasons for denying Mr. Kumar’s
    request for an adjournment of the appeal on January 13, 2020, and the terms on
    which I ordered that the appeal proceed on January 16, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As Harvison Young J.A. recounted in her reasons
    setting aside the registrar’s dismissal for delay of this appeal, the
    appellants had requested and received two adjournments before the respondent’s
    summary judgment motion was heard and decided on October 30, 2018. Their
    request for a further adjournment of the October 30, 2018 date was denied: (25
    July 2019) M50643 (C66207) (Ont. C.A.), at para. 1. Their attendance before
    Harvison Young J.A. was the third time they had come before this court, seeking
    an extension of time to perfect their appeal: M50643, at para. 2.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Harvison Young J.A. wrote as follows, at para.
    8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The explanations for the delay have been thin.
    In my view, a review of all the delays reveals that the appellants’ conduct
    have [sic] been marked by a pattern of delay, failure to meet deadlines and
    repeated requests for adjournments. When considered as a whole, this pattern of
    delay leads inexorably to the conclusion that delay has been an integral part
    of the appellants’ litigation strategy.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>She added that “it is difficult to see merit to
    the appeal, even appreciating that this is a low bar [on a motion for an
    extension of time]”: at para. 10. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, she ordered that if the outstanding
    documents to perfect the appeal were filed no later than August 9, 2019, the
    registrar’s dismissal for delay would be set aside. The appellants filed the
    outstanding documents, and the appeal was scheduled to be heard on January 16,
    2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On January 3, 2020, Mr. Kumar sought the consent
    of the respondent to an adjournment of the appeal until mid-March 2020. He
    wrote that over the holiday, he was diagnosed with a health issue related to
    his eyesight, and the vision in his left eye is now substantially compromised,
    likely as a complication due to diabetes. He advised that he would be unable to
    represent the appellants on January 16, 2020 because, due to severely
    compromised vision in his left eye, it would be impossible for him to
    adequately prepare, given the “voluminous” materials he would need to review.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By letter dated January 6, 2020, the respondent
    opposed the appellants’ request for an adjournment. Mr. Kumar then contacted
    the court office, requesting an adjournment. His request, and the communication
    between Mr. Kumar and the respondent, was forwarded to me, as the President of
    the panel scheduled to hear the appeal on January 16, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent had alluded to a Mr. Robert Maki,
    who, it says, appeared as agent for the appellants multiple times in this
    proceeding, both in this court and in the Superior Court of Justice, where he, among
    other things, argued the summary judgment motion. The respondent questioned why
    the appellant now stated that he needed time to find legal counsel when Mr.
    Maki had previously acted as the agent for the appellants. At my request, court
    staff scheduled a conference call with Mr. Kumar and Mr. Corsianos, counsel for
    the respondent. Mr. Kumar was asked to follow up with Mr. Maki before that call
    as to his availability to argue the appeal and as to what medical confirmation
    he could provide for the recent deterioration of his medical condition. Court
    staff subsequently requested that Mr. Maki be asked to participate in the
    conference call.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The conference call was held on January 9, 2020.
    In advance of that call, Mr. Kumar deposed that Mr. Maki was not available on
    January 16, 2020 and provided a note from a doctor at a medical centre whom Mr.
    Kumar indicated is not his regular physician. The doctor’s letter merely stated
    that Mr. Kumar was seen on January 8, 2020, is unwell, and will not be able to
    attend his January 16, 2020 court date. There is no reference in the doctor’s
    letter to severely compromised vision in his left eye.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the context of this matter, including the
    pattern of delay, I was not satisfied with the medical note provided or Mr.
    Kumar’s assertion that Mr. Maki was not available on January 16, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I adjourned the conference call to Monday,
    January 13, 2020. I asked Mr. Kumar to provide medical confirmation that his
    eye prevented him from attending on January 16, 2020 and that Mr. Maki participate
    on the call on January 13, 2020 or that Mr. Kumar arrange for other counsel to
    participate.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before the call on January 13, 2020, I reviewed
    the materials filed for the appeal. I would not characterize the materials as
    voluminous. The appellants’ factum is nine pages in length (ten, including the
    signature of Mr. Kumar). In my view, any counsel whom the appellants might
    retain on a limited scope retainer to make oral submissions based on the
    written materials filed would not require long to prepare.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In advance of the call, Mr. Kumar supplied an
    email from Mr. Maki, who wrote that “I have never been on the record on this
    file, I’m not involved and do not know what is going on”. Mr. Maki’s email does
    not say that he is unable to assist on January 16, 2020. Mr. Kumar advised the
    court that a lawyer, Amarnath Misir, would participate in the call. Mr. Kumar
    also provided confirmation of an appointment on March 3, 2020 with a doctor
    whose letterhead refers to “Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism”. Again, there was
    no indication that his eyesight prevents him from reading documents.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On the call, Mr. Misir advised he had been
    contacted on January 10, 2020, had not reviewed anything, was open to a limited
    scope retainer, but was not available for six to eight weeks. Mr. Misir was
    unaware of the history of delay in this matter.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mr. Kumar’s ability to respond to requests for
    further information and participate in the conference calls did not appear to
    be affected. In the context of the pattern of delay in this matter and the lack
    of medical evidence supporting what Mr. Kumar indicated was the reason he
    cannot attend on January 16, 2020, I am of the view that this adjournment
    request is simply an attempt to delay enforcement of the mortgage.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result, on January 13, 2020, I denied the
    adjournment. I ordered that if Mr. Kumar or an agent did not appear for 183,
    and Mrs. Kumar did not appear, on January 16, 2020, then the panel would hear
    the appeal, relying on the materials that have been filed by the parties, and,
    to ensure that the respondent was not perceived as having an advantage over the
    appellants, Mr. Corsianos would not be provided with an opportunity to make
    oral submissions. Mr. Corsianos was agreeable to this.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
lang=EN-CA>I further advised that if the panel has any questions which are not
    addressed by the parties’ written materials, then the panel would invite the
    parties to address those additional issues in writing. These terms ensure that
    the matter will be considered on its merits, by the full panel. In my view, the
    appellants will not be prejudiced if they do not make oral submissions.
    Further, in my view, in all the circumstances, this is a just disposition.</span></p>
