  <p><b><span lang=EN-CA>Pardu J.A.: </span></b></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from convictions for trafficking in persons over
    the age of 18 years and theft. He submits that the trial judge erred in her
    charge to the jury in three respects and further by amending the indictment
    charging theft. Specifically, the appellant argues that the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>provided misleading
    instructions on the meaning of exploitation as defined in s. 279.04(1) of the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA style='font-style:
normal'>, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46;</span></em></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did not adequately
    relate the Facebook messages from the complainant to the appellant to the
    principles governing prior inconsistent statements and explain more fully the
    significance those messages had for the complainant’s credibility;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><a
name="_Hlk29378367">(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    not adequately explain psychological safety as it relates to the definition of
    exploitation; and</a></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>(4)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>inappropriately
    amended the indictment from an allegation that the appellant stole four cell
    phones and a tablet to theft of three cell phones and a tablet, to conform to
    the complainant’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept these arguments and would dismiss the appeal from
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also appeals from his sentence, alleging the trial judge
    erred in failing to consider his pretrial custody. The Crown concedes that the
    appellant should have been given this credit. I would allow the appeal from
    sentence and vary the sentence accordingly. </p>
  <h1>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BACKGROUND</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant was homeless and living in a shelter when she met the
    appellant. She was about 18 or 19 years old. She was working as a sex trade
    worker. Her two children were in custody of the Children’s Aid Society. The
    appellant offered her a place to live in his apartment. They were together for
    approximately seven years. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant said the appellant led her to believe she could have a
    better life and he would adopt her children if she worked hard. She testified
    that he mentally abused and controlled her, saying that he:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>kept most of the money she earned</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>took calls from clients, posted ads for her, told her what to
    charge clients, and devised a pseudonym for her </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>sometimes hid in the hotel room when she was with a customer, and </p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>called her lazy for not wanting to work and not taking calls from
    clients. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She said she tolerated the way he treated her because she had nowhere to
    go, no money, no friends or family to turn to, and he was all she had. She also
    said that, despite not being in a romantic relationship with the appellant, she
    felt attached to and invested in him due to the time and money she had given
    him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She had hundreds of clients over the years when she was with the
    appellant. During cross-examination, the complainant said that no one told her
    there would be consequences if she refused a client. Sometimes she left the
    appellant and went to other cities, although she still provided him with her
    earnings from Edmonton, for example.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not testify. At trial, his defence was that he was the
    complainant’s friend who helped her with various aspects of her sex trade work,
    at the complainant’s request. The appellant also took the position that the
    complainant chose to work in the sex trade of her own free will and denied any
    coercion or violence on his part.</p>
  <h1>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>STATUTORY PROVISIONS</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged under section 279.01(1)
    of <em>Criminal Code</em>, which reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Every person who recruits, transports,
    transfers, receives, holds, conceals or harbours a person, or exercises
    control, direction or influence over the movements of a person, for the purpose
    of exploiting them or facilitating their exploitation is guilty of an
    indictable offence…</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>Exploitation is defined under section
    279.04(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>For the purposes of sections 279.01 to 279.03,
    a person exploits another person if they cause them to provide, or offer to
    provide, labour or a service by engaging in conduct that, in all the
    circumstances, could reasonably be expected to cause the other person to
    believe that their safety or the safety of a person known to them would be
    threatened if they failed to provide, or offer to provide, the labour or
    service.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first element of the offence is an action by
    the accused, who must be a person who “recruits, transports, transfers,
    receives, holds, conceals or harbours a person, or exercises control, direction
    or influence over the movements of a person”. This court explained the meaning
    of “influence” in this context in <em>R. v. Gallone</em>, 2019 ONCA 663, 147
    O.R. (3d) 225, at para. 47:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Consistent with <em>Perreault</em>, I would
    define “exercises influence” over the movements of a person for the purposes of
    s. 279.01(1) as something less coercive than “exercises direction”. Exercising
    influence over a person’s movements means doing anything to affect the person’s
    movements. Influence can be exerted while still allowing scope for the person’s
    free will to operate. This would include anything done to induce, alter, sway,
    or affect the will of the complainant. Thus, if exercising control is like
    giving an order that the person has little choice but to obey, and exercising
    direction is like imposing a rule that the person should follow, then
    exercising influence is like proposing an idea and persuading the person to
    adopt it. [Footnote omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There was no substantial dispute as to this
    element of the offence at trial. There can be no doubt the appellant exercised
    influence over the complainant by persuading her to live with him, by telling
    her how much to charge customers, and by posting ads for her to work as a sex
    trade worker, among other things.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The second element is that the accused’s actions
    must be for the purpose of exploiting or facilitating the exploitation of the
    complainant. Actual exploitation is not required. The focus is on the accused’s
    state of mind. Where exploitation arises on the facts, “inferring that the
    accused’s purpose was to exploit the victim will usually be a relatively
    straightforward task”: <em>Gallone</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 54; <em>R. v. A.A.</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> 2015 ONCA 558, 327 C.C.C. (3d) 377, at para. 87.</span></p>

    threatened if they failed to provide, or offer to provide, the labour or

  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided proper instructions on the meaning of
    exploitation as defined in s. 279.04(1) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Criminal
    Code</span></em></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant points to the following section of the charge:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Let us look at the definition of
    “exploitation”. We can take out the words “or the safety of a person known to
    them,” because there is no evidence that [the complainant] felt the safety of
    another person would be threatened. The labour or service [the complainant]
    said she provided was that of prostitution. It is not necessary for this
    offence that you find that prostitution occurred, though [the complainant]
    testified that it did. As well, if you accept [the complainant’s] testimony as
    to Mr. Sinclair advertising her sexual services on certain websites known for
    this purpose, or answered calls on her behalf, then that conduct would come
    with the definition of “offer to provide a service”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant says this instruction was unclear and
    conflated the activity of offering to provide services for a complainant with
    forcing a complainant to offer to provide services. He argues that the trial
    judge essentially told the jury that because the appellant advertised the
    complainant’s services and answered calls for the complainant, his behaviour
    fell within the definition of “offering to provide a service.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree. In this portion of the charge,
    the trial judge was addressing the third element as described above, about
    which there was little controversy. This portion of the charge had nothing to
    do with the appellant’s purpose or whether the conduct was exploitive. </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge provided proper instructions regarding the <span

lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave the jury full and legally
    correct instructions on the use of prior inconsistent statements. She reminded
    the jury that the complainant had agreed that she had numerous communications
    with the appellant on Facebook, that they would have the written communications
    with them in the jury room, and that she was not going to go through them in
    her charge. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This was sufficient in the context of a three-day
    jury trial, given that the jury had the written communications with them during
    their deliberations. The jury acquitted the appellant of two counts of assault
    and one count of withholding documents, so it is clear the jury did not
    uncritically accept the complainant’s testimony. </span></p>
  <h2>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge adequately explained “psychological safety” as it
    relates to the definition of exploitation</h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury on this issue as follows:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The reference to safety in the above
    definition requires further elaboration. This definition does not require that [the
    complainant’s] safety actually be threatened, and safety includes a
    consideration of psychological safety.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Based on all of
    the evidence, if you find either that it was reasonable that [the complainant]
    felt her safety was threatened, or simply that it could reasonably be expected
    that a person in [the complainant’s] situation would believe that her safety,
    either physical or psychological, was threatened, for example by any conduct
    that you find Mr. Sinclair said or did to her, that part of the definition
    would also be met. The test to be proved by the Crown is not whether [the
    complainant] was actually threatened. The test is whether you find the conduct
    of Mr. Sinclair in all the circumstances, could reasonably be expected to cause
    [the complainant] to believe that her safety was threatened.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>So the evidence
    related to this question is: [the complainant] testified that she felt she had
    to go to work as a prostitute, because she was afraid of Mr. Sinclair, in other
    words that her safety was threatened. She said he did punch her on one occasion
    and tipped her out of a chair on another occasion when he was angry. You will
    recall that she also said they had numerous arguments in which he insulted her.
    She said he threw the fact that her children were taken by the CAS in her face.
    Remember what I said about “safety” including “psychological safety” as well as
    “physical safety”.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[The complainant] also testified that Mr.
    Sinclair kept most of the money she made as a prostitute. [The complainant]
    said she had no place to live; she had no friends or family. [The complainant]
    told you that she stayed because she was emotionally abused by Mr. Sinclair,
    and he was all she had.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree that the trial judge needed to
    import the notions of actual “serious bodily harm” or “subjective fear for
    safety” drawn from other statutory contexts. The use of the word “safety” in
    itself suggests more than a trivial interference with either physical or
    psychological well-being. The assessment here was an objective one: could the appellant’s
    conduct be reasonably expected “to cause [the complainant] to believe that her
    safety was threatened.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the circumstances of this case, no prejudice
    was occasioned by the trial judge’s failure to further define “safety” or
    “psychological”. On a functional review of the charge, the submissions of
    counsel, and the evidence adduced at trial, I am satisfied that the jury was
    “left with a sufficient understanding of the facts as they relate to the
    relevant issues”: <em>R. v. Jacquard</em>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at para. 14.
    Put another way, “the jurors would adequately understand the issues involved,
    the law relating to the charge the accused is facing, and the evidence they
    should consider in resolving the issues”: <em>R. v. Cooper</em>, [1993] 1
    S.C.R. 146, at p. 163; <em>R. v. Newton</em>, 2017 ONCA 496, 349 C.C.C. (3d)
