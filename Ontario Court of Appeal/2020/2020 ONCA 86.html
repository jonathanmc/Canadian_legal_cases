  <p class=Onappealfrom align=left style='text-align:left'>On appeal from the designation
    as a dangerous offender and the indeterminate sentence imposed by Justice Lynn
    D. Ratushny, of the Superior Court of Justice, dated June 8, 2015.</p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement>REASONS FOR DECISION</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a paedophile. He pled guilty to, and was convicted of,
    21 offences, including 12 counts of child internet luring, 3 counts of sexual
    touching, and 1 count of sexual interference. The offences occurred over a
    40-month period between 2008 and 2011. The victims were children between the
    ages of 11 and 16. The appellant has a criminal record for similar offences
    going back to about 2004.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. On June 8, 2015, the
    trial judge granted that application, declared the appellant a dangerous
    offender, and imposed an indeterminate sentence in the penitentiary. The
    appellant appeals. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts relevant to the appellant’s many offences, his history within
    the criminal justice system since about 2005 and various psychiatric assessments,
    including the assessment of Dr. Pallandi, prepared for the purposes of the
    dangerous offender hearing, are fully and accurately summarized in the trial
    judge’s reasons: 2015 ONSC 2590. We need not repeat them. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Grounds of Appeal</p>
  <h4>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge err in her interpretation of the requirements of ss.
    753(1)(a)(i) and (ii)?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that, in deciding whether the criteria in ss.
    753(1)(a)(i) or (ii) were met, the trial judge focused exclusively on the
    appellant’s prior conduct and did not engage in any “meaningful analysis of
    future risk”. The appellant contends that, as made clear in <em>R. v. Boutilier</em>,
    2017 SCC 64, future risk is an integral part of the s. 753(1)(a)(i) and s. (ii)
    analysis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree that an assessment of the threat posed to the safety of the
    public in the future by the appellant’s conduct is a component of the analysis
    under the relevant provisions. We disagree that the trial judge did not have
    regard to future risk assessments in considering the applicability of ss.
    753(1)(a)(i) and (ii). </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did review the appellant’s prior conduct at length. She
    was required to do so for the purposes of assessing future risk. On this
    evidence, the nature and duration of the appellant’s prior conduct provided
    powerful evidence of how the appellant would act in the future, if given the
    opportunity. The evidence of the appellant’s prior conduct was strongly
    suggestive of a significant future risk. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not stop, however, at the appellant’s prior conduct.
    She specifically referred to, and considered, the assessment of Dr. Pallandi.
    That assessment spoke directly to future risk. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Dr. Pallandi’s assessment, he indicated that the appellant might be
    managed in the community if several steps were taken. The first required the
    appellant to agree to take long-acting intramuscular sex drive-reducing
    medication. The appellant had, however, indicated to Dr. Pallandi that he did
    not believe that the medication was necessary, both because he was getting
    older and because he had somehow developed sufficient empathy for his victims
    to render the drugs unnecessary. He was not willing to take the medication.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Pallandi made it clear that, absent the implementation of any of the
    conditions in the proposed management program, he regarded the appellant as
    posing an unacceptable risk in the community “at any near point in the future”.
    A willingness to take the proper medication was one of those conditions.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reading
    the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, it is clear that she accepted Dr.
    Pallandi’s opinion. Absent a commitment to taking the required medication, the
    appellant clearly posed a future risk to the safety of the public.</p>
  <h4>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge deny the appellant procedural fairness?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their written submissions filed with the trial judge (there was no oral
    argument), counsel for the Crown and defence both referred to a requirement in
    the prior legislation. That provision required that an indeterminate sentence
    be imposed only where there was no “reasonable possibility of eventual control
    of the risk in the community”. In fact, the amendments proclaimed in 2008
    applied in this proceeding. Under the amendments, an indeterminate sentence was
    to be imposed unless there was “a reasonable expectation” that a lesser
    sentence would adequately protect the public.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons, the trial judge referred to counsel’s reliance on the prior
    legislation and went on, however, to address the evidence based on the
    applicable legislation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge, once she realized that counsel’s
    submissions were directed at the prior, rather than the applicable legislation,
    should have given counsel an opportunity to make further submissions directed
    at the applicable legislation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the trial judge could have followed that course. However, we do not
    see how the appellant was prejudiced. There is no suggestion in the arguments
    before us that the evidence would have been any different. Counsel had a full
    opportunity to frame his arguments in the context of the present legislation in
    this court. It does not appear to us that the different language in the two
    versions of the legislation would, in the circumstances of this case, have made
    any difference in the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellant or the
    arguments put forward for him. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons also offer an explanation for the trial judge’s failure
    to afford counsel an opportunity to make further submissions. The trial judge
    was satisfied, based on Dr. Pallandi’s report, that the appellant could not
    pass the “reasonable possibility of eventual control” test set out in the
    previous legislation. It followed from that, and the trial judge so found, that
    he must also fail the arguably more strenuous “reasonable expectation” test in
    the present legislation. There was, therefore, no need to request further
    submissions from counsel.</p>
  <h4>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did the trial judge erroneously place the onus on the appellant?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The trial judge, not surprisingly, given the language of s.
    753(4.1), indicated that there was a presumption in favour of an indeterminate
    sentence, unless the court was satisfied that there was a reasonable
    expectation that some lesser measure would adequately protect the public. <em>Boutilier</em>,
    decided after the trial judge released her reasons, makes it clear that there
    is no presumption: <em>Boutilier</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, at
    para. 71.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s single reference to a “presumption” caused no substantial wrong
    or miscarriage of justice. This case did not turn on any presumption. The
    outcome turned on the trial judge’s detailed findings of fact and the
    application of the proper burden of proof to those findings. </p>
  <h4>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the imposition of an indeterminate sentence unreasonable?</h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons accurately set out the factual background and the
    applicable legislation. Her analytical route to an indeterminate sentence is
    crystal clear and free of any legal error. Nor is her conclusion outside of the
    range of reasonable results on this record. To the contrary, an indeterminate
    sentence seems the necessary result, given the appellant’s refusal to take the
    medication necessary to render the risk posed by his continued presence in the
    community acceptable. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated at the conclusion of oral argument, the appeal is dismissed. </p>
