  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Jamal J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Introduction</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal involves a claim for actionable
    encroachment on an easement. The appellants, Michael Sullivan and Margaret Di
    Pede, built a swimming pool and surrounding deck, platform, and other elements
    (“Pool Amenities”) behind their house in Oakville. The Pool Amenities extend over
    a ten-foot strip of land which, although owned by the appellants, is subject to
    an easement held by the respondents, The Corporation of the Town of Oakville
    (“Town”) and Oakville Hydro Electricity Distribution Inc. (“Hydro”). The easement
    prohibits “the erection of any building or structure” within that strip of land.
    The appellants knew about the easement when they bought the property and proceeded
    to build the Pool Amenities without a municipal building permit.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge declared the Pool
    Amenities to be a “building or structure” erected on the land that was subject
    to the easement, and thus an actionable encroachment upon it. He ordered the appellants
    to remove the Pool Amenities and remediate any damage to the easement by June
    1, 2020. The appellants now appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In June 1972, the appellants’ predecessors in
    title granted an easement to the Town over “the most westerly ten feet (10’)” of
    their property. The easement indenture, which is registered on title, provides in
    relevant part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>WHEREAS the Owners are the owners of the lands
    described in Schedule “A” <span style='color:black'>hereto </span>and have
    agreed to grant the herein mentioned easements;</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>NOW THEREFORE the Owners in consideration of
    other good and valuable consideration and the sum of Two Dollars ($2.00) now
    paid to it by the Town, <span style='color:black'>hereby </span>grants to the
    Town the right, liberty and privilege appurtenant to its undertaking as a
    Municipal Corporation to construct, operate, maintain, replace and repair
    underground sewers, drains, pipes, conduits, wires and services generally with
    such above ground accesses, manholes, catch basins, hydrants, service boxes and
    other appurtenances as it desires, at its expense and for so long as it
    desires, upon, across, along and under the land described in Schedule “A” <span
style='color:black'>hereto </span>and for every such purpose the Town and those
    claiming under it shall have access to the said land <span style='color:black'>at
    all times </span>but <u>reserving to the Owners the right to use the surface of
    the said land for any purpose which does not conflict with the Town’s rights <span
style='color:black'>hereunder </span>and specifically excluding the planting of
    any tree and the erection of any building or structure</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In February 2000, the Town sold the easement to
    Hydro but retained an interest in it under the municipal by-law authorizing the
    sale.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In October 2012, the appellants bought the
    property. They knew about the easement before closing, but believed it was abandoned
    or never used. In fact, located within the easement is an underground conduit
    that houses a hydro cable providing electricity to a neighbouring property.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In early 2014, the appellants built the Pool
    Amenities in their back yard within the easement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is not disputed that the Pool Amenities are a
    “building” under the Ontario <em>Building Code Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c.
    23, and thus legally required a municipal building permit. No such permit was
    obtained. In January 2018, the appellant Michael Sullivan pleaded guilty to
    building the Pool Amenities without a building permit and breaching an order to
    comply. Mr. Sullivan offered to pay to relocate the hydro service of the
    neighbouring property, but his affected neighbour was unwilling to agree to
    this proposal.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It is also not disputed that, over the years, several
    other structures have been erected within the easement with the Town’s approval,
    including a carport and part of the house. Two large trees are also within the
    easement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2018, the respondents applied to the
    Ontario Superior Court for a declaration that the Pool Amenities encroach upon
    the easement and for an order requiring their removal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s decision</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>By order dated March 6, 2020, the application
    judge granted the application. In his reasons, he ruled that the Pool Amenities
    actionably encroach upon the easement because they contravene the express
    prohibition against erecting a building or structure within it. He also ruled
    that the equitable doctrine of proprietary estoppel does not prevent the Town
    and Hydro from enforcing their rights under the easement. He therefore ordered
    the appellants to remove the Pool Amenities and to remediate any damage to the
    easement at their own expense by June 1, 2020.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>obiter dicta</em>, however, the application
    judge added that had he not concluded that the Pool Amenities contravened the
    express terms of the easement, he would have ruled that the Town and Hydro had
    not established an actionable encroachment. He was “prepared to accept that the
    Pool Amenities could cause some unspecified or unknown, but probably quite
    minor, degree of inconvenience to the Town and/or Hydro in exercising their
    Easement rights, however, that is not the test for substantial interference.”</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Issues</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal raises three issues:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Is there an actionable encroachment on the easement?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Was the easement abandoned or partially
    extinguished?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Does the equitable doctrine of proprietary
    estoppel preclude enforcement of the easement?</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Discussion</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Issue #1: Is there an actionable encroachment
    on the easement?</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Applicable principles</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>In evaluating whether there is an actionable
    encroachment on an easement created by express grant, the court first determines
    the nature and extent of the easement by interpreting “the wording of the
    instrument creating the easement, considered in the context of the
    circumstances that existed when the easement was created”: <em>Fallowfield v.
    Bourgault</em> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), at para. 10; see also <em>Raimondi
    v. Ontario Heritage Trust</em>, 2018 ONCA 750, 96 R.P.R. (5th) 175, at para.
    11.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Once the nature and extent of the easement have been
    determined, the court then considers whether there is an actionable
    encroachment upon it. The test for an actionable encroachment is whether there is
    a “substantial interference” with the use and enjoyment of the easement for the
    purpose identified in the grant: <em>Weidelich v. de Koning</em>, 2014 ONCA
    736, 122 O.R. (3d) 545, at paras. 9-11; <em>Fallowfield</em>, at paras. 40-41; <em>Hunsinger
    v. Carter</em>, 2018 ONCA 656, 91 R.P.R. (5th) 175, at para. 11; Anne Warner La
    Forest, <em>Anger &amp; Honsberger, Law of Real Property</em>, loose-leaf, 3rd
    ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2019), </span><span lang=EN-CA>at para. </span><span

  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Application to this case</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants assert that the application judge
    erred in ruling that the Pool Amenities are an actionable encroachment, for two
    reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The easement does not limit the appellants’ right to build the Pool
    Amenities on their property, because the easement was only ever intended to be
    used, and has only ever been used, for a hydro line, which can be serviced even
    with the Pool Amenities located within the easement; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The application judge applied the wrong test for actionable
    encroachment by ruling that the appellants are “prohibited outright from
    erecting any building or structure within the Easement, regardless of whether
    that building or structure conflicted or substantially interfered with the
    rights of the Easement holder(s).” Had the application judge applied the
    correct “substantial interference” test, he would have concluded that no actionable
    encroachment was established.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept these submissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, the application judge’s ruling as to the nature

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view, the application judge properly
    focused on the wording of the easement indenture. The indenture states that the
    appellants’ rights to use the surface of the lands within the easement
    “specifically exclud[es] the planting of any tree and the erection of any
    building or structure”. He was entitled to conclude that the easement “delivered
    a two-part message to the homeowner”: “(i) do not use the surface of the
    Easement land for any purpose that conflicts with the Town’s rights (described
    above), <u>and</u> (ii) so that there is no confusion, do not under any
    circumstances plant a tree or erect a building or structure within the Easement”
    (emphasis in original). The bottom line, the application judge stated, is that
    “the planting of a tree or the erection of a building or structure on the
    Easement land is not permitted, period.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge was also entitled to
    conclude that interpreting the easement as an outright prohibition reflects its
    broad purpose of allowing the Town unfettered access within the easement to
    provide municipal services:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>One must remember that </span><span
lang=EN-CA>the purpose of this <span style='color:black'>particular </span>Easement
    is very broad. The Town, from the outset of the Indenture’s creation, has the
    right to (i) go underground within the Easement for, effectively, any reason
    connected to municipal services and to (ii) access, above ground and within the
    Easement, any item related to such a service. An outright prohibition against
    the planting/erection of any tree, building or structure within the Easement <span
style='color:black'>is neatly consistent with </span>such a broad purpose.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellants say that the application judge’s interpretation
    focuses principally on the wording of the indenture and ignores contemporaneous
    extrinsic evidence that suggests that the easement was primarily if not
    exclusively intended to permit a hydro line under the appellants’ property.
    They say that modern technology now allows the hydro line to be repaired or
    replaced even if a building or structure is erected within the easement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not accept this submission. It is, in
    effect, an invitation for the court to read down the clear words of the
    easement indenture based on the surrounding circumstances and the use made of
    the easement to date. But, as Rothstein J. for the Supreme Court of Canada cautioned
    in <em>Sattva</em>, “[w]hile the surrounding circumstances will be considered
    in interpreting the terms of a contract, they must never be allowed to
    overwhelm the words of that agreement”: at para. 57. The easement indenture here
    is not limited to placing a hydro line under the appellants’ property. It also
    allows the Town to install and maintain “underground sewers, drains, pipes,
    conduits, wires and services generally”. That these facilities have not been
    installed within the easement to date is of no moment. The easement is not time
    limited and is therefore perpetual: <em>Remicorp Industries Inc. v. Metrolinx</em>,
    2017 ONCA 443, 138 O.R. (3d) 109, at para. 47, citing <em>Gale on Easements</em>,
    20th ed. (London: Thomson Reuters (Professional) UK Limited, 2017), at para.
    12-26. Indeed, the easement indenture expressly permits the Town access to
    provide the other listed municipal services, “as it desires” and “for so long
    as it desires”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Thus, in my view, the application judge’s determination
    of the nature and extent of the easement is not tainted by palpable or overriding
    error. I would therefore reject the appellants’ first argument that the
    easement does not prohibit the erection of a building or structure such as the
    Pool Amenities.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Second, I disagree with the appellants’ claim that
    the application judge applied the wrong test for an actionable encroachment. Although
    I accept that the application judge’s reasons could have been clearer, I read those
    reasons as implicitly applying the substantial interference test. By contravening
    the outright prohibition against erecting a building or structure, the Pool
    Amenities necessarily encroach upon the easement. The easement indenture does
    not say that the appellants are prohibited from erecting a building or
    structure unless it creates a barrier or obstacle to the respondents’ exercise of
    their rights under the easement. Rather, as the application judge held, the
    appellants are “prohibited outright from erecting any business or structure
    within the Easement”. By agreeing to an outright prohibition, without
    qualification, the parties have effectively defined for themselves what will
    constitute a substantial interference with the easement.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The application judge’s observation in the
    alternative and in <em>obiter</em> that the respondents did not discharge their
    onus of establishing substantial interference does not detract from this
    conclusion. His <em>obiter</em> observation considered only one aspect of the
    easement — the appellants’ obligation not to use the surface of the easement
    for any purpose that conflicts with the Town’s rights. Because it was in the
    alternative, it did not consider the outright prohibition against erecting any
    building or structure. But when the outright prohibition is considered, as it
    was under the first part of the application judge’s analysis, a substantial
    interference is established.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I therefore see no basis to intervene with the
    application judge’s conclusion that the Pool Amenities are an actionable
    encroachment on the easement.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Issue #2: Was the easement abandoned or partially
    extinguished?</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Applicable principles</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>Remicorp</em>, this court reviewed the
    general principles relating to abandonment of an easement by release (at paras.
    47-51) and partial extinguishment of an easement (at paras. 63-73). In broad
    outline:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>“Unless an easement is granted for a term of
    years, the rights conferred by an easement are perpetual and, accordingly, are actually
    or potentially valuable rights. Therefore it is not lightly to be inferred that
    the owner of such a right should give it up for no consideration”: at para. 47,
    citing <em>Gale on Easements</em>, at para. 12-26.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Other than by an express release, an easement
    can be abandoned by release impliedly by non-use coupled with evidence of an
    intention to abandon the easement: at para. 49.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>An easement can be extinguished either by
    statute or at common law: at paras. 70-71.</span></p>
  <h5><span lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Application to this case</span></h5>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, in the alternative, the appellants assert that
    the easement has been abandoned for any purpose other than the hydro cable.
    They say this is the only purpose for which the easement has been used, and that
    modern technology allows the cable to be serviced effectively even with the Pool
    Amenities within the easement. They also suggest the easement has been partially
    extinguished at common law because the easement serves no purpose other than
    servicing the hydro cable.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the application judge made no express findings
    on abandonment or partial extinguishment, and it is not clear whether these
    issues were even argued before him. This court will generally not entertain entirely
    new issues on appeal where doing so might unfairly deprive the other party of
    the opportunity to lead relevant evidence: <em>Kaiman v. Graham</em>, 2009 ONCA
    77, 245 O.A.C. 130, at para. 18; <em>Whitby (Town) v. G &amp; G 878996 LM Ltd.</em>,
    2020 ONCA 654, 5 M.P.L.R. (6th) 174, at para. 9.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In any event, based on the evidence before the
    court and the findings that were made, I see no basis to conclude that the easement
    was abandoned or partially extinguished:</span></p>

    grant registered on title and its use continuously for a hydro cable is
    sufficient to find that the respondents did not intend to abandon it: see </span><em>Remicorp</em><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    induced, encouraged, or allowed them to believe that the easement was abandoned
