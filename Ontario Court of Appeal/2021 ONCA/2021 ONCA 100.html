lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A pre-enquete was scheduled to determine whether

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant prepared a detailed memorandum to
    support his case for the issuance of process at the conclusion of the

    also appeared at the pre-enquete. Before the justice of the peace heard the
    allegations of the appellant or the evidence of any witnesses, Crown counsel
    directed the clerk of the court to enter a stay of proceedings on the
    information laid by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Background Facts</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issues raised on appeal do not require any
    elaboration of the circumstances underlying the offences the appellant alleges
    his ex-wife committed. A brief summary of the procedural history of the case
    will suffice.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Information</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On March 27, 2018 the appellant laid an
    information before a justice of the peace. The appellant alleged that his
    ex-wife, from whom he separated in 2001, had committed three indictable
    offences in the State of Florida and this province at various periods between
    2014 and 2016.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Preparation for the Pre-enquete </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant retained counsel to assist him in
    presenting his case for the issuance of process on the information. Counsel
    provided the local Crown with a copy of the materials on which the appellant
    relied and responded to questions asked and concerns expressed by the Crown
    about the manner in which the appellant proposed to prove the abduction allegation.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Pre-enquete</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>About six weeks after a justice of the peace
    received the information laid by the appellant, the pre-enquete was commenced
    before a designated justice of the peace.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the outset of the pre-enquete, before the
    justice of the peace heard the allegations of the appellant or the evidence of
    any witnesses, Crown counsel directed the clerk of the court to enter a stay of
    proceedings on the information under s. 579(1) of the <em>Criminal Code of
    Canada</em>. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Crown counsel explained his reasons for
    directing entry of the stay. The allegation of abduction was legally
    unsustainable in view of the litigation history between the appellant and his
    ex-wife. The count of disobeying a court order under s. 127 of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em> could not be established because “other legislation expressly
    provides another punishment or mode of proceeding” thus barring conviction
    under the section. And there was no reasonable prospect of conviction on the
    count alleging perjury.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, Crown counsel explained that an
    essential witness on all counts, the appellant and accused’s daughter, would
    likely suffer “significant trauma” if required to testify. There was a lengthy
    history of parental conflict to such an extent that she obtained a court order
    permitting her to withdraw from parental control.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The justice of the peace did not conduct the
    pre-enquete once Crown counsel had directed entry of the stay of proceedings. No
    process issued.</span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Notice of Application</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Assisted by counsel, the appellant applied to
    the Superior Court of Justice for an order setting aside the stay of
    proceedings and directing the conduct of the pre-enquete. The appellant alleged
    that entry of the stay was not authorized by s. 579(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, constituted a breach of his rights under s. 7 of
    the </span></em><em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, and was an abuse of process. The remedial
    provisions mobilized in support of the application included ss. 24(1) of the </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, ss. 52(1) of the </span></em><em>Constitution Act,
    1982</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em>and the extraordinary
    remedy of <em>mandamus</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown opposed the application and
    sought its summary dismissal under Rule 34.02 of the <em>CPR</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. </span></em></span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Decision of the Motion Judge </span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge heard submissions on whether
    the appellant’s application should be dismissed without a hearing under Rule
    34.02. After reserving his decision, he released written reasons dismissing the
    appellant’s application on the basis that it had no reasonable prospect of
    success. In doing so, he invoked Rule 34.02.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge was satisfied that the standard
    to be applied on the Crown’s application under Rule 34.02 is “a high one”. He
    accepted that the direction that a stay be entered was part of the core
    discretion of the Crown. The exercise of this discretion was reviewable only on
    the ground of flagrant impropriety in its exercise. In this case, the motion
    judge observed, the Crown had provided detailed reasons for directing entry of
    the stay. The proposed prosecution was not in the public interest and there was
    no reasonable prospect of conviction on any of the proposed counts.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the result, the motion judge was satisfied
    that there was no reasonable prospect that the appellant’s application could
    succeed. Rule 34.02 was engaged and the appellant’s application was dismissed
    without a hearing.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>The Grounds of Appeal </span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant takes issue with the decision of
    the motion judge. He says that the motion judge erred:</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>in invoking Rule 34.02 to dismiss his
    application to set aside the stay and order the conduct of the pre-enquete; and</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>in failing to hold that the Crown had no authority to enter a stay
    under s. 579(1) before hearing the allegations of the appellant and the
    evidence of witnesses because there was no “accused” and proceedings had not
    been “commenced” as required by s. 579(1). </span></p>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>Ground #1: The Applicability of Rule 34.02</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA>The specific focus of this ground of appeal
    is the applicability of Rule 34.02 of the <em>CPR</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. However, the standard set out in that rule, “there
    is no reasonable prospect that the application can succeed”, requires
    consideration of the merits of the substantive errors alleged in the
    interpretation of s. 579(1) </span></em>of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em></span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Arguments on Appeal</span></h3>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Appellant’s position</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant contends that the motion judge properly
    stated, but erred in applying, Rule 34.02. The rule sets a rigorous standard.
    Much like a motion to strike a claim in civil proceedings, Rule 34.02 is a tool
    that must be used with care. If there is a reasonable prospect that an
    application will succeed, the rule should not be invoked. The approach should
    be generous and err on the side of permitting a novel, but arguable,
    application to proceed.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In this case, the prevailing jurisprudence has
    failed to correctly interpret the scope of the Crown’s authority to direct a
    stay of proceedings under s. 579(1) at the pre-enquete. A hearing on the merits
    is required to resolve this issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that at the outset of a
    pre-enquete, before the allegations of the informant and the evidence of
    witnesses have been heard, the Crown cannot, as it did here, enter a stay of
    proceedings. Until a determination to issue process has been made, there is no
    “accused”, and proceedings have not “commenced”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In addition, the motion judge applied the wrong
    test in failing to set aside the stay. The standard for a court to overturn the
    Crown’s exercise of discretion is not “flagrant impropriety”, rather it is less
    demanding.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>The Respondent’s position</span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent contends that the motion judge
    properly invoked Rule 34.02 to dismiss the appellant’s application to set aside
    the stay and direct that a pre-enquete be held. This result could equally have

    that the Crown could not direct entry of the stay before the justice had
    conducted the pre-enquete and had decided to issue process. This is because of
    the wording of s. 579(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> and the provisions of s. 11(d) of the </span></em><em>Crown
    Attorneys Act, </em>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.49. This same argument <em><span

    the Crown to direct entry of a stay of proceedings under s. 579(1), the respondent
    contends, is a core element in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is
    equally so whether its entry is in a public or private prosecution. Entry of a
    stay has to do with a decision about whether a prosecution will proceed or
    continue, against whom, and on what charge. This decision occupies the core of
    the sovereign authority peculiar to the office of the Attorney General.</span></em></p>

    core of prosecutorial discretion, the courts cannot interfere except in
    circumstances of flagrant impropriety amounting to an abuse of process. This
    requires evidence that the Crown’s conduct is so egregious that it undermines
    the integrity of the judicial process or results in trial unfairness. As for
    example, where it is the product of improper motive or grounded in bad faith.</span></em></p>

    the respondent says, the appellant has failed to provide any evidentiary
    foundation to put into play an arguable case of abuse of process. That the
    appellant disagrees with the decision of Crown counsel to direct entry of a stay
    moves no freight. The presumption that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion
    was </span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA>bona fide</span></em><em><span lang=EN-CA

    decision under review. Others are concerned with the scope of s. 579(1) of the <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, in particular, with the temporal limits on its exercise. The
    remainder relate to the reviewability of stay decisions made by the Crown.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-CA>Rule 34.02 </span></h4>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    Other Applications</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> is
    contained in Part III, <em>Trial Proceedings and Evidence</em>, of the <em>CPR</em>.
    Under Rule 34.02, the presiding judge may conduct a preliminary assessment of
    the merits of any pre-trial or other application. The assessment is based on
    the materials filed on the application. If the judge is satisfied on the basis
    of those materials that there is no reasonable prospect of success, the judge
    may dismiss the application without further hearing and inquiry.</span></p>

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The presiding judge may conduct a preliminary
    assessment of the merits of any pre-trial or other application on the basis of

    fair litigation. It promotes two goals: efficiency and correct results.
    Dismissing applications that have no reasonable prospect of success unclutters
    the proceedings, weeds out the hopeless, and draws the attention of the decision-makers
    where it should be – ensuring that those with a reasonable prospect of success
    proceed to adjudication on their merits: <em>R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd</em>.,

    involved where </span></em><span lang=EN-CA>Rule 34.02 is invoked is informal,
    else it become antithetical to its purpose. When summary dismissal is sought,
    the affected party should put its best foot forward. The standard to be met by
    the party invoking the rule is demanding. This necessarily follows from the language
    “no reasonable prospect that the application could succeed”: <em>R. v.

  <h3><span lang=EN-CA>The Principles Applied</span></h3>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I would not give effect to this ground of

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To begin, I am satisfied that what the Crown
    sought in response to the appellant’s motion to quash the stay and order the
    conduct of the pre-enquete fell within the sweep of Rule 34.02. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-style:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><span lang=EN-CA> Among the jurisdictional sources invoked
    by the appellant was the authority of a judge of the superior court of criminal
    jurisdiction to grant orders in lieu of the prerogative writs of <em>certiorari</em> (to quash the stay as entered without jurisdiction) and <em>mandamus</em> (to
    compel the conduct of the pre-enquete). These remedies are available on
    applications under Rule 43 of the <em>CPR</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>.</span></em></span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s response to the appellant’s
    application was to seek its summary dismissal under Rule 34.02. The judge who
    heard the Crown’s application was the motion judge on the appellant’s
    application, thus “the presiding judge” for the purposes of Rule 34.02.
    Accordingly, the summary dismissal authority was available to the motion judge
    in connection with the appellant’s original application which was an “other
    application” for the purposes of the rule. The remedy afforded by Rule 34.02 –
    summary dismissal – could be granted if, but only if, the Crown met the
    standard required on the basis of the materials filed on the original motion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although Rule 34.02 appears in Part III of the <em>CPR</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, </span></em><em>Trial Procedure and Evidence</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, its language signals a broader application. This is
    consistent with the terms “other application” in the </span></em>Rule. The term
    “application” is exhaustively defined in Rule 1.03 as “a proceeding commenced
    by notice of application in Form 1”. It is of no moment whether the enabling
    legislation or other authority describes the proceedings as an application or a
    motion. The term “proceeding” includes an application or other hearing.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This construction of Rule 34.02 is also in

    jurisprudence advocating use of the case or trial management power to weed out
    unmeritorious claims by summary process: see, <em>Cody</em><em><span

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant’s application, reduced to its
    essentials, sought two orders. He asked that the stay directed by the Crown be

    contained in the information.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>To set aside the stay, the appellant argued that
    s. 579(1) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> </span></em>does
    not permit entry of a stay at the direction of the Crown before a determination
    has been made at the conclusion of the pre-enquete that process should issue.
    Amongst other things, this is because there is no “accused” until that time and
    proceedings have not been “commenced”.</span></p>
