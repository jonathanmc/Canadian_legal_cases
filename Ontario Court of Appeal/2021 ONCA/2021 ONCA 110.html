  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent was charged with one count each of
    sexual assault and sexual interference. There were two main questions at trial:
    (a) did the appellant prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did
    not consent to the sexual activity; and, if so, (b) did the respondent have an
    honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent? </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge answered the first question in
    the affirmative, concluding that the complainant did not consent to the sexual
    activity in question. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then went on to consider the
    second question, whether the respondent had an honest but mistaken belief in
    communicated consent at the time that the sexual activity took place. On this
    point, the trial judge concluded that she could not “reject his defence of
    honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent” and, therefore, entered
    acquittals on both counts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals to this court on the basis
    that the trial judge erred in her analytical approach to the defence of honest
    but mistaken belief in communicated consent. Specifically, the appellant argues
    that the trial judge failed to consider a statutory prerequisite to the
    availability of that defence, which is the need for the respondent to have
    taken “reasonable steps” in ascertaining the complainant’s consent: <em>Criminal
    Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 273.2(b). The absence of any reasoning on
    this point is said to lead to inadequate reasons that do not give full effect
    to the relevant provisions of the <em>Criminal Code</em>: see <em>R. v. Gagnon</em>,
    2018 CMAC 1, 427 D.L.R. (4th) 430, at paras. 36, 44-45, aff’d 2018 SCC 41, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>[2018] 3 S.C.R. 3</span><span lang=EN-CA>. Hence, such a failure to
    consider s. 273.2(b) of the <em>Criminal Code</em><i> </i>is a reversible error.
    We agree. Therefore, we allow the appeal, set aside the acquittals, and order a
    new trial on both counts. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Brief Factual Background</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant was 15 and the respondent was 18
    at the time of the alleged offences. They knew one another because the
    complainant would sometimes buy cannabis from the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The complainant appears to have been
    experiencing difficult life circumstances in and around the time of the alleged
    offences. She had moved away from her parental home and was living at a
    friend’s place in the months preceding the alleged offences. One evening, she
    decided to go out with the respondent and two of his friends. The police
    stopped the group at around 2:47 a.m. The complainant testified that she was
    asked by the respondent to take a Xanax pill so that the police would not catch
    the respondent in possession of the pill. As it was dark at the time, the
    complainant was unsure as to whether it was a full-sized pill. At this time, the
    police arrested one of the friends for breach of probation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Eventually, the complainant and the respondent
    ended up at the home of the remaining friend. The three individuals were all in
    the basement of that home together. The friend soon fell asleep in his bed.
    While the complainant and respondent were initially on two separate couches, the
    respondent motioned to her to come to the larger couch where he was laying down
    with the only blanket in the room. She was cold and decided to accompany him on
    that couch. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>From here, the complainant’s and the
    respondent’s evidence diverged at trial. The complainant acknowledged that she initially
    moved close to him and rubbed against him. He was aroused. She said that the
    respondent started to digitally penetrate her. He pulled her pants down. She
    attempted to get off of the couch, but she tripped. The respondent pulled her
    back onto the couch, held her closer to him, and then, as she put it, “He
    started having sex with me and I said no.” When she realized he was not going
    to stop, she said that “we should put a condom on and he told me that that was
    childish of me, and then he continued until he was done and then he rolled over
    and that was that.” The complainant said that the respondent withdrew his penis
    just prior to ejaculation, leaving ejaculate on and around her vagina. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent testified that it was the
    complainant who initiated the sexual contact. According to the respondent, he
    got aroused when the complainant started rubbing against him. He testified that
    he asked her if she wanted to “fuck”, and she said “yes, do you have a condom?”
    His evidence on this point was as follows: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>I asked her if she wanted to fuck, and she
    says yes, do you have a condom? And so I said no, those are for children. I was
    trying to blow off the fact that I didn’t really have a condom on me and we
    were – so just the bum grinding still keeps happening and I end up start
    pulling down the right side of her leggings, and she ends up lifting the left
    side of her hip to get down the left side of her pants with me to help. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[S]he had to sit up and like perk her hip up,
    and then pull down the left side to help me get it down. They were leggings, so
    they were quite tight. And – yeah so just after that we had sex, it didn’t last
    very long[.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When asked what his understanding was with
    respect to whether the complainant was consenting to this sexual activity, the
    respondent answered: “For the most part, I knew she said yes. However, she
    never made it, she never said no, she never showed me that she didn’t want any
    sex or anything, she said yes and continued giving me signs that like there was
    – this is okay.” On the issue of the condom, the respondent acknowledged the
    following later in his evidence: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[S]he never told me no we’re not having sex if
    you don’t have a condom. She said yes – yes do you have a condom, I said no,
    those are for children and we continued to fool around on the couch. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Trial Judge’s Failure to Address
    Reasonable Steps</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge correctly resolved the issue of
    the absence of the complainant’s consent for the purposes of the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>of the offences. Here, the trial judge adverted to the need to focus upon
    the complainant’s subjective state of mind. Ultimately, the trial judge
    concluded that she was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant
    did not consent to the sexual activity. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge then moved on to consider the only
    other triable issue: “This leaves the final question, is there an air of
    reality to the defence of honest but mistaken belief in communicated consent,
    and if so, does it raise a reasonable doubt?” Unfortunately, the trial judge’s
    reasons are wanting in relation to this issue. </span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Section 273.2 of the <em>Criminal Code</em> places important limits on the defence of honest but mistaken belief in
    communicated consent, including s. 273.2(b), which states “</span><span
lang=EN-CA>[</span><span lang=EN-CA>i</span><span lang=EN-CA>]</span><span
lang=EN-CA>t is not a defence” where “the accused did not take reasonable
    steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that
    the complainant was consenting”. As Moldaver J. held in <em>R. v. Barton</em>,<i> </i>2019 SCC 33, 376 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at para. 104, s. 273.2(b) “imposes a <span
class=Underline>precondition</span> to the defence of honest but mistaken
    belief in communicated consent – no reasonable steps, no defence” (emphasis
    added). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>There are both objective and subjective
    dimensions to this defence. The accused must take steps that are objectively
    reasonable in the circumstances, and the reasonableness of the steps must be
    considered in light of the circumstances known to the accused at the time: <em>Barton</em>,<i> </i>at para. 104. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We agree with the appellant that this case required
    a clear inquiry into the reasonable steps potentially taken by the respondent.
    This is particularly true given both the complainant and respondent’s clear
    evidence that she asked for a condom, yet the sexual intercourse ensued without
    one. Even taking the respondent’s evidence at its highest, this is a
    circumstance that was known to him at the time that the intercourse commenced,
    yet he did not inquire of the complainant whether she wished to proceed without
    a condom. Instead, he chose to rely upon what he perceived from the
    complainant’s actions, as described by him: the continued physical grinding by
    the complainant; the movement of her hip; and her assistance with pulling down
    one side of her pants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge’s reasons are entirely silent as
    to whether the respondent took any objectively reasonable steps in light of the
    circumstances known to him at the time. Instead, the trial judge reviewed the
    evidence, made conclusions about what she could not reject, and then satisfied
    herself that it was impossible to reject the defence of honest but mistaken
    belief in communicated consent. The trial judge’s reasoning can be summarized
    as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)  She could not reject the respondent’s evidence that he asked
    the complainant if she “wanted to fuck” or the complainant’s evidence that she
    asked if he had a condom.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)  She was “not convinced by his evidence that [the complainant]
    actually said the word ‘yes’”, but could not reject the respondent’s evidence
    that when he “tried to brush off the fact that he did not have a condom”, the
    complainant continued to rub against his penis and “perked her hip up and
    pulled the right side of her pants.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On this basis, the trial judge concluded: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is impossible to reject his evidence that
    he honestly but mistakenly believed she was communicating her consent by her
    actions of rubbing against his penis, and then assisting him in the removal of
    her pants. I certainly accept his evidence that this only lasted a minute or
    two, and that it was bad sex. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote align=center style='text-align:center'><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[I]n the end, given the totality of the
    evidence, one cannot reject his defence of honest but mistaken belief in
    communicated consent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We cannot accept the respondent’s position that
    the reasonable steps inquiry is implicit in the trial judge’s reasoning set out
    above. To the contrary, the reasoning seems to focus exclusively upon why the
    respondent could be said to have honestly but mistakenly believed the
    complainant to be consenting. In our view, the trial judge’s reasons do not
    explicitly or implicitly address the prerequisite of reasonable steps. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The reasonable steps inquiry is a fact-specific
    one. Clearly, those steps cannot arise from the complainant’s silence,
    passivity, or ambiguous conduct: <em>R. v. Ewanchuk</em>, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>[1999] 1 S.C.R. 330,</span><i><span lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span
lang=EN-CA>at para. 51; <em>Barton</em>,<i> </i>at para. 107. Whether the
    complainant “perked” her hip or not, or helped with pulling down one side of
    her pants or not, is at best ambiguous conduct, particularly ambiguous as to
    what the complainant may or may not have been consenting to. This is especially
    true given the trial judge’s finding of fact that the complainant “asked if he
    had a condom.” In the circumstances of this case, failing to specifically address
    the prerequisite of reasonable steps, constitutes a reversible error. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Remedy</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant asks us to allow the appeal and,
    pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, enter convictions
    on both counts. While we agree that the acquittals must be set aside, we
    decline to enter convictions. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Although the appellant’s position has much
    force, the trial judge’s reasons are insufficiently clear to permit this court
    to confidently enter convictions. Among other issues, the reasons for judgment
    lack clarity on factual findings and are devoid of credibility assessments. For
    instance, it appears that the trial judge concluded that the <em>actus reus</em><i> </i>of the sexual assault was made out, not because she believed the
    complainant, but because of the respondent’s evidence, where he testified that
    “for the most part he knew she said yes”. Indeed, nowhere in the reasons does
    the trial judge articulate credibility findings with respect to either the complainant
    or respondent. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The combined absence of clear credibility and
    factual findings deprives this court of the type of clarity required when
    determining whether the respondent is, in fact, guilty. This task is better
    left to a new trial judge, who will be best positioned to make all requisite
    credibility and factual findings. </span></p>
