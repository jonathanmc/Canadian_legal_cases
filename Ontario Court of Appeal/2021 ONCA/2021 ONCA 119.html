  <p class=Judge><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Strathy C.J.O.:</span></strong></p>
  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>OVERVIEW</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This appeal concerns the application of “Step Six”
    in <em>R. v. Garofoli</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was arrested and charged with
    various firearms offences. At trial, the Crown’s case turned primarily on the
    handgun evidence that had been found by police during their execution of a
    search warrant on the appellant’s car. The warrants, one for the appellant’s
    car and one for a dwelling at 121 Dollery Court, were issued on the basis of an
    “Information to Obtain” (“ITO”) that relied heavily on the tips of a
    confidential informant (“CI”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant brought an application to
    challenge the validity of the warrants. He asserted that if the warrants were
    quashed, the resulting warrantless search of his car violated his rights under
    s. 8 of the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>, and that the
    handgun evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'>At the request of the
    Crown, the trial judge applied “Step Six” of </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Garofoli</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA style='line-height:200%'> and produced a judicial summary of the
    portions of the ITO that had been redacted in order to protect the CI’s
    identity. The trial judge determined that the redacted ITO and the judicial
    summary disclosed “reasonable grounds” for the warrants to be issued. The trial
    judge rejected the appellant’s application, upheld the warrants, and admitted
    the handgun evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After the ensuing trial, the trial judge
    convicted the appellant of all charges and imposed a global sentence of six
    years, less the credit for pre-sentence custody. The appellant has since served
    that sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant appeals his convictions on the
    ground that the trial judge erred in upholding the warrants. The appellant
    submits that: (a) the ITO did not meet the criteria set out in <em>R. v. Debot</em>,
    [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140; (b) the judicial summary was inadequate; and (c) the
    trial judge erred in relying on redacted information that he could not
    challenge. The appellant argues that if the warrants were erroneously
    authorized, the subsequent search of his car constituted a serious breach of
    his <em>Charter</em> rights, and that the admission of the handgun evidence
    would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. Because the handgun
    evidence was essential to the Crown’s case, the appellant requests that his
    convictions be set aside, and acquittals entered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>B.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>On June 13, 2011, Toronto police obtained two
    warrants under s. 487 of the <em>Criminal Code</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, to
    search a 1997 Acura motor vehicle that allegedly belonged to the appellant, and
    a residence at 121 Dollery Court.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The following day, at about 8:41 p.m., a police
    officer, conducting surveillance of the appellant, observed him walking to his car,
    which was parked at another location in Toronto. The officer noted that the
    appellant was “holding onto something underneath his shirt at waistband level …
    an object that appeared to have some weight.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The officer observed the appellant enter his car on the driver’s
    side, still holding onto the object. Once seated, the appellant reached over to
    the passenger-side airbag compartment, “manipulat[ed] something up in that
    area,” and closed the lid of the compartment by banging down on it with his
    fist. The officer then observed the appellant start his car and drive off.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Several police surveillance vehicles followed the appellant’s car,
    ultimately making the decision to stop it on Black Creek Drive in Toronto. They
    arrested the appellant, and searched his car pursuant to the warrant issued on
    the previous day. They found a loaded semi-automatic handgun in the
    passenger-side airbag compartment. They charged the appellant with various
    firearms offences.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>C.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>THE ITO and the judicial summary</span></h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As the ITO relied on information provided by a CI, it had been heavily
    redacted before its disclosure to the trial judge and defence counsel. The
    redacted ITO contained the following information about the appellant and his
    alleged offences:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In March 2011, the affiant of the ITO learned
    from the CI’s handler that a male by the name of Jeffrey Brown was “currently”
    in possession of a firearm and was dealing drugs. The CI described Mr. Brown as
    male, black, in his twenties, 5’7” in height, with a medium build. The CI
    disclosed that Mr. Brown owned a four-door green Acura and “hung out” in the
    Jane and Finch area.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The affiant confirmed through investigation that
    the appellant owned a 1997 four-door green Acura.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In April 2011, the affiant was informed that the
    appellant was receiving welfare cheques at 121 Dollery Court.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2011, police officers conducted
    surveillance at 121 Dollery Court on two occasions, and observed the appellant
    and his Acura vehicle at that location.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In May 2011, the affiant learned from the CI’s
    handler that Mr. Brown was still in the possession of a firearm.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The affiant conducted additional database searches,
    and he ascertained that the appellant was prohibited from the possession of firearms
    due to a conviction for first-degree murder; that the appellant had three
    convictions, including second-degree murder; and that both the appellant’s
    driver’s license and his Acura were registered to an address in Ajax.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The affiant discovered from reports in “Field
    Information cards” that the appellant had been investigated on three occasions
    between 2010 and 2011 in and around the Jane and Finch area. Those reports
    matched the CI’s description of Mr. Brown and his car.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown subsequently produced a second redacted version of the
    ITO, which disclosed portions that had previously been redacted. In particular,
    the new ITO revealed that, on a redacted date in June, the CI had told his
    handler that, “Jeffrey Brown has a gun on him.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The redacted ITO contained the following information about the CI:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    had been assigned a confidential source number.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    police in relation to drug trafficking, homicides, and shootings. The CI’s
    information had led to the seizure of firearms.</span></p>

  <p class=MsoListBullet2><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

    perjury-related offences.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The affiant stated that he had no reason to believe the CI’s tips
    about the appellant were false or malicious in nature.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown asked the trial judge to apply <em>Garofoli</em> “Step
    Six” and provided the judge with a summary of the information that had been
    redacted from the ITO. After reviewing the summary and the unredacted ITO, the
    trial judge approved the summary. That summary, in its entirety, read as
    follows:</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>After hearing the submissions of counsel, the trial judge reserved
    judgment. He subsequently dismissed the appellant’s application to quash the
    warrants and exclude the handgun evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge began his analysis by summarizing the jurisprudence
    on judicial review of an authorizing judge’s decision to grant a warrant. He correctly
    stated that the question before him was whether the search warrants, as
    amplified on review, could have been issued: <em>R. v. Grant</em>, [1993] 3
    S.C.R. 223, at p. 251, citing <em>Garofoli</em>, at p. 1452.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge appreciated that in a case involving a confidential
    informant, the sufficiency of the ITO must be assessed according to the three <em>Debot</em> factors: whether the tip is compelling, whether the CI is credible, and whether
    the tip has been confirmed by independent police investigation: <em>R. v. Rocha</em>,
    2012 ONCA 707, 112 O.R. (3d) 742, at para. 16, citing <em>Debot</em>, at p. 1168.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The trial judge determined that the redacted ITO contained “some
    information” on the credibility of the CI, but omitted details such as the CI’s
    criminal record. He noted that the ITO was sloppily drafted and used
    “remarkably similar” language to the phraseology this court criticized in <em>Rocha</em>.
    However, he found that there was “confirmatory evidence” of the CI’s tips in
    the form of police observations and street checks. Furthermore,</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Judicial Summary indicates that the
    Informant’s information is detailed and specific, the means of his knowledge is
    disclosed, the informant has been in the Applicant’s presence many times, and

    firearm.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

lang=EN-CA>The trial judge held that, based on the redacted ITO and the

    had been satisfied. In the alternative, he mentioned that if he had erred in

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the
    ITO satisfied the <em>Debot</em> criteria, in applying the <em>Garofoli</em> Step Six procedure, and in admitting the handgun evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>With respect to the <em>Debot</em> criteria, the appellant contends
    that the CI’s tips were neither credible nor corroborated. He argues that the
    ITO disclosed minimal information about the CI’s credibility in order to create
    a “veneer of honesty,” but failed to include essential details, such as the
    CI’s motive and full criminal record. The trial judge properly acknowledged
    these omissions, but failed to explain why he concluded that the CI was
    credible. The appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to conduct a
    meaningful analysis of whether the ITO was corroborated. Most of the
    “corroborative” information obtained by police investigation concerned commonplace
    details about the appellant, and the only other source relied upon by the
    affiant was a dated and unrelated youth criminal record. While the appellant
    also disputes the trial judge’s finding that the CI’s tips were compelling, he asserts
    that in the absence of credibility and corroboration, the ITO cannot stand.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant further submits that the trial judge erred in his
    application of <em>Garofoli</em> Step Six because the judicial summary did not
    provide a reasonable basis on which to challenge the ITO. Moreover, the trial
    judge based his decision to uphold the warrants on redacted information that
    had not been summarized.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant contests the Crown’s argument that if the ITO is quashed,
    the police had reasonable and probable grounds to carry out a warrantless
    arrest and a search incident to that arrest. The appellant maintains that the
    Crown did not adduce any evidence at trial as to whether the arresting officer
    had subjective grounds to justify a warrantless arrest, and that this court
    should not make that inference from the officer’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant consequently submits that the trial judge should have
    excluded the handgun evidence under s. 24(2) of the <em>Charter</em>. The
    affiant’s “sloppy” drafting of the ITO, with its omissions, exaggerations, and
    misleading statements, discussed below, pushed the <em>Charter</em> breach to
    the serious end of the spectrum. In addition, the impact on the appellant’s <em>Charter</em> rights was significant. The appellant claims that the public interest in
    prosecuting the case cannot “tip the balance” towards admission of the handgun
    evidence when the other two branches of the s. 24(2) test favour its exclusion.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that the trial judge’s decision is entitled to
    deference. While some of the appellant’s criticisms of the ITO may be fair, the
    Crown asserts that they do not undermine the basis for the issuance of the
    search warrants. The trial judge was aware of the need to balance the interest
    in protecting the CI’s identity with the appellant’s fair trial rights. The
    trial judge analyzed the <em>Debot</em> factors in that context, and found that
    the CI’s tips were credible, corroborated and compelling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits that the trial judge correctly applied <em>Garofoli</em> Step Six. He could not have allowed more information to be disclosed, either in
    the judicial summary or in the cross-examination of the affiant by defence
    counsel, without exposing the CI’s identity. When the judicial summary is read
    together with the redacted ITO, it demonstrates that the warrants <span

    Rouleau J.A. provided a detailed description of the <em>Garofoli</em> “Step
    Six” procedure. Step Six arises in the context of an accused’s challenge to a
    search warrant that is issued on the basis of a CI’s tips. In order to protect
    the CI’s identity, the ITO containing the CI’s tips is redacted before its
    disclosure to the accused. The ITO may consequently become incapable of
    supporting the warrant’s authorization. Step Six allows the Crown to rely on
    the unredacted ITO to defend the warrant’s validity. In so doing, Step Six
    attempts to address the underlying tensions between the court’s duty to protect
    the confidential communications of CIs and police officers, and the
    constitutional right of the accused to make full answer and defence.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>When Step Six is invoked, the trial judge provides defence counsel

    sufficient information to mount both a facial and sub-facial challenge to the
    ITO, and to question whether the affiant made full and frank disclosure
    regarding the reliability of the CI and of their tips: <em>Crevier</em>, at

lang=EN-CA>It is important to contextualize this case in the evolution of the <em>Garofoli</em> Step Six jurisprudence. This court’s judgment in <em>Rocha</em> was released
    more than a year after the ITO was sworn on June 13, 2011. Thus, while the
    trial judge had the benefit of <em>Rocha</em> when he heard the application in late
    2012 and early 2013, and when he issued his reasons on July 30, 2013, the
    affiant of the ITO did not have the benefit of <em>Rocha</em>’s guidance when
    he swore the ITO. Moreover, the development of the <em>Garofoli</em> jurisprudence
    was at a relatively early stage at the time the application was heard. As

lang=EN-CA>While the “three Cs” of <em>Debot</em> are to be considered
    together, I agree with the appellant that if the CI’s credibility is weak, it
    can impact the assessment of the other two factors. Evidence that appears to be
    compelling may be rendered less so if the credibility of the CI is weak. Corroboration
    of evidence of low credibility obviously carries less weight than corroboration
    of evidence of high credibility.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Typically, the authorizing justice will be concerned to know the
    CI’s criminal record, their track record in providing useful information to
    police, and whether they had a particular motive for providing the information
    to police.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Here, the appellant notes that the affiant did not disclose the full
    criminal record of the CI, or whether there were any outstanding charges, to
    the authorizing justice. The affiant simply stated that the CI had “no
    convictions, to date, for perjury related offences.” The affiant testified that
    at the time of drafting the ITO, it was not his practice to inquire about the
    CI’s criminal record, and that he obtained the information stated above from
    the CI’s handler. He candidly acknowledged, on cross-examination, that the
    language he had used to describe the CI’s criminal record was no longer part of
    the acceptable lexicon.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant argues that in light of <em>Rocha</em>, the affiant’s
    “odd language and omissions” with respect to the CI’s criminal record made the
    CI’s credibility weak. The appellant emphasizes that the Crown counsel at trial
    had conceded the ITO’s insufficient details, and that the trial judge had criticized
    the same in his decision. The appellant asserts that the trial judge failed to
    explain how he came to his conclusion about the CI’s credibility, and draws our
    attention to the affiant’s other omissions.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In particular, the appellant submits that the affiant failed to disclose
    any motive the CI might have had for assisting police, such as financial or
    other consideration, public spiritedness, or some form of <em>animus</em>.
    There was also no meaningful information as to the CI’s reliability, whether
    the CI had previously provided false or unreliable information, or whether the
    CI’s tips had led to convictions in the past.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The Crown acknowledges that there is some merit to the appellant’s
    submissions about the “embarrassing” shortcomings in the ITO. The language is
    “sloppy,” referring, for example, to the appellant having a previous conviction
    for first-degree murder when, in fact, he had been charged with first-degree
    murder, but convicted of second-degree murder. In addition, the Crown noted
    that the affiant’s failure to disclose the CI’s criminal record was
    inexcusable. However, unlike the trial Crown, the appeal Crown did not concede
    that the CI’s credibility was weak. He submitted that the trial judge was alive
    to all these shortcomings, and yet he made no finding that the affiant
    deliberately misled the authorizing justice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I am inclined to agree with the Crown’s position. The redacted ITO
    stated that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The [CI] has provided information to police in
    the past and has been assigned a confidential source number. There is no
    indication that the information provided would be false or malicious in nature <span
class=Underline>as the confidential source has been proven in the past to be
    reliable</span>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Moreover, the judicial summary disclosed that “the [CI] is a carded
    or registered informant of the Toronto Police Service”, and that “the
    information provided by the [CI] has lead [<em>sic</em>] to the seizure of
    several firearms.” The fact that the CI was formally registered on police records
    spoke to their reliability, as did the fact that the CI had previously provided
    information leading to the seizure of firearms – the very crime at issue here. While
    it would have been preferable for the affiant to have included information
    about the CI’s motive, it can be inferred that the CI had some motive for
    providing the information, although no motive for providing false or misleading
    information, and a history of providing reliable information.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In summary, while the trial judge did not thoroughly explain why he
    found the CI to be credible, and while there were some shortcomings in the
    affiant’s disclosure of the CI’s criminal record, track record, and motive,
    these were balanced by the CI’s history as a “registered” police informant with
    a record of providing reliable information that had led to the seizure of

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the police only corroborated the CI’s
    information in relation to “neutral” details that would have been known to
    anyone. Specifically, the police “corroborated”:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the colour and make of the appellant’s vehicle –
    a four-door green Acura;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the description of the appellant’s appearance –
    a black male in his twenties, 5’ 7” tall, medium build; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span lang=EN-CA style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>the fact that the appellant was a drug dealer
    and “hung out” in the Jane and Finch area of Toronto.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>I agree with the respondent that the corroborative effect of some of
    this information is minimal when viewed in isolation. However, the information
    cannot be viewed in isolation. When taken together, as it must be, the
    information of the CI was corroborated by the police’s independent inquiries. A
    police database check confirmed the appellant’s birth date, and the fact that
    he owned a four-door green Acura. The ITO also disclosed that the affiant had obtained
    police “Field Information cards,” indicating that the appellant had been
    observed on March 23, 2010, February 15, 2011, and April 2, 2011 in the Jane
    Street area. On one of those occasions, the appellant produced his driver’s
    licence as identification, and on two of those occasions, he was observed in the
    Acura registered under his name.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In addition, on two occasions in May 2011, police observed the
    appellant at 121 Dollery Court, the location where his welfare payments were
    sent. On the first occasion, May 17, he was observed leaving the dwelling,
    entering the Acura which was parked in the driveway, and driving away. On the
    second occasion, May 30, he was observed leaving the dwelling, walking up to
    the driver’s side of the vehicle, removing something from the front of the
    vehicle, placing it under his sweater, and returning to the dwelling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>As this court explained in <em>MacDonald</em>, at para. 20, police
    are “not obliged, before conducting the search, to confirm the very criminality
    alleged by the tipster.” There was, therefore, corroboration of the CI’s information
    on the appellant. The police confirmed the fact that the appellant drove a
    four-door green Acura, and that he “hung out” in the Jane and Finch area.
    Although the CI was not able to identify the appellant’s residence, police were
    able to corroborate the appellant’s ownership of the Acura and his connection
    to 121 Dollery Court, where they observed both the appellant and his Acura.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8><span lang=EN-CA style='text-decoration:none'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Was the CI’s information compelling?</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that he has limited ability to assess whether
    the CI’s information was compelling because the redactions were substantial,
    and the judicial summary was “thin.” He argues that, based on the information
    available to him, there was no compelling evidence to indicate that a firearm
    would be found in either the Acura or the residence at 121 Dollery Court at the
    time of the search. He relies on <em>Herta</em>, at para. 51, in which this
    court found that the CI’s statement that the accused “would not go anywhere
    without the gun” was not sufficiently compelling to justify a search at any
    location the accused had attended as “[t]his would have turned [the accused]
    into walking, ready-made grounds for belief.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>To assess whether the information was compelling, it is necessary to
    examine both the redacted ITO and the judicial summary. The summary indicates
    that the CI had been in the appellant’s presence “many times”; that the CI’s
    information about the firearm was “detailed and specific”; that the means of
    the CI’s knowledge was disclosed; and that the CI’s information was current. The
    summary also mentioned that the CI had advised his handler that “wherever
    Jeffrey Brown is, the firearm is.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>This information is compelling because it established that the CI
    was familiar with the appellant, that the CI’s observations were first-hand,
    and that the information was current. The CI was able to give a detailed and
    specific description of the firearm, which indicated that the CI had personally
    seen it. Furthermore, the appellant confirmed to the CI that he always had the
    firearm with him. Read together, the redacted ITO and the judicial summary established
    that the CI’s information was compelling.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>Despite the appellant’s submissions, I do not regard this as a case
    similar to <em>Herta</em>. In <em>Herta</em>, there was little information
    about the CI’s credibility, and the court found that corroboration was weak.
    The court rejected the proposition that if “a CI has seen someone with a gun at
    some point in the past, [it] means a search warrant can necessarily [be issued]
    for any place attended by that person in the future.” In this case, the CI’s similar
    statement was based not on speculation, but on what the appellant had said
    about his own possession of his weapon: effectively, “I carry it wherever I
    go.”</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>In conclusion, the trial judge was alive to the shortcomings in the
    ITO, and appropriately recognized that some of them were attributable to the lack
    of judicial guidance at the time of its preparation. The trial judge applied
    the <em>Debot</em> factors and did not find that the shortcomings reflected a
    deliberate attempt by the police to mislead the authorizing justice. The trial
    judge concluded that the information in the ITO was credible, compelling, and
    corroborated. The trial judge’s reasons demonstrate no misunderstanding of the
    evidence and no error of law. The trial judge’s decision is entitled to
    deference. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>The appellant submits that the trial judge committed two additional
    errors in applying <em>Garofoli</em> Step Six. First, the trial judge failed to
    appreciate that the judicial summary was inadequate; and second, the trial
    judge relied on information that was contained in the unredacted ITO and was
    not summarized. I do not accept either submission.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On the first point, I note that the appellant not only had the
    benefit of the judicial summary, but also of a cross-examination of the
    affiant, which was conducted with leave of the trial judge. More importantly,
    the judicial summary complied with the suggestions set out in <em>Crevier</em>.
    It described the <span class=Underline>nature</span> of the redacted
    information. The appellant, armed with the ITO, the judicial summary, and the
    cross-examination, had sufficient information to mount a facial or subfacial
    challenge to the ITO, and to argue that the requirements of <em>Debot</em> had
    not been met. That his challenge failed was not due to his inability to effectively
    challenge the ITO.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>On the second point, <em>Crevier</em>, at para. 90, states that “[t]o
    the extent that the accused is not sufficiently equipped to challenge certain
    redactions, the trial judge must not consider them.” The trial judge followed <em>Crevier</em> and made it clear that his reference to the unredacted ITO was an alternative
    in case he erred in his analysis of the <em>Debot</em> factors. As I would
    uphold his analysis on the <em>Debot</em> factors, I consider it unnecessary to
    address this submission.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>Although the trial judge suggested a “Step Seven” to <em>Garofoli</em>,
    which would permit an appellate court to review the unredacted ITO, I do not
    find it necessary to address that issue, and have not opened the sealed ITO
