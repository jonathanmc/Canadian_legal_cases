  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Overview</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant and complainant met through a
    dating website. After communicating online for a few days, they decided to meet
    up on May 21, 2016 and go for a walk. Following the walk, the complainant went
    to the appellant’s condominium. She had two glasses of wine. The complainant
    testified that, at some point, the intoxication “hit </span><span lang=EN-CA>[her]
    like a brick wall.”</span><span lang=EN-CA> She testified about a series of
    events that followed, including phases of paralysis where the complainant was
    unable to move while being attacked by the appellant. The attack was said to
    include both vaginal and anal intercourse, as well as choking. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At trial, the appellant maintained that the
    complainant consented to all sexual activity that night, arguing that she was
    lying about the lack of consent and the alleged choking. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant was charged with two counts: (1)
    sexual assault; and (2) choking to overcome resistance. The jury returned a
    verdict of guilty on the first count and not guilty on the second count. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This conviction appeal rests on three grounds: </span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(a) The trial judge did not properly relate the evidence to the sole
    issue to be decided – the complainant’s credibility – in the charge to the jury;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>(b) The two verdicts are inconsistent; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(c) The verdict of guilty on the sexual assault count is
    unreasonable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons that follow, the appeal is
    dismissed. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Charge to the Jury: Relating the Evidence
    to the Complainant’s Credibility </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant emphasizes that, as it related to
    the sexual assault count, the only issue to be decided at trial was the
    credibility of the complainant and the reliability of her evidence. As the
    Crown’s case rested largely on the complainant’s evidence, her credibility was
    key to the verdict. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, as the appellant points out, the
    complainant’s evidence was not without difficulties on the credibility front. For
    instance, she misled the police in the initial interview following the alleged
    events, claiming that she never mixed alcohol with her prescription drugs. She
    later testified at trial that she had consumed alcohol when taking prescription
    medication on several prior occasions. As well, the complainant testified to a
    state of inebriation that is said to have exceeded what her toxicology results
    were capable of supporting. Notably, the complainant’s evidence on this point
    is said to have been undermined by her own acknowledgement as to some of the
    actions she was capable of undertaking shortly after the alleged events, such
    as moving from one room to another. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A final example of the issues with the
    complainant’s credibility is with respect to her evidence that she screamed
    throughout the entire, lengthy encounter. The appellant points out that the
    complainant’s evidence on this point is highly if not completely suspect, given
    that multiple defence witnesses, who would have been in a position to hear that
    screaming had it occurred, testified that they did not hear a woman screaming
    that night.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In light of these credibility issues, the
    appellant claims that it was incumbent on the trial judge to provide careful instructions
    to the jury. He argues that the trial judge was duty-bound to relate the
    problematic aspects of the complainant’s evidence, including the evidence
    undermining her testimony, to the central issue of credibility. The appellant
    argues that the charge to the jury fell short in this regard. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Despite the capable submissions of the appellant’s
    counsel, we do not give effect to this ground of appeal. While we accept that
    there were issues with the complainant’s evidence, which needed to be carefully
    considered by the jury, a functional and contextual approach to the jury charge
    leads to the conclusion that the jury was well equipped to properly consider
    the evidence, including its inconsistencies. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Early on in the charge to the jury, the trial
    judge provided the jury with the tools necessary to consider issues of both
    credibility and reliability. Included in that instruction was an emphasis on
    the jury’s need to consider inconsistencies in a witness’s evidence and whether
    they appeared to result from an “honest mistake” or a “deliberate lie”. The
    jury was told that a deliberate lie is “always serious” and could taint all of
    a witness’s evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Later, the jury was instructed to pay particular
    attention to the complainant’s evidence because the Crown’s case rested
    “wholly” upon her evidence. Therefore, the trial judge warned it was
    “essential” for the jury to test the complainant’s evidence “in the light of <em>all</em><i> </i>of the other evidence presented” (emphasis in original). This instruction
    was repeated and reinforced just one paragraph later. The jury was then told
    the following: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In this case there were a number of inconsistencies
    in the complainant’s own evidence and a number of inconsistencies between the complainant’s
    evidence and the testimony of other witnesses. While it is true that minor
    inconsistencies may not diminish the credibility of a witness unduly, a series
    of inconsistencies may become quite significant and cause you to have a
    reasonable doubt about the reliability of the witness’s evidence. There is no rule
    as to when, in the face of inconsistency, such doubt may arise but at the least
    you should look to the totality of the inconsistencies in order to assess
    whether the witness’s evidence is credible and reliable. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Then, later in the charge to the jury, the trial
    judge again pointed out the importance of prior inconsistent statements in
    assessing a witness’s veracity, suggesting that any such differences “may be
    important in deciding whether or how much you believe of or rely upon the
    witness’</span><span lang=EN-CA>[s]</span><span lang=EN-CA> testimony.” The
    trial judge then used a prior inconsistent statement of the complainant as the
    first example of how this rule of evidence operates. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, when summarizing the parties’ positions
    for the jury, the trial judge devoted twice the amount of time to the defence
    position than the Crown position. The defence position was rooted entirely in
    what was said to be the complainant’s failure to tell the truth to the jury. The
    argument that the “complainant [was] not telling the truth” was highlighted multiple
    times by the trial judge, each time accompanied by a review of the evidence
    said to undermine the complainant’s version of events. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, while the appellant is right that
    there were credibility issues that the trier of fact had to consider in this
    case, it is our view that the jury was properly equipped to consider these
    issues. It is not for this court to reconsider those credibility findings. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Verdicts are Not Inconsistent </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also argues that the verdicts are
    inconsistent, as the complainant’s account of choking is “inextricably
    intertwined” with the sexual assault itself. Therefore, this court must set
    aside the conviction on sexual assault and align it with the acquittal on
    choking to overcome resistance. We do not accept this submission because it was
    open to the jury to arrive upon different verdicts. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The question to be resolved when considering
    whether verdicts are inconsistent is “whether the verdicts are supportable on
    any theory of the evidence consistent with the legal instructions given by the
    trial judge”: <em>R. v. Pittiman</em>,<i> </i>2006 SCC 9, </span><span
lang=EN-CA>[2006] 1 S.C.R. 381,</span><span lang=EN-CA> at para. 7. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The crime of choking to overcome resistance
    contains additional elements, beyond those involved in a sexual assault. In
    addition to the essential elements making up a sexual assault, the Crown must
    also prove that there was a choking and that the choking was done with the
    intent to render the complainant “incapable of resistance”: <em>Criminal Code</em>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, s. 246(a). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> It was open to the jury to accept all, some, or
    none of the complainant’s testimony as it pertained to the offence of choking
    to overcome resistance. The jury was properly instructed to this effect. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The differing verdicts in this case could have
    resulted from different things. By way of example, the jury may have accepted the
    complainant’s evidence supporting the conviction for sexual assault but
    rejected her evidence as to the fact of having been choked. Alternatively, the
    jury may have accepted the complainant’s evidence on that point but had a doubt
    about the appellant’s <i>mens rea </i>– the intent to overcome resistance. Equally,
    the jury may have been uncertain about the complainant’s evidence and unprepared
    to act on it without some physical evidence to support the complainant’s claim.
    Notably, while the complainant had no bruising to her neck, she had bruising
    and a small tear in her anus. While the latter injury was not necessarily
    evidence of a sexual assault, it was not inconsistent with one either. Yet, the
    lack of bruising to the neck may have caused the jury to have a reasonable
    doubt on the count of choking to overcome resistance. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Therefore, it cannot be said that the verdicts
    are inconsistent. </span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Unreasonable Verdict Ground </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Finally, the appellant argues that the
    conviction for sexual assault constitutes an unreasonable verdict. He contends
    that the acquittal on the choking count is a “red flag”. We have already
    addressed why we do not see it that way. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant also maintains that there were
    sound reasons to doubt the complainant’s credibility. We have already set out some
    of the alleged problematic aspects of her evidence. We pause to note here that
    the respondent rejects many of the arguments advanced by the appellant as to
    why the complainant’s credibility was shaken at trial. To the contrary, the
    respondent argues that many of the factors cited by the appellant are not
    problematic when viewed in the context of the whole record. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We see no need to resolve each of these areas of
    alleged concern. As previously explained, the charge to the jury was complete
    and forceful as it related to the need for the trier of fact to focus in on the
    issue of credibility and resolve the problems identified by the appellant
    before considering entering a conviction. Having regard to those legally
    correct instructions, a verdict of guilty on the sexual assault count was
    available to the jury. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This court does not act as a thirteenth juror: <em>R.
    v. W.H.</em></span><span lang=EN-CA>, 2013 SCC 22, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 180, at
    para. 27</span><span lang=EN-CA>. In our view, the conviction on the sexual
    assault count is supportable on “any<i> </i>reasonable view of the evidence”: <em>R.
    v. Burke</em>, </span><span lang=EN-CA>[1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at para. 7; </span><em><span

lang=EN-CA> </span></i><span lang=EN-CA>Said differently, considered as a
    whole, the evidence does not preclude the conclusion reached by the jury: <em>R.
