    assault, criminal harassment, and breach of recognizance, contrary to sections
    271(1), 264(2)(b) and 145(3) respectively of the <em>Criminal</em> <em>Code</em> <em>of Canada</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.</span></p>

    offences to the extent required by the nature of the issues raised on the
    appeal. I then turn to what occurred before and at the trial concerning the
    appellant’s representation by counsel, the requests made of the trial judge for
    a mistrial and appointment of an <em>amicus,</em> and how those requests were
    dealt with. Against that background, I discuss each of the appellant’s grounds of
    appeal.</span></p>
  <h1><span lang=EN-CA>BACKGROUND</span></h1>
  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>The Offences</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For several years, the appellant was in a
    relationship with the complainant, N.S. They had a child together.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the fall of 2012, N.S. and the appellant were
    living in separate residences. N.S. wanted to end the relationship completely,
    but the appellant was highly resistant to that occurring.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> In September or October 2012, N.S. and the
    appellant were at the appellant’s apartment with their child. N.S. attempted to
    leave to put the child to bed, but the appellant told her she had to have sex
    with him before she left. N.S. told him that she did not want to. The
    complainant and the appellant fought physically and verbally. He prevented her
    from calling the police, and initially prevented her from leaving his apartment
    at all. When he finally relented to the extent of allowing her to go to his
    parents’ apartment in the same building, he took her purse from her.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>When N.S. arrived at the appellant’s parents’
    apartment, she explained to his mother that she wanted to go home, that the
    appellant had her “stuff”, and that he was demanding they have sex despite her
    not wanting to. The appellant’s mother told her to have sex with the appellant
    and “get it over with”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant then arrived at his parents’
    apartment, and he and his parents engaged in a heated argument. After ten to fifteen
    minutes, N.S. returned with the appellant to his apartment where sexual
    intercourse occurred. She testified that “I didn’t consent really. I–I did it
    so I could go home. So I’m not really consenting.” She explained that she did
    not really have a choice. If she had not engaged in intercourse with the
    appellant, “(t)here would have been more fighting, more—I’d be a prisoner,
    wouldn’t be allowed to go home.”</span></p>

    trial fairness has been compromised” and “in order to avoid miscarriages of
    justice”. Given that the trial judge is in the best position to determine these

    trial judge’s reliance on the appellant’s motive to delay was procedurally
    unfair, as the existence of this motive was neither put to the appellant nor
    argued by the Crown, and rested on an insufficient evidentiary basis. Second,

    concerns. He advised the appellant that he was concerned about the stage of the
    proceeding when this was being raised, especially since the appellant had been
    afforded, and had not taken up, the opportunity to request an adjournment before
    the jury was selected. The concern that this was a delay tactic was thus
    effectively put on the table. On the record before him, the trial judge was
    entitled to draw the conclusion that a desire for delay motivated the request
    for a mistrial.</span></p>

    each of the grounds that the appellant put forward in support of his request

    justify the rejection of the mistrial request whether or not it was motivated
    by a desire for delay.</span></p>

    forward. He considered the appointment of <em>amicus</em> and the assistance
    and accommodation required for the appellant as a self represented accused.
    These are discussed below. He did not err in failing to consider alternatives
    raised for the first time on appeal, such as having the appellant re-elect

    had occurred up to the point the appellant decided to discharge his counsel that
    compromised trial fairness. The decision of the appellant to render himself
    unrepresented for what remained of the trial was not, in these circumstances,
    something that necessitated a mistrial to avoid a miscarriage of justice. The

    to appoint, as <em>amicus,</em> either trial counsel or the appellant’s lawyer
    in another case. There is a sharp distinction between the duties of a lawyer
    acting as <em>amicus</em> and the duties of defence counsel, so much so that a
    “lawyer appointed as&nbsp;<em>amicus</em>&nbsp;who takes on the role of defence
    counsel is no longer a friend of the court”: <em>CLA</em>, at paras. 49-56. The
    same issue of conflicting duties to the court and the accused that arise when
    the role of <em>amicus</em> is expanded to the role of defence counsel, the
    point addressed in <em>CLA</em>, would be present if former defence counsel, or
    defence counsel in another case (each of whom owed duties to the appellant),
    were given the role of <em>amicus</em>.</span></p>

    did not over-emphasize the significance of the delay. His reason for not
    appointing <em>amicus</em> was that he could provide guidance to the appellant.
    This was the pivotal consideration. The appointment of <em>amicus</em> is to
    take place when it is “essential”. It is not essential in “the vast majority of
    cases”, as long as the trial judge provides guidance to the unrepresented
    accused so that “a fair and orderly trial can be ensured without the assistance
    of an <em>amicus</em>”: <em>CLA</em>, at para. 116, per Fish J. (dissenting,
    but not on this point). The appellant has not identified a complex issue on
    which the trial judge required the assistance of <em>amicus</em> in order to
    ensure the court’s duty to an unrepresented accused was fulfilled.</span></p>

    an ostensible voluntary agreement was vitiated by fraud later discovered by the
    complainant. Here, the issue was whether there was any voluntary agreement at
    all.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA> The Crown’s case turned on the credibility of
    the complainant. Her evidence was of an absence of any voluntary choice to
    participate in sexual activity. She testified that she did not want to engage
    in sexual activity, never communicated consent, and only engaged because she
    felt she had no choice—otherwise she would not be allowed to go home. Neither
    her evidence, nor the Crown’s theory at trial, presented a situation of an ostensible
    voluntary communicated consent requiring a separate second step consideration
    of whether that consent was vitiated.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The adequacy of the instruction is a function of
    whether it allowed the jury to comprehend the case and equipped them to fulfil
    their adjudicative mandate on the sexual assault charge, given the evidence and
    the theory of the case: <em>R. v. Bonnell</em>, 2015 NBCA 6, 321 C.C.C. (3d)
    247 at para. 84, leave to appeal refused, 2015 CarswellNB 311. In my view, the
    instruction given met that standard. The jury was asked whether N.S.
    voluntarily agreed to engage in sexual activity without the influence of force,
    threat, fear, fraud, or abuse of authority. In the context of this case, the
    instruction directed them to consider whether N.S. had made an actual voluntary
    choice to participate in sexual activity. The appellant was not prejudiced in
    this case by the instruction given.</span></p>
