    from the conviction entered on June 27, 2018, and the sentence imposed on February

  <p><strong><span lang=EN-CA>Lauwers
    J.A.:</span></strong></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some post-verdict sentencing delay often occurs in criminal
    cases. Such delay can violate an offender’s right to be tried within a
    reasonable time under s.&nbsp;11(b) of the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</span></em>. In <em><span lang=EN-CA>R. v.
    Charley</span></em>, 2019 ONCA 726, 147 O.R. (3d) 497, <em><span lang=EN-CA>per</span></em> Doherty J.A., this court laid out the governing principles. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley </span></em>set the presumptive ceiling for
    post-verdict sentencing delay at five months, with certain exceptions. Doherty
    J.A. said, at para. 87: “I stress that five months is not the norm, and should
    not be allowed to become the norm.” He explained: “five months is the point at
    which the delay is sufficiently long that it is regarded as presumptively
    unreasonable for the purposes of s. 11(b).” He added: “The onus falls to the
    Crown to justify the delay.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court also held that the principles set out in <em><span lang=EN-CA>R.
    v. Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,<em> </em>2016 SCC 27, [2016] 1 S.C.R.
    631, governing</span> pre-verdict delay should be applied, with necessary
    modifications, to post-verdict sentencing delay. Doherty J.A. noted that exceptional
    circumstances could justify delay above the presumptive ceiling, including a
    dangerous offender application as a discrete event, and including the
    transitional exceptional circumstance for cases in the system before the
    introduction of the new ceiling: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>, at
    paras. <span lang=EN-CA>98, 100, </span>105.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>R. v. Hartling</em></span>, 2020 ONCA
    243, 150 O.R. (3d) 224, <em><span lang=EN-CA>per</span></em> Benotto J.A., the
    court found that the usual remedy for a breach of the presumptive ceiling for
    sentencing delay was not a stay of prosecution but a mitigation of sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge did not have the benefit of this court’s decisions in <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em> and <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hartling</span></em>.
    The argument before us took these cases into account. Applying the principles
    in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em> and <em><span lang=EN-CA>Hartling</span></em>,
    the post-verdict delay in this case was not unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=Heading>Facts and Decision Below</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was charged on March 28, 2017, tried from June 4-6,
    2018, and convicted on June 27, 2018 of robbery with a firearm contrary to s.
    344(1)(a), and forcible confinement contrary to s. 279(2), of the <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Criminal Code</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, </span>R.S.C. 1985, c.
    C-46. The total time from charge to conviction was 14 months and 29 days. There
    was no defence delay; defence concessions simplified the proceedings. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge detailed the delay in sentencing. She noted that
    the Crown advised the defence <span lang=EN-CA>of the possibility of a
    dangerous offender application</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span><span lang=EN-CA>in
    June&nbsp;2017, </span>during <span lang=EN-CA>the judicial pretrial phase of
    the case, and confirmed its intention after the conviction on June 27, 2018.
    The Crown applied under s. 752.1 for an assessment hearing. On July 11, 2018, a
    hearing date was set for October 4, 2018. The trial judge noted that the first
    date available to the Crown and the court was July 24, 2018, but the defence
    was not available on that date.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge completed the assessment hearing
    on October 4, 2018 and dismissed the dangerous offender application on November
    5, 2018. The sentencing hearing was set for January 28, 2019 and a pre-sentence
    report was ordered.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 21, 2019, the appellant brought an application for a
    stay of the prosecution on the basis that his s. 11(b) <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charter</span></em> right to be tried within a reasonable time had been breached by the delay in
    sentencing. The application was heard on January 28, 2019 and dismissed on
    February 14, 2019. The appellant was sentenced to nine-years’ imprisonment on
    February 26, 2019.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge calculated a total sentencing
    delay of seven months and one day. She took the view that this total </span><span
lang=EN-CA>should be reduced by two months and ten days on account of the defence’s
    unavailability for the dangerous offender assessment, and by one month and one
    day for the dangerous offender application itself</span><span lang=EN-CA>. Deducting
    a total of 3 months and 11 days, she found </span><span lang=EN-CA>the
    remaining post-verdict delay to be 3 months and 20 days. The trial judge
    concluded that this delay was not unreasonable.</span><span lang=EN-CA> </span></p>
  <p class=Heading>The Positions of the Parties</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submitted that the five-month presumptive ceiling was breached by the
    post-verdict sentencing delay. He argued that the trial judge mischaracterized two
    months and ten days as defence delay, and that the Crown’s application for a dangerous
    offender designation was frivolous. The possible validity of the second
    argument was acknowledged by Doherty J.A. in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>,
    at para. 102. The appellant argued that because the sentencing delay was
    excessive and unjustified, the sentence should be reduced, and proposed a
    reduction of 10&nbsp;percent or 11 months in the sentence, citing<em><span
lang=EN-CA> Hartling</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submitted that the dangerous offender application was not frivolous, so
    that, following <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>, at para. 100, it must
    be treated as a discrete event and an exceptional circumstance. Accordingly,
    the time taken for the application is to be deducted from the net sentencing delay,
    as <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em> prescribes at para. 104. The Crown
    also argued that the transitional exceptional circumstance for cases in the
    system before the introduction of the new presumptive ceiling, recognized in <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>, at para. 105, should be applied.</p>
  <p class=Heading>The Post-Verdict Sentencing Delay</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    presumptive ceiling for post-verdict sentencing delay operates “in the same
    manner, and with the same qualifications” as the pre-verdict ceilings set out
    in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em>: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>,
    at para. 128. Under the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA> </span>framework for pre-verdict delay, the total delay is measured
    “from the charge to the actual or anticipated end of trial”: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em>, at para. 49. In fixing the presumptive ceiling
    for sentencing, Doherty J.A. set the relevant time as “the time between verdict
    and sentencing”, at para. 84. On the facts in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>,
    at para. 95, he calculated the total post-verdict delay from the date of the
    finding of guilt to the anticipated date of sentence. Accordingly, in line with <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>and applying
    the <em><span lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em><span lang=EN-CA> </span>framework, total
    sentencing delay should be calculated from the date of the verdict to the
    actual or anticipated date of the sentence. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge calculated a total delay of seven months and one day, from the date
    of the verdict, June 27, 2018, to the date on which the s. 11(b) application
    was heard, January 28, 2019. The total delay in this case should instead be
    calculated from the date of the verdict, June 27, 2018, to the date on which
    the appellant was sentenced, February 26, 2019. The total post-verdict sentencing
    delay is therefore just under eight months. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delays
    attributable to the defence must be subtracted from the total delay: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em>, at para. 60; and see <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>,
    at para. 95. The Crown and the trial judge were available to commence the s.
    752.1 hearing on July 24, 2018, but the defence was not. That hearing took
    place on October 4, 2018. The trial judge attributed the period of delay between
    those two dates, two months and ten days, to the defence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this period of delay was not properly attributable to the defence. In setting
    the date for the s. 752.1 hearing, the defence gave available dates in July and
    August 2018, and specifically said: “I would take an August date if my friend
    can accommodate it”. The trial Crown said: “With respect to an August date, I
    think that will be difficult at this point”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was not a case where the Crown was ready to proceed and the defence was not: <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em>, at para. 64. The appellant argues, and the Crown
    does not appear to contest, that the Crown was not realistically available to
    argue the application on July 24, 2018. There is no indication of any other dates
    between July and October 2018 on which the Crown and the court were available
    but the defence was not. On this basis, this period of delay cannot fairly be
    attributed to the defence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    other period of delay was attributed to the defence. With no defence delay to subtract,
    the net delay is just under eight months, exceeding the five-month ceiling by
    three months. This delay is presumptively unreasonable, a presumption that can
    only be rebutted by exceptional circumstances: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em>,
    at para. 68. There are two potentially relevant exceptional circumstances in
    this case: the dangerous offender application, and the transitional exceptional
    circumstance.</p>
  <h2>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Dangerous Offender Application </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    dangerous offender application is properly characterized as an exceptional
    circumstance: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>, at para. 98. However,
    where that application is frivolous, the Crown cannot rely on it as an
    exceptional circumstance to reduce the net delay: <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>,
    at para. 102. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the dangerous offender application in this case was
    frivolous. That argument fails on the trial judge’s own assessment. She said:</p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>While the Crown was ultimately unsuccessful in
    their endeavor for the assessment, and they relied on rather generic material, </span><span
class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>there is nothing to suggest that such an
    application viewed in hindsight was an inappropriate or an abusive use of Crown
    discretion</span></span><span lang=EN-CA>. Furthermore, while the Supreme Court
    of Canada meant to change the culture of complacency in criminal court by
    urging all parties to make meaningful progress in a case, I do not read the
    decision to require either party to perform to a standard of perfection or to
    only litigating successful applications. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In my view,  the dangerous offender application
    was clearly not frivolous. To be clear, I should not to be taken as approving
    the trial judge’s approach to the evidence of dangerousness. To the contrary, the
    pattern of violence exhibited by the appellant could have formed the basis of the
    dangerous offender designation, consistent with the principles in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>R. v. Hogg</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, 2011 ONCA 840, at para. 40.
    Here, the trial judge identified a pattern of escalating violence. I disagree
    with her statement that, necessarily, “a pattern of behaviour is something more
    than a history of violent criminal offending.” A pattern could exhibit
    hallmarks, but it need not. The key question is whether the offender would
    likely reoffend in the same way – by excessive violence – in the future.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>, at para. 100, Doherty J.A. attributed the time between the
    verdicts and the dismissal of the s. 752.1 application to the exceptional
    circumstance of the dangerous offender application. Here, the date of the
    verdict was June 27, 2018, and the s. 752.1 application was dismissed on
    November&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2018. A period of four months and eight days passed
    between these dates. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    under eight months, would bring the remaining delay well within the five-month
    ceiling. However, Doherty J.A. notes, in </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em><span
lang=EN-CA>, at para. 98, that even where delay can be attributed to an
    exceptional circumstance, the Crown has an obligation to mitigate the delay. The
    appellant submitted that the Crown failed to do so in this case and argues that
    the Crown delayed collecting material on the application and providing it to
    the defence, even though the sparse materials the Crown ultimately relied upon
    were available before conviction.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As noted, the trial judge attributed much of the
    delay prior to the dismissal of the s. 752.1 application to the defence and found
    that the application caused a “not particularly long” delay of one month and
    one day. In </span><em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>,
    at paras. 97 and 99, Doherty J.A. found that the Crown acted reasonably where the
    s. 752.1 application caused a five-month delay. But in </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, unlike in this case, the Crown
    began to assemble the application materials before the verdict and relied upon
    material that was not available until after the verdict: </span><em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em><span lang=EN-CA>, at para. 97.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The reasonable time requirement for the
    preparation of the s. 752.1 application falls between one and five months. I
    would set the reasonable time requirement, given the sparse materials the Crown
    compiled, at two months. It took just over a month for the trial judge to
    decide the application. Three months can therefore be attributed to the
    application and deducted from the net delay for the exceptional circumstance of
    the dangerous offender application in this case.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>This leaves a remaining post-verdict sentencing
    delay of just under five months, which is just below </span><em><span

    delay, while perhaps unfortunate, did not breach the appellant’s s. 11(b) </span><em><span

  <h2><span lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Transitional Exceptional Circumstance </h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As noted in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>, at para.
    105, the transitional exceptional circumstance identified by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <em><span lang=EN-CA>Jordan</span></em>, at paras. 95-104, applies
    with necessary modifications to post-verdict sentencing delay. The transitional
    exceptional circumstance would apply in this case because the post-verdict delay
    in sentencing occurred before the release of this court’s decision in <em><span
lang=EN-CA>Charley</span></em>. Because the remaining delay does not exceed the
    presumptive ceiling, there is no need to rely on the transitional exceptional
    circumstance in this case.</p>
