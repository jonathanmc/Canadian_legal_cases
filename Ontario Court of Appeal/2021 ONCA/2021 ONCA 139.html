    Court of Justice, dated January 15, 2020, reported at <em>R. v. Lai</em>, 2020
    ONSC 0231.</span></p>
  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The respondent, a practitioner of Traditional
    Chinese Medicine (“TCM”), was charged with sexually assaulting three clients.
    The alleged assaults occurred in the course of the respondent’s purported
    treatment of the complainants. With respect to C.B. and L.B., the defence conceded
    the relevant touching occurred, but argued it was part of an appropriate TCM
    treatment referred to in the evidence as “energy work”. With respect to the
    allegations of S.C., which the defence conceded did not involve conduct which
    could be described as acceptable TCM treatment, the defence maintained the
    conduct never occurred. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant did not testify. An expert in TCM
    did testify, describing the accepted treatments and techniques used in various TCM
    treatments, including “energy work”. The treatments could include touching and
    massaging of a client’s chest and touching of the pelvic area, just above the
    vagina. Touching of the vagina or labia was not part of any accepted treatment.
    In any event, whatever the treatment, it was essential that the practitioner
    obtain the client’s consent to any touching. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge acquitted the respondent on all
    counts. In doing so, she held that the evidence of each complainant was not
    admissible as similar fact evidence on the counts involving the other
    complainants.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown appeals.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal focuses primarily on the trial
    judge’s treatment of one part of C.B.’s evidence. C.B. testified that during a
    session involving “energy work”, the respondent rubbed her breasts under her
    sweater and touched her labia. Shortly afterward, she spoke to the respondent
    on the telephone. According to C.B., the respondent said he wanted her to come back
    for another energy treatment and he intended to put his finger in her vagina. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown claimed the statement made by the
    respondent was evidence rebutting the defence contention that any touching
    during the prior session involved appropriate treatment. The Crown also argued
    the statement was a tacit admission of the prior assault and an indication of the
    respondent’s intention to repeat the assaultive conduct, if afforded the
    opportunity.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The defence argued, among other things, that
    C.B.’s evidence concerning the substance of the conversation with the
    respondent was unreliable and should not be accepted as an accurate account of
    the conversation.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge reviewed C.B.’s evidence at
    length. With respect to her evidence about the phone call with the respondent
    shortly after the alleged assault, the trial judge concluded, at para. 463:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The evidence as to the phone call and its
    contents did not assist me one way or the other as to the nature of the
    touching that occurred on October 9, 2012. I cannot rely on C.B.’s testimony as
    to what was said on that call and attribute a “guilty mind” to Mr. Lai as
    suggested by the Crown.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown submits the trial judge erred in law
    by failing to properly analyze the relevance and probative value of C.B.’s
    evidence concerning the statement made to her by the respondent during the
    phone call. The Crown argues the trial judge wrongly limited her consideration
    of the probative value of the evidence to its potential admissibility as post-offence
    conduct going to the respondent’s state of mind. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>We cannot agree with Crown counsel’s
    interpretation of the trial judge’s reasons at para. 463. In our view, in that
    passage the trial judge indicated she was not prepared to accept C.B.’s evidence
    as to the content of the conversation she had with the respondent. In short, the
    trial judge could not find the respondent said what C.B. testified he had said
    during the conversation. Absent a finding the statement was made, there was no
    basis upon which to go on and consider the inferences that could or could not
    be drawn from that statement had it been made. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge gave two reasons for finding
    that C.B.’s evidence concerning the conversation was unreliable (see paras.
    461-62). Both reasons are supported in the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>It was open to the trial judge to come to the
    conclusion she did in respect of the reliability of C.B.’s evidence. More
    importantly, for the purposes of this appeal, her determination as to the
    reliability of that part of C.B.’s evidence did not give rise to any question
    of law upon which the Crown could appeal to this court. Deciding what evidence
    to accept as reliable and what evidence to reject as unreliable is an essential
    first step in the fact-finding process. This evidence failed to clear that
    first hurdle. The Crown cannot point to any error in law tainting the trial
    judge’s finding. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Crown’s second ground of appeal arises out
    of the trial judge’s similar fact ruling. The Crown candidly acknowledges this
    ground cannot succeed if the first ground of appeal fails. As we have rejected
    the first ground, it follows that this ground of appeal fails as well.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
