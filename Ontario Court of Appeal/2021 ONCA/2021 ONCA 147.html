  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant, AA, and the respondent, CC, have
    two children. The respondent, BB, was a friend of CC. In April 2013, following AA
    and CC’s separation, the local children’s aid society (the “Society”) received
    a report from an anonymous caller that she had witnessed AA abusing his
    children and partner. BB made the call. The report was false. AA commenced an
    action against BB and CC claiming damages for intentional infliction of
    emotional distress, conspiracy, slander, and libel. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA’s action focused on two events. First, the
    April 16, 2013 report that BB made to the Society, which AA alleged was false
    and made at the behest of CC. Second, the April 25, 2013 telephone interview of
    CC by an employee of the Society (the “Interview Call”) as part of an investigation
    of the initial report from BB, during which CC made several statements about
    AA. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The first trial of AA’s claim took place in late
    2016, with the trial judge’s reasons released in June 2017: 2017 ONSC 3458 (the
    “First Reasons”). The trial judge granted AA judgment against BB for slander, awarding
    him $5,000 in general damages and $5,000 in punitive damages. However, the
    trial judge dismissed AA’s claim against CC. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As a result of AA’s discovery of fresh evidence
    regarding CC’s role in BB’s report to the Society, the trial judge re-opened
    the trial and heard further evidence in November and December 2017. The trial
    judge released reasons in July 2018: 2018 ONSC 4173 (the “Second Reasons”). At
    the re-opened trial, the trial judge found that CC and BB conspired together to
    have BB make the false report to the Society, which slandered AA: at paras. 70
    and 78. He granted judgment in favour of AA against CC and BB for $25,000,
    payable on a joint and several basis (the “Judgment”).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA represented himself at the trials. He sought
    costs of approximately $120,000 (796.95 hours x $150/hour) and $2,500 for
    disbursements. The trial judge awarded AA no costs for his time and
    disbursements of only $1,000 (the “Costs Order”): 2018 ONSC 7490, at paras. 16-17.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In order to protect the identities of AA and
    CC’s children, the trial judge ordered that letters be used for the parties’
    names. However, the local sheriff’s office was not prepared to enforce the Judgment
    in that form. To remove that obstacle to enforcement, the trial judge issued a
    subsequent order (the “Naming Order”) that continued the use of lettered names
    in the proceeding but directed that a new court file be opened for enforcement purposes.
    He stated, in 2019 ONSC 3423 (the “Naming Reasons”), at para. 14:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>To address the plaintiff’s difficulty in
    enforcing his judgment, an order shall be prepared and entered by the court’s
    administration in accordance with Rule 59.03 of the Rules of Civil Procedure
    (Form 59B) using the full names of the parties and granting judgment in favour
    of the plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 against both defendants, jointly and
    severally. That judgment shall be placed in a new court file with a new court
    file number, containing no reference whatsoever to this file. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA appeals the two trial judgments, the Costs Order,
    and the Naming Order. For the reasons set out below, I would allow the appeal of
    AA’s claim for damages in respect of statements CC made during the Interview
    Call and his appeal of the Costs Order, in part, but dismiss the balance of the
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>II.       THE QUALIFIED PRIVILEGE ISSUE</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The issue stated</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As part of its investigation into BB’s call, an
    employee of the Society, Ms. Cooper, sought to interview CC about the events
    surrounding BB’s earlier report. Ms. Cooper conducted a telephone interview
    with CC on April 25, 2013, a little over one week after BB had made her report.
    The trial judge reviewed the evidence given at trial about the Interview Call
    at paras. 26 to 29 of the First Reasons. He wrote that Ms. Cooper testified, in
    part, that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>[CC] spoke about how AA was abusive and
    vindictive … CC told Ms. Cooper that at work she has talked about her
    frustration with AA and the court process and had sought advice from peers on
    how to manage the situation. She talked at work about the fact that [one of
    their children] broke her leg. She has talked at work about how AA is a
    terrible parent and an abusive person and that AA will spin a conspiracy theory
    so she will never see her children again. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At para. 28, the trial judge wrote that CC
    testified, in part, that:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In her evidence, CC acknowledged that she did
    talk at work about [one of their children] breaking her leg, she does seek
    advice from her co-workers but at no time has she used AA’s name. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>After reviewing the law on qualified privilege in
    his First Reasons, the trial judge was not satisfied that AA had made out a
    separate claim for slander against CC for the answers she gave to the Society
    when questioned. He found that CC’s communications to the Society on that
    occasion were protected by qualified privilege, stating, at para. 68:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Communication with child welfare agencies
    responsible for protecting children in the course of their investigations is,
    in my view, but another “classic example” of an occasion of qualified privilege
    as referred to by the Court of Appeal in <em>Cusson v. Quan</em>. To find
    otherwise, would make it impossible for such public agencies to carry out their
    difficult but very necessary responsibility of protecting vulnerable children.
    I have no doubt that most interviews conducted in the course of such
    investigations will include statements that tend to lower another’s reputation
    in the eyes of a reasonable person. CC spoke to Ms. Cooper about AA on the
    promise from Ms. Cooper that she would not disclose what CC told her. This
    expectation was reasonable. Her discussion with Ms. Cooper was protected by
    qualified privilege, even if it included CC making admissions about what she
    said to others at work.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>At the re-opened trial, the trial judge heard
    fresh evidence that led him to conclude that:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>BB and CC acted in combination, by agreement or
    common design, to make a false report to the Society: Second Reasons, at para.
    70; and</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast><span
lang=EN-CA>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>CC was the source of the information BB reported
    to the Society: Second Reasons, at para. 71.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge awarded $25,000 in damages
    against both BB and CC in respect of BB’s false reporting call, allocated as
    follows: (i) $10,000 for intentional infliction of emotional distress; (ii)
    $10,000 for slander; and (iii) $5,000 in punitive damages, in light of the “malicious
    nature of the false referral”: Second Reasons, at para. 83.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the trial judge maintained his
    dismissal of AA’s claim against CC for statements made during the Interview
    Call. Using the identical language from his analysis in the First Reasons, the
    trial judge held that CC’s statements to the Society were protected by
    qualified privilege: Second Reasons, at para. 80. Having made that finding, in
    his Second Reasons the trial judge did not go on to consider whether the
    qualified privilege was defeated by any malice on the part of CC. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA submits that the trial judge made two errors
    in dismissing his claim against CC for the statements she made during the
    Interview Call with the Society: (i) finding that CC’s statements were
    protected by qualified privilege despite an internal Society document about
    general service standards, which the trial judge refused to admit at trial, stating
    that communications to the Society are not privileged; and (ii) failing to
    consider AA’s argument that any claim for qualified privilege was defeated by evidence
    that CC lied or misled the Society during the Interview Call.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The state of the appeal record </span></p>

    defamatory of another may assert, by way of defence to an action for defamation
    or slander, that the statement was made on an occasion of qualified privilege.
    A defamatory statement made on an occasion of qualified privilege does not
    attract liability: <em>RTC Engineering Consultants Ltd. v. Ontario</em> (2002),
    58 O.R. (3d) 726 (C.A.), at para. 14. Although the trial judge correctly stated
    the principles regarding the concept of qualified privilege in the law of
    defamation,</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As to AA’s defamation claim based on CC’s
    statement to the Society employee that she had commented on AA’s parenting to
    her co-workers, the conflicting evidence set out at para. 18 above, together
    with the absence of any evidence at trial from a co-worker of CC who was the
    recipient of any such statement, leads me to conclude that AA has not
    established, on a balance of probabilities, the element of identification
    essential to a defamation claim: Raymond E. Brown, <em>Brown on Defamation</em>,
    2nd ed. (Toronto: Thomson Reuters, 2020), at ch. 6.1. However, given CC’s
    admission at trial that the Case Note accurately reflects the conversation she
    had with the Society employee during the Interview Call, I will proceed on the
    basis that CC told the Society employee that AA was “an abusive and vindictive
    man” and a “terrible and abusive parent”. Those statements certainly defamed
    AA. My analysis of the trial judge’s qualified privilege finding will treat
    these as the defamatory statements at issue in the Interview Call and will
    hereafter refer to them as the “Defamatory Statements”.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>AA’s first argument on qualified privilege</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The appellant advances two arguments in support
    of his contention that the trial judge erred in finding that the Defamatory
    Statements CC made during the Interview Call were protected by qualified
    privilege. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>First, AA argues that the trial judge erred by
    refusing to admit a Society document which he contends demonstrates that the
    Interview Call was not an occasion of qualified privilege. As described in AA’s
    factum, the document stated, in part:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Communication between a worker and client are
    not recognized in Ontario as privileged, and as a result, Individuals and
    records may be subpoenaed by the Court. Information which clients have assumed
    would be held in strict confidence may have to be disclosed in the course of
    due legal process. Clients should, therefore, be advised of the limitations of
    the agency's ability to maintain confidentiality.</span></p>
  <p class=BContinuingPara><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge ruled that he would
    not admit the document because it fell outside the scope of admissible evidence
    for the re-opened trial.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I see no error by the trial judge in refusing to
    admit the document. The document does not assist in determining whether the
    Interview Call was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. The references
    in the Society document to “privilege” are not references to the concept of
    qualified privilege in the law of defamation. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>More relevant to the issue of whether the Defamatory
    Statements were made on an occasion of qualified privilege is s. 125 of the <em>Child,
    Youth and Family Services Act, 2017</em>, S.O. 2017, c. 14, Sched. 1 (“<em>CYFSA</em>”).
    That section sets out the obligation of a person to report information to a
    society where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a child has suffered
    various kinds of harm. Section 125(10) creates a form of statutory qualified
    privilege:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>This section applies although the information
    reported may be confidential or privileged, and </span><span class=Underline><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The statements made by CC to the Society were in
    response to the Society’s request that she provide it with information as part
    of its investigation into BB’s call. Given its obligation to ascertain the
    accuracy of reports made to it, the Society had an interest in receiving
    information from CC about the call and, on her part, CC had a duty, whether
    legal, social, or personal, to provide the Society with the requested
    information: <em>RTC Engineering Consultants</em>, at paras. 14-16. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in

  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>AA’s second argument on qualified privilege</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As his second argument, AA submits, in effect,
    that the trial judge failed to determine whether CC’s claim for qualified
    privilege was defeated by her malice.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his discussion of the applicable legal
    principles, at para. 68 of the Second Reasons, the trial judge recognized that
    the defence of qualified privilege could be defeated by actual or express
    malice or if CC’s statements exceeded the limits of the applicable duty or
    interest: <em>Korach v. Moore</em> (1991), 1 O.R. (3d) 275 (C.A.), at pp. 278-80,
    leave to appeal refused, [1991] S.C.C.A. No. 30; <em>Bent v. Platnick</em>,
    2020 SCC 23, 449 D.L.R. (4th) 45, at paras. 128 and 136. The limits of the
    privilege were explained by this court in <em>RTC Engineering Consultants</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>,</span></em> at para. 18:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Not everything said or written on an occasion
    of qualified privilege is protected. As is evident from the term “qualified
    privilege” itself and from the previous discussion, the privilege is not
    absolute. It may be lost in one of two ways. <span class=Underline>First, it
    may be lost if the <a name="_Hlk62466397">dominant motive for making the
    statement was malice.</a></span> In this context malice means not just ill will
    towards another but any ulterior motive that conflicts with the interest or
    duty created by the occasion. And it includes recklessness. Both dishonesty and
    a reckless disregard for the truth may amount to malice. <span class=Underline>Second,
    a privilege may be lost if the statement is not commensurate with the occasion,
    either because the statement is not germane and reasonably appropriate to the
    occasion or because the recipients of the statement have no interest in
    receiving it.</span> Put differently, to maintain privilege a defendant must
    communicate appropriate information to appropriate people. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In considering whether malice by the maker of
    the statement defeats qualified privilege, the primary consideration is the
    state of mind of the maker at the time the words were published: <a
name="_Hlk65738817">Brown, at ch. 16.2(2)</a>. The presence of an improper
    motive is the critical consideration.&nbsp;The privilege will be lost if it is
    shown that the statement was published for a collateral motive&nbsp;unrelated
    to the privilege’s purpose: Brown, at ch. 16.3(1). Accordingly, malice is
    essentially a question of good faith.&nbsp;The privileged occasion must be used
    for the purpose for which it is given;&nbsp;it must not be misused or abused by
    a defendant: Brown, at ch. 16.3(1).</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In <em>RTC Engineering Consultants</em>, this
    court, at para. 18, identified some aspects of the factual inquiry when it
    stated that malice in the context of qualified privilege “means not just ill
    will towards another but any ulterior motive that conflicts with the interest
    or duty created by the occasion. And it includes recklessness.”</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Unfortunately, the trial judge’s reasons on the
    issue of qualified privilege are brief and cryptic. He did not expressly make a
    finding about whether AA had proven CC made the Defamatory Statements with
    malice, thereby defeating the qualified privilege. However, given that he
    dismissed AA’s claim in respect of the Defamatory Statements on the basis of
    qualified privilege, the following remarks made at para. 80 of his Second
    Reasons might appear to address that issue of whether CC made the statements with
    malice: </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=Underline><span lang=EN-CA>I have no doubt that
    most interviews conducted in the course of such investigations will include
    statements that tend to lower another’s reputation in the eyes of a reasonable
    person. CC spoke to Ms. Cooper about AA on the promise from Ms. Cooper that she
    would not disclose what CC told her. This expectation was reasonable</span></span><span
lang=EN-CA>. Her discussion with Ms. Cooper was protected by qualified
    privilege, even if it included CC making admissions about what she said to
    others at work. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In the highlighted portion of these remarks, I
    take the trial judge to be saying that interviews by Society employees
    conducted during an investigation into a report often will result in the
    interviewee making defamatory comments about the subject of the investigation. As
    CC was responding to inquiries made by the Society employee, her comments are
    not necessarily the product of malice, but the product of the candour needed to
    ensure that such interviews operate as an effective investigatory tool. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, AA argues that, since the trial judge had
    found CC and BB combined to make a malicious initial referral to the Society, that
    malice would defeat any qualified privilege in respect of statements made by CC
    during the subsequent Interview Call. I do not accept that submission, as
    framed. The finding of malice in respect of the initial report does not
    automatically mean that malice was the dominant motive for CC making the statements
    over a week later during the Interview Call. The issue is whether, at the time
    of the Interview Call, malice was the dominant motive for CC making the
    Defamatory Statements: <em>RTC Engineering Consultants</em>, at para. 23.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge failed to make a finding as to
    whether CC made the Defamatory Statements with malice. That was an error. It
    therefore falls to this court to decide the issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Here, CC told the Society employee during the
    Interview Call that AA was an “abusive and vindictive man” and “a terrible and
    abusive parent”. CC made these statements during the Society’s investigation
    into BB’s serious allegations of abuse against AA. CC falsely denied knowing
    anything about the referral or its source. Yet, she used the occasion of the Interview
    Call to repeat, and therefore reinforce, allegations similar to those BB made
    in her false referral.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given those circumstances, and against the
    background of the trial judge’s findings that the initial referral allegations were
    made with malice, it is not possible to characterize CC’s Defamatory Statements
    during the Interview Call as simply an impulsively unreasonable or irrational
    emotional outburst. The preponderance of the evidence discloses that CC made
    the Defamatory Statements with malice, that is dishonestly or recklessly as to
    their truth, thereby defeating a defence of qualified privilege for CC.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Notwithstanding that finding of liability
    against CC, in my view any damages for CC’s Defamatory Statements are nominal.
    CC made the Defamatory Statements only to the Society employee, whose files are
    sealed from general public view or access. As well, the Society closed its file
    regarding BB’s referral because it concluded the allegations against AA were
    unverified and malicious. In these circumstances, I would assess AA’s damages
    at $500.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Consequently, I would allow AA’s appeal with
    respect to the dismissal of his claim for slander against CC in respect of the
    Interview Call. I would otherwise dismiss his appeal in respect of the trial
    judgments.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>III.      APPEAL FROM THE COSTS ORDER</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Leave to appeal a costs order will not be
    granted save in obvious cases where the party seeking leave persuades the court
    there are strong grounds upon which the appellate court could find that the
    judge erred in exercising his or her discretion: <em>Brad-Jay Investments Limited
    v. Village Developments Limited</em> (2006), 218 O.A.C. 315 (C.A.), at para. 21,
    leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 92. An appellate court should set
    aside a costs award only if the trial judge has made an error in principle or
    the costs award is plainly wrong: <em>Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd.</em>,
    2004 SCC 9, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303, at para. 27.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA submits that the trial judge erred in failing
    to award pre-litigation costs related to the work he undertook with respect to
    the Child and Family Services Review Board and <em>Norwich</em> application
    proceedings. I disagree. It was entirely within the trial judge’s discretion
    not to award those costs. I see no error in the exercise of his discretion.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA next submits that the trial judge erred in
    failing to award him any costs for the time he spent on these proceedings. I do
    not accept this submission. In the present case, the trial judge identified and
    applied the correct principles of law, namely those stated in <em>Fong v. Chan</em> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 330 (C.A.). The trial judge held that AA failed to prove
    that he had to give up remunerative activity in order to perform work on this
    case that ordinarily would be done by a lawyer. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA submits the trial judge erred in so finding.
    However, while in this proceeding AA testified that he had to take off work
    during his earlier family law trial, neither the transcript nor his cost
    submissions at the re-opened trial demonstrate that AA had to forego
    remunerative activity to work on this case. AA’s statement, without more, that
    he had to work less than he otherwise would in order to focus on preparing
    paperwork and appearing in court is insufficient. Accordingly, I see no
    reversible error in the trial judge denying AA costs for work he conducted on
    this proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As to disbursements, the trial judge limited the
    award to $1,000 because AA had not filed a breakdown to support his request for
    $2,500 in disbursements. I have reviewed the cost outlines found at Tabs A and
    B of AA’s July 29, 2018 cost submissions to the trial judge. While they do not
    break out costs and disbursements in a way typically seen in a cost outline
    prepared by a lawyer, to my eye a fair reading of AA’s incurred disbursements
    would place them at $1,500.00. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal from the
    Costs Order to the extent of varying the disbursements awarded from $1,000 to $1,500.</span></p>

    332. Although the trial judge did not refer to the principles set out in <em>Sierra
    Club</em>, at para. 53, and <em>Vancouver Sun</em>, at paras. 30-31<em>, </em>his
    Naming Reasons disclose that, in essence, he considered: (a) whether some
    restriction on the naming of the parties was necessary to prevent a serious
    risk to the welfare of AA and CC’s children; and (b) whether the salutary
    effects of such a restriction would outweigh its deleterious effects. That
    analysis has been applied by Ontario courts to initialize or otherwise protect
    the identities of parties and their children in civil matrimonial litigation: <em>L.C.F.
    v. G.F.</em>, 2016 ONSC 6732, 86 R.F.L. (7th) 338, at paras. 17-18; <em>S.M. v.
    C.T.</em>, 2020 ONSC 4819, 46 R.F.L. (8th) 109, at paras. 27-28; <em>G.S. and
    K.S. v. Metroland Media Group et al.</em>, 2020 ONSC 5227, 46 R.F.L. (8th) 357,

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>AA wants proper names used in all court orders
    and reasons in this proceeding so that he can inform “professionals providing
    care for the children” about the behaviour of BB and CC. The trial judge was
    concerned about such a possible use of proper names in court reasons, stating
    at para. 11 of his Naming Reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Using actual names will always present a much
    higher risk of offending subsection 87(8) [of the <em>CYFSA</em>]. Once the
    names of the parties are revealed in a court decision, it will be difficult, if
    not impossible, for the court to know what additional facts included in the
    judgment may still point to or identify the persons protected by subsection
    87(8). Even the use of initials is potentially compromising, particularly where
    it can be discovered that the full names of the same parties have been used in
    another related proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>That was a reasonable concern for the trial
    judge to have in the circumstances. It was also a reasonable basis upon which
    to exercise his discretion to use letters for the parties names in the court
    file but, in order to allow AA to enforce the Judgment, to use proper names in
    the public judgment in a separate, unconnected file. Finally, while AA certainly
    has a legitimate concern in protecting his reputation, this action did not
    involve defamatory statements that were widely published. BB and CC made their
    statements to employees of the Society. There was no evidence that those
    statements were re-published. The trial judge exercised his discretion in a
    balanced way, taking into account the interests of all parties, the children,
    and the public.</span></p>
