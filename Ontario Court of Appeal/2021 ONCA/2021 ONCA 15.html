    shot in the abdomen while at an after-hours club. A single bullet shattered his
    pelvis as it passed through his body. He was in a coma for 16 days, underwent
    several surgeries, and remained in the hospital for a month. A photo array was
    presented to the victim soon after he emerged from the coma and while still
    under medication. He picked the appellant’s photo but said he was not sure. He
    did not mention having seen a gun. When a second photo array was presented <span
style='color:black'>some </span>days later the victim positively identified the
    appellant, said he had not seen a gun, but added the appellant <span
style='color:black'>was known to carry </span>a gun.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA style='color:black'>At trial the </span><span
lang=EN-CA>victim testified he was at the after-hours club in the early morning
    when he saw the beginnings of a physical altercation between two men. Acting as
    “a good Samaritan” he physically intervened by pushing one man aside. Then,
    while inquiring what was going on, he was shot. He testified that after being
    shot he saw the appellant holding a gun. The victim had seen the appellant a
    few times before and knew him by a nickname. Nothing negative had ever passed
    between them and he did not know of any reason the appellant might have to harm
    him.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>A few weeks after the shooting the police spotted
    the appellant’s car while he was driving and boxed it into a parking space.
    When they approached his car, he tried to flee and collided with <span
style='color:black'>one of the officers</span>. The police recovered a loaded
    handgun from the car that matched the spent bullet and casing found at the club
    after the shooting. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    at trial</span>. He acknowledged being at the after-hours club at the time of
    the shooting and standing in the room where the victim placed him at the time
    of the shooting. However, he denied being the shooter. He claimed that about a
    week after the shooting the owner of the club offered to sell him a gun at an <span
style='color:black'>extremely </span>low price. He bought the gun intending to
    sell it for a sizable profit. It never occurred to him the gun might be “hot”.</span></p>

    appellant guilty of attempted murder</span></h2>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found the appellant’s testimony “utterly
    unbelievable” and found it did not raise a reasonable doubt of his guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge accepted the victim’s testimony <span
style='color:black'>at trial </span>identifying the appellant and placing a gun
    in his hands. The trial judge said there was no reason to believe the victim
    was deliberately trying to set up the appellant to take the fall for the
    shooting. The victim had identified the appellant after regaining consciousness
    from a coma, and it would be a remarkable coincidence <span style='color:black'>that </span>he just <span style='color:black'>happened to point </span>the finger at
    the person <span style='color:black'>who was </span>found in possession of the
    gun <span style='color:black'>that had been </span>used. The victim’s testimony
    and the ballistics evidence were independent of each other, and both pointed to
    the appellant’s guilt.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge found additional support in the
    appellant’s conduct after the shooting. First, he had driven a friend to her
    place and then had spent the night there. The trial judge observed he had “no
    good explanation” for not going home. He accepted the Crown’s submission “that
    he did not go home because he was afraid that police would be looking for him
    and the first place they would look was his house.” Second, after the
    appellant’s illegally parked car had been towed away during the night, the
    appellant did not retrieve his car himself but sent a friend. The trial judge did
    not believe he had another family obligation and accepted the Crown theory
    “that [the appellant] knew he had hidden the gun in the car and he was afraid
    that he would be arrested if he went to pick up the car himself”.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge rejected the defence’s argument <span
style='color:black'>at trial </span>that the position of the victim, the
    apparent trajectory of the bullet, and the position of the bullet and shell
    casing after the shooting supported an inference that the shot came from a
    place in the room other than from where the appellant was standing. The trial
    judge found the bullet and shell casing may have been kicked as people fled the
    room and the argument was not supported by expert testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge said the eyewitness identification
    of the shooter combined with the police locating the gun in the car trunk of
    the person whom the eyewitness had identified as the perpetrator made this “an
    overwhelming crown case”.  </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The trial judge instructed himself as to the specific
    intent required for attempted murder, saying:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Attempted murder is a specific intent offence.
    The crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [the appellant]
    intended to kill [the victim]. Not just that he intended to shoot into a crowd
    of people or intended to fire the shot that ultimately hit [the victim]. The crown
    must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that [the appellant] had the specific
    intention to kill [the victim].</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Though there was no evidence of the motive for
    the shooting, the trial judge observed that “[t]he crown need not prove motive
    and intent may be inferred from the circumstances of the acts that took place.”
    The trial judge then inferred the appellant had the specific intent to kill the
    victim, saying:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Here, I find [the appellant] intentionally
    fired his handgun across about 20 feet of distance, about 6 metres, striking [the

    someone else. In <span style='color:black'>all of </span>these circumstances I

    respect to the consequence of striking the victim in the abdomen. The trial
    judge’s conclusion he had the specific intent to kill was an inference. The
    appellant accepts that where the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt the
    accused has committed a particular act, the common-sense inference may bridge

    an example an accused who, wildly brandishing a handgun, pulls the trigger and <span
style='color:black'>happens to hit </span>the head of a bystander 100 yards
    away. While it could be said that the accused shot the victim in the head, one
    could not make a common-sense inference that the accused had the specific
    intent to kill the victim. The appellant submits that in the circumstances of this
    case the trial judge misapplied the common-sense inference that sane and sober people

    marked on photographs in the record. The photographs <span style='color:black'>make

    the room. It is worth noting that in his reasons for sentence the trial judge said
    the distance between the appellant and the victim at the time of the shooting was
    six to seven metres. The trial judge’s finding was not clearly wrong,
    unsupported by the evidence, or otherwise unreasonable, and should not be interfered

    victim. This was corroborated by the evidence of the victim. The victim offered
    an account of having intervened in an altercation between two men, neither of
    whom bore any known connection to the appellant. The appellant had fired a
    handgun from a distance of about 20 feet across a dimly lit, crowded room <span

    might have noted there was no evidence that the victim was the intended target.
    That the shooter might have intended to shoot a different person, perhaps <span
