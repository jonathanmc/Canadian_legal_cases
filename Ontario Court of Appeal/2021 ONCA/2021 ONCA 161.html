  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>I.        OVERVIEW </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The issue on this appeal and cross-appeal is the
    interpretation of the provisions in the May 14, 1968 will of the late Sarah
    McMahon Grafton (the “Will”) regarding the disposition of her cottage property
    (the “Cottage Property”), which the estate trustee, The Canada Trust Company
    (“Canada Trust”), has sold. Sarah’s four surviving grandchildren, the ultimate
    beneficiaries under her Will of the proceeds of the Cottage Property’s
    disposition, disagree over how the Will directs the distribution of the
    proceeds. Canada Trust moved before the court for an interpretation of the Will. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The motion judge interpreted the Will as
    directing the proceeds be distributed equally amongst the four grandchildren of
    Sarah McMahon Grafton (“Sarah”) alive at the end of the life interests in the
    Cottage Property created by the Will: namely, the appellant, John Gordon Ross
    (“Gordon”), and his brothers, the respondents Stewart Graeme Ross (“Graeme”),
    James Grafton Ross (“Grafton”), and James Henry Ross (“James”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Gordon appeals, submitting that the motion judge
    erred in his interpretation of the Will. Gordon argues that the proper
    interpretation of the Will requires the net proceeds from the Cottage Property be
    divided into five equal shares, with distribution of two of the five shares to
    him. As a result, Gordon would receive 40% of the net sale proceeds, instead of
    the 25% which would result from the motion judge’s decision, subject to the
    result in other litigation between Gordon and his brothers.</span><a

lang=EN-CA>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Respondents cross-appeal. While they agree

    conclusion.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For the reasons set out below, I would dismiss

lang=EN-CA>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sarah was an astute and successful businesswoman
    who first ran a chain of men’s apparel stores and then a real estate business.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sarah had two daughters: Sarah Margaret Ross (“Margaret”)
    and Mary Elizabeth Grafton (“Mary”). </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Margaret married and had 5 children: Sarah Mary
    Jane Ross (“Jane”); Gordon; Graeme; Grafton; and James.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sarah died in 1971. At the time of her death,
    all of Sarah’s grandchildren were alive.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In 1992, Jane unexpectedly died, intestate and
    without a spouse or issue. As a result, Jane’s mother, Margaret, and her father
    were the beneficiaries of Jane’s estate. Margaret’s husband died in 1997. Under
    Margaret’s will, her entire estate, including any residue in Jane’s estate,
    passed to Gordon. However, the Respondents are challenging the validity of that
    will.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The Cottage Property</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Sarah’s Cottage Property on Lake Rosseau was the
    family’s central gathering place. It was a focal point of Sarah’s life and she
    strove to make it a family compound. All of her grandchildren spent their

    the Cottage Property. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Mary died in 2002, unmarried and without issue.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Margaret continued to use the Cottage Property
    following her sister’s death. Margaret was unable to meet her responsibility to
    pay the Cottage Property’s expenses. On April 19, 2013, Canada Trust, as estate
    trustee, obtained an order permitting the sale of the Cottage Property. The
    Cottage Property was sold in August 2013. Net proceeds of approximately $1.66
    million were realized, from which Canada Trust paid certain Cottage Property
    expenses. The balance was held by Canada Trust in a Cottage Trust account.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Margaret died on December 15, 2015, and her life
    interest in the Cottage Property ended. As of the date of Margaret’s death,
    approximately $1.138 million remained in the Cottage Trust for distribution.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Canada Trust proposed to distribute the net sale
    proceeds equally to the four grandchildren of Sarah then alive. Gordon
    objected. In 2016, Canada Trust made interim distributions to the four
    surviving grandchildren of $200,000 each. </span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Before the motion judge, the Respondents argued
    that the Will required the net proceeds of the sale of the Cottage Property to
    be divided amongst those grandchildren alive at the time of the sale of the
    Cottage Property. Since Jane had died prior to that event, the proceeds should
    be divided equally amongst the four surviving grandchildren. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In opposing his brothers’ position, Gordon
    argued that the proceeds should be distributed in accordance with clause
    3(I)(iii) of the Will, which requires the residue of Sarah’s estate to be
    divided in a way that would include the issue of Margaret living at Sarah’s
    death “per stirpes”. That would include Jane and the beneficiaries of her
    estate, arguably Gordon. As a result, the net proceeds should be divided into
    five equal shares and then distributed, with two of the shares going to Gordon
    as the beneficiary of Margaret’s estate, which would include any interest of
    Jane in her grandmother’s estate.</span></p>

    with the assistance of the “armchair rule”, disclosed that Sarah intended the

    alive at the end of the life interests of Sarah’s daughters, Mary and Margaret. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I propose to summarize the motion judge’s
    reasons in some detail as I intend to refer back to the summary when examining
    the grounds of appeal. In reaching his conclusion, the motion judge reasoned as
    follows:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst><span
lang=EN-CA>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Clause 3(C) of the Will provided that upon the
    death of the survivor of Sarah’s daughters, the Trustees were to convey the
    Cottage Property to Sarah’s grandchildren as joint tenants and not as tenants
    in common. Such a conveyance would only occur if the grandchildren unanimously
    agreed to accept the transfer “in their names”. The motion judge reasoned that
    this arrangement evidenced an intention that only Sarah’s grandchildren alive
    at the end of the daughters’ life interests could be the recipients of the
    conveyance. Consequently, the estate of a grandchild who had died prior to the
    end of the life interests could not hold an interest in the Cottage Property as
    a joint tenant: at para. 29;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Clause 3(C) stipulated that if the grandchildren
    did not agree to accept transfer of the Cottage Property as joint tenants, the
    Cottage Property was to be sold to “strangers”, with the “residue of the sale
    of the said property” to be held in trust for “my said grandchildren” in equal
    shares. The “said grandchildren” were those alive at the end of the life
    interests: at para. 33;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Clause 3(C) also empowered the Trustees in their
    absolute discretion to sell the Cottage Property in circumstances other than
    the death of the survivor of Mary and Margaret. In that case, the Trustees were
    to invest the proceeds in trust for her daughters during their lifetimes and,
    upon the death of the survivor of them, hold the “residue of the sale of such
    property” on the same trust as the “residue” resulting from a sale to a “stranger”
    after a failure of the grandchildren to agree to take title as joint tenants,
    namely for “my said grandchildren.” In the motion judge’s view, the use of the
    word “said” in reference to “my grandchildren” must be taken to refer to an
    earlier mention of “my grandchildren.” The use of the words “my grandchildren”
    immediately preceding the use of the phrase “my said grandchildren” was in
    reference to the prohibition of any conveyance to “any of my grandchildren” in
    the event that there was no unanimous agreement “among my grandchildren” to
    accept a transfer in their names as joint tenants. Accordingly, this referred
    only to those grandchildren alive at the end of the life interests: paras. 32
    and 33;</span></p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle><span
lang=EN-CA>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Most of the language in clause 3(C) evidenced
    that Sarah intended the beneficiaries of the trust of the “residue of the sale”
    of the Cottage Property following either a sale to a stranger or a sale by the
    Trustees in their discretion to be the grandchildren who survived the end of
    the life interests, which would not include Jane: at para. 34;</span></p>

    references in clause 3(C) to clause 3(I)(iii) created an interpretative

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>Each Judge must endeavour to place himself in

    disposition of his property. He must give due weight to those circumstances in
    so far as they bear on the intention of the testator. He should then study the
    whole contents of the will and, after full consideration of all the provisions
    and language used therein, try to find what intention was in the mind of the
    testator. When an opinion has been formed as to that intention, the Court

    the “armchair rule”. Ian Hull and Suzana Popovic-Montag, <em>Feeney’s Canadian
    Law of Wills</em>, 4th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2020) at §§10.45 and 10.46,
    describes the “armchair rule” as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>In the first instance, the court may not be
    convinced that the testator’s intention can be discerned from the will itself.
    In such a situation, since the testator must be taken to have used the language
    of the will in view of the surrounding circumstances known to him or her when
    he or she made his or her will, evidence of such circumstances is necessarily
    admissible, at least insofar as it corresponds to the facts and circumstances
    referred to in the will. It seems obvious that a court might conclude that
    admissible evidence of surrounding circumstances is not helpful in determining
    meaning.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>…</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The court puts itself in the position of the
    testator at the point when he or she made his or her will, and, from that
    vantage point, reads the will, and construes it, in the light of the

    the “armchair rule”.</span></p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Gordon submits that no inconsistency exists
    because clause 3(C) contemplates two different scenarios. In the first, the
    Cottage Property remains unsold until Sarah’s surviving daughter dies; in the
    second, the trustees sell the Cottage Property before the surviving daughter
    dies. In the first scenario, the testator’s use of the words “said
    grandchildren” refers to grandchildren alive at the end of the daughters’ life
    interests; in the second, it refers to any grandchildren alive at the
    testator’s death.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>For their part, the Respondents argue that
    Sarah’s specific direction to convey the Cottage Property to her grandchildren
    as joint tenants precludes the possibility that one of her grandchildren’s
    estates could hold an interest in the Cottage Property under either scenario
    advanced by Gordon. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>I do not agree with either submission on the
    plain meaning of clause 3(C)’s language. As to Gordon’s submission, I agree
    with the motion judge’s reasoning, summarized above in paras. 25(i)-(iv), that
    apart from the two references in clause 3(C) to the general residue clause
    3(I)(iii), the language used in the rest of the clause shows that Sarah
    intended the beneficiaries of the trust of the Cottage Property’s sale proceeds
    to be her grandchildren alive at the end of her daughters’ life interests. The
    testator’s first reference to “my grandchildren” in clause 3(C) is found in the
    direction to transfer the Cottage Property “to my grandchildren as joint
    tenants”. That direction is premised on a conveyance only to the grandchildren
    alive at the end of the daughters’ life interests, a point the motion judge
    noted that Gordon conceded: at para. 30. If those grandchildren will not all
    take as joint tenants, then the trustees are to sell the Cottage Property to a
    stranger, “not to any of my grandchildren”, which means those alive to take a
    conveyance as joint tenants. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The four subsequent references to grandchildren
    in clause 3(C) are to “my said grandchildren”: two are used in the scenario
    where the trustees must deal with the proceeds of a sale to a stranger
    following the death of the last daughter; the other two are used in the
    scenario where the trustees sell the Cottage Property before the death of the
    last daughter. All four of the references to “my said grandchildren” plainly refer
    back to the initial reference to “my grandchildren as joint tenants”, namely those
    alive at the end of the daughters’ life interests.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>As to the Respondents’ submission, it fails to
    deal with the Will’s references in clause 3(C) to the distribution directions contained
    in clause 3(I)(iii), the general residue clause. Although Sarah gave discrete
    directions to her trustees in clause 3(C) about how to deal with the Cottage
    Property, as distinct from the rest of her estate, she resorted to her Will’s
    general residue clause to deal with the proceeds from any sale of the Cottage
    Property. The general residue clause directed the distribution of part of the
    residue “among the issue of my daughter, the said SARAH MARGARET ROSS, living
    at my death”. I agree with the motion judge that incorporating the distribution
    directions contained in the general residue clause, clause 3(I)(iii), within
    the specific provisions of clause 3(C) dealing with the Cottage Property, created
    a patent inconsistency.</span></p>

lang=EN-CA>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>Given that inconsistency, the motion judge
    resorted to the “armchair rule”, stating at paras. 43-46:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The affidavit evidence filed by Gordon
    indicated that it was the Testator's wish that the Cottage Property stay in the
    family and she was emphatic that her grandchildren, and not their spouses,
    maintain control of it.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is evident from a review of para. 3(C) of
    the Will that the Testator, by directing that her grandchildren ultimately
    receive the Cottage Property as joint tenants and not as tenants in common,
    sought to ensure, to the extent possible, that it remain in her immediate family.</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The Testator’s desire to keep the Cottage
    Property in the family would be potentially frustrated if the estate of a

    a cross-appeal their complaint that the motion judge failed to rely solely on
    the plain meaning of the will. They do not cross-appeal the Judgment; they
    agree with it. Instead, they purport to cross-appeal from the motion judge’s
    reasons, contending that he erred in ruling that Sarah’s intent could not be
    determined having regard to the plain and ordinary meaning of the words in the
    Will. They seek a judgment that the Cottage Trust proceeds be divided into four

lang=EN-CA>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The Respondents’ cross-appeal reflects a
    misunderstanding of the nature of an appeal. As s. 6(1)(b) of the <em>Courts of
    Justice Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, states, an appeal lies to this court
    from a “final order” of a judge of the Superior Court of Justice, save for orders
    from which appeals lie to the Divisional Court. The authorities are clear: an
    appeal lies from the order or judgment, not the reasons for them: <em>R. v.
    Sheppard</em>, 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para. 4. This important
    distinction is explained succinctly in John Sopinka, Mark Gelowitz &amp; W.
    David Rankin, <em>Sopinka and Gelowitz on the Conduct of an Appeal</em><i>,</i> 4th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis, 2018), at </span><span lang=EN-CA>§</span><span

  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>It is a fundamental premise in the law of
    appellate review that an appeal is taken against the formal judgment or order,
    as issued and entered in the court appealed from, and not against the reasons
    expressed by the court for granting the judgment or order. Although the
    appellate court will frequently discover in the reasons for judgment errors of
    law that ultimately ground the reversal of the judgment or order, it is the
    correctness of the judgment or order that is in issue in the appeal, and not
    the correctness of the reasons.</span></p>

    EARLY VESTING</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>The issue stated</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>In his factum, Gordon raises an issue not set
    out in his notice of appeal. He contends that the motion judge failed to apply
    the “presumption of early vesting” to determine when the grandchildren’s
    interests in the cottage vested. According to Gordon, had he done so, the
    motion judge should have concluded that the Cottage Property vested in the
    grandchildren alive at Sarah’s death because when a gift made in a will is
    deferred due to a life interest given to another person, vesting takes place at
    the death of the testator.</span></p>
  <p class=Heading><span lang=EN-CA>Analysis</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The law presumes that a testator intends for
    interests to vest at his or her death or at the earliest moment thereafter as
    is consonant with the terms of the will: Albert H. Oosterhoff et al., <em>Oosterhoff
    on Wills, </em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>8th ed. </span></em>(Toronto:
    Thomson Reuters, 2016), at §17.3.2. An instance of the application of this
    presumption, upon which Gordon relies, is where there is a direction to pay the
    income of a fund to one person during his lifetime and to divide the capital
    among certain other named and ascertained persons on his death, even though there
    are no direct words of gift either of the life interest or of the capital. In
    those circumstances the rule is that vesting of the capital takes place in the
    remaindermen at the time of the testator’s death<em>: Browne v. Moody</em>,
    [1936] O.R. 422 (U.K. P.C.), at p. 427. </span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>However, the presumption of early vesting is
    just that – a presumption. Like any presumption, it may be displaced by a
    finding regarding the actual intention of the testator as reflected in her
    will. As put in <em>Feeney’s Canadian Law of Wills</em>, at §§17.7 and 17.8:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The courts are inclined to hold a gift as
    vested rather than contingent wherever the particular words used, and the will
    as a whole, admit of a construction that will result, as is said, in “early
    vesting”. That inclination has always been said to be particularly strong where
    the property is land. It is accurate to refer to the tendency of courts to call
    gifts “vested” as a presumption to that effect, so it can be said that gifts
    are to be held to be vested unless there is a clear condition precedent.
    Accordingly, a gift, whether a devise or a legacy, that makes no reference to
    the time of vesting should always be held to take effect at the testator’s
    death, unless that date of vesting would disturb provisions already made in the
    will, or unless the will, as a whole, evinces a clear intention that the gift
    operate contingently and at a later date. </span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span lang=EN-CA>The recent trend of jurisprudence has been to
    strive to establish and implement the actual intentions of the will-maker.
    Consequently, the presumption in favour of early vesting as well as any other
    “rules” of construction may be applied only if the courts have some doubt about
    the will-maker’s intention.</span></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-CA>The reasons of the motion judge disclose that he
    understood Gordon was arguing that Sarah’s gift of the Cottage Property vested
    in all her grandchildren, including Jane, who were alive at Sarah’s death,
    whereas the Respondents were contending that the words used by Sarah in her
    Will indicated an intent to postpone the vesting of the grandchildren’s
    interest until the death of the last life tenant: at paras. 19 and 26. In the
    result, after applying the “armchair rule”, the motion judge found that Sarah
    did not intend the estate of any grandchild who died after her and prior to the
    end of the daughters’ life interests to receive an interest in the Cottage
    Property or the proceeds of its sale. Central to that conclusion was the motion
    judge’s finding that Sarah desired to keep the Cottage Property in the family,
    a desire that potentially would be frustrated if the estate of a deceased
    grandchild could receive an interest in it: at para. 45. That finding rested
    heavily on the language of clause 3(C) that the grandchildren receive the
    Cottage Property as joint tenants, not tenants in common: at para. 44. Given
    the motion judge’s certainty about Sarah’s intention, there was no need for the
    motion judge to resort to the presumption of early vesting.</span></p>
