  <p class=AppealBookEndorsement><span lang=EN-CA>REASONS FOR DECISION</span></p>
  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of pointing a firearm; possession of a
    firearm without a license; discharging a firearm with intent to endanger;
    breach of probation; breach of recognizance; and possessing a firearm knowingly
    without a license. He was acquitted on a joint charge of possession of a weapon
    dangerous to the public peace.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant alleges numerous errors by the trial judge and contests
    the trial judges credibility and reliability findings. He points out that no
    gunshot residue was found on him and says this means he could not have been the
    shooter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see no merit in the appellants submissions. The trial judges
    credibility and reliability findings are entitled to deference and there is no
    basis for this court to interfere with them. As for the absence of gunshot
    residue evidence, the trial judge heard expert evidence and explained why the
    absence of gunshot residue did not raise a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duty counsel makes two submissions on behalf of the appellant. First, he
    submits that the trial judges decision that the appellants identification was
    established beyond a reasonable doubt is unreasonable. Duty counsel says that
    the witness Lals ability to provide a detailed description of the shooter was
    at odds with his inability to pick the appellant out of a photographic lineup.
    The witness Lahore was not in as good a position to identify the shooter, and
    his positive identification of the appellant is suspect because he was aware of
    the appellants name before the identification process and gave somewhat
    equivocal answers about whether he had seen the appellants photograph on the
    internet prior to identifying him.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lahore knew Jaggernauth, who was a nearby neighbour, but did not know
    the appellant. Lal did not know either man. Both Lal and Lahore identified
    Jaggernauth from a police photo lineup but only Lahore identified the
    appellant. His identification of the appellant was emphatic, as he wrote: Yes!
    This is most certainly the individual that fired the weapon. Lahores
    identification was enhanced by the fact that although the appellant lived at
    230 Howard Crescent, neither Lahore nor Lal knew this. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge considered and rejected the evidence that Lahores photo
    lineup identification of the appellant was tainted because he was told the
    appellants name prior to the lineup and might have looked him up on the
    internet. The trial judge accepted that Lahores evidence was solely the
    product of his accurate memory. He found that there was no collaboration,
    collusion or undue influence by Lahore or Lal on each other and found their
    evidence compelling and confirmed by the physical evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided clear and cogent reasons for being satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the person seen by Lahore and Lal was the
    appellant. Although Lal did not pick the appellant out of the police lineup,
    his description of the appellant was consistent with other evidence identifying
    the appellant, as well as the description of the police officers and the
    photograph of Omardeen that Lahore picked out of the lineup. There is no basis
    for this court to interfere with the trial judges findings.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duty counsel argues, secondly, that the trial judge erred in finding
    that the appellants attempt to avoid being arrested demonstrated consciousness
    of guilt. The appellant was unlawfully at large when the police attended 230
    Howard Crescent following the shooting and he had reason to avoid arrest that
    had nothing to do with the shooting.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    we note that the appellants post-offence conduct played only a minimal role in
    the trial judges finding of guilt. Having found the evidence of Lahore and Lal
    compelling and confirmed by independent expert and physical evidence, the trial
    judge went on to say that the appellants post-offence conduct supported the
    finding of guilt. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not err concerning the post-offence conduct evidence. There is
    no question that the appellant was hiding in the basement of 230 Howard
    Crescent following the shooting. The trial judge considered and rejected the
    argument that he was hiding to avoid arrest for being unlawfully at large. In
    all of the circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that the
    only plausible inference was that the appellant was attempting to evade the
    police because he was the shooter. This inference was amply supported by the
    circumstances surrounding the appellants arrest at the scene following the
    shooting  several police officers, with a police dog, yelling to the appellant
    to surrender  all of which indicated that the matter was far more serious than
    an arrest for failing to report to serve an intermittent sentence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant received a net sentence of 61 months imprisonment after receiving
    credit for 34.5 months time served. We see no error in principle nor is the
    sentence demonstrably unfit. The list of aggravating factors was extensive and
    included the appellants lengthy criminal record with violent offences and
    weapons crimes. The sentencing judges decision as to credit for presentence
    custody is entitled to deference. In summary, there is no basis for this court
    to interfere with the sentence on appeal.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
lang=EN-CA>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
