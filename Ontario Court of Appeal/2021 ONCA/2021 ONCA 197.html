  <p class=AParaNumbering>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario (“Ontario”) appeals from the
    summary judgment granted by the motion judge in which he found that Ontario
    owed a duty of care to the respondent, and his fellow class members, arising
    from the system of administrative segregation used in Ontario’s correctional
    institutions between April 20, 2015 and September 18, 2018. The motion judge
    also found that Ontario had breached that duty of care. The motion judge further
    concluded that Ontario’s system of administrative segregation breached the
    rights of the respondent, and his fellow class members, under ss. 7 and 12 of
    the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>. As a consequence of these
    breaches, the motion judge awarded aggregate <em>Charter</em> damages against Ontario
    in the amount of $30 million.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario raises three principal issues in its challenge to the motion
    judge’s conclusions:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred in holding Ontario liable in negligence.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred in finding that detaining seriously mentally ill
    inmates in administrative segregation violated ss. 7 and 12 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge erred in awarding <em>Charter</em> damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h1><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Background</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The use of administrative segregation in Ontario’s correctional
    institutions is authorized by <em>General</em>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 778 (“Regulation
    778”) promulgated under the <em>Ministry of Correctional Services Act</em><i>, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. M.22, s. 60(1).<i> </i>Section 34(1) of Regulation 778 grants the
    Superintendent of a correctional institution the authority to place an inmate
    in administrative segregation when:</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpFirst>a.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in the opinion
    of the Superintendent, the inmate is in need of protection;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>b.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in the opinion
    of the Superintendent, the inmate must be segregated to protect the security of
    the institution or the safety of other inmates;</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpMiddle>c.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the inmate is
    alleged to have committed a misconduct of a serious nature; or</p>
  <p class=MsoListNumberCxSpLast>d.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the inmate
    requests to be placed in segregation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As found by the motion judge, the respondent suffers from serious mental
    illness. He was held in the Toronto South Detention Centre for over two years
    on remand while awaiting trial on charges relating to a bank robbery. He was ultimately
    acquitted of all charges.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During his incarceration, the respondent was placed in administrative
    segregation twice, once for eight days. On both occasions he was alleged to
    have refused to take mental health medication that had caused him negative
    side-effects in the past. Correctional officials considered this conduct to
    constitute “refusing to follow an order”, which they determined justified a
    placement in administrative segregation. As found by the motion judge, the
    respondent’s experience in administrative segregation was excruciating; his
    anxiety was out of control; he felt terrorized and was in a state of delirium
    and shock.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2017, the respondent commenced this proceeding as a class action. He
    sought declarations that his, and the class members’, rights under the <em>Charter</em> had been infringed by Ontario’s system of administrative segregation and that Ontario
    was liable in negligence. The respondent sought damages in negligence and under
    s. 24 of the <em>Charter</em>. He also sought punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The class action was certified on consent by order dated September 18,
    2018. The class in this case is made up of two groups. One group is made up of inmates
    who are seriously mentally ill, such as the respondent (“SMI Inmates”). The
    other group is made up of those inmates, who may not be acutely unwell, but who
    were left in segregation for 15 or more consecutive days (“Prolonged Inmates”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Administrative segregation in Ontario consists of isolation in a small
    cell for 22 hours or more with no meaningful human contact. The cells have hard
    metal doors with a slot or &quot;hatch&quot; through which food is passed and
    basic communication may occur. Some cells have a window, which is usually
    frosted. The evidence shows that the cells are often filthy and covered in
    bodily fluids. Inmates face indefinite isolation and have no effective means of
    influencing their fate. Administrative segregation in Ontario may fairly be
    described by its more common expression, &quot;solitary confinement&quot;.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    does not appeal any findings of fact about its practice of administrative
    segregation. The motion judge found the conditions of administrative segregation
    in Ontario were &quot;the same or very similar&quot; as those in the federal
    system, which this Court has twice found to constitute cruel and unusual
    treatment, in <em>Canadian Civil Liberties Association v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</em><i>, </i>2019 ONCA 243, 144 O.R. (3d) 641 (“<em>CCLA</em>”), leave
    to appeal granted but appeal discontinued, [2019] S.C.C.A. No. 96, and <em>Brazeau
    v. Canada (Attorney General)</em><i>, </i>2020 ONCA 184, 149 O.R. (3d) 705 (“<em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>”).</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    uses solitary confinement for varying reasons including managing inmates’
    special needs and challenging behaviours. However, the mentally ill are
    markedly overrepresented among inmates subjected to administrative segregation.
    This overrepresentation is demonstrated by the fact that 43% of all admissions
    into segregation had a mental health alert on their file. These mentally ill
    inmates spend on average 30% more time in administrative segregation than other
    inmates. Considering this evidence, the motion judge found as a fact that
    Ontario &quot;routinely placed inmates with mental health or suicide risk
    alerts on file in administrative segregation”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    time, changes in the system of administrative segregation have been made by
    Ontario, at least some of which resulted from public interest remedies ordered
    by the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal as part of a settlement of other
    proceedings. Ontario also appointed an Independent Expert on Human Rights and
    Corrections, who found failings in Ontario’s compliance with its own policies.
    Ontario undertook other reviews, which continued to find problems in the
    system.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, an internal review in 2016 noted the harms caused by solitary
    confinement; that Ontario's administrative segregation practices qualified as
    solitary confinement; and that there was a need for reforms. In mid-2018, the
    Ontario Legislature passed the <em>Correctional Services and Reintegration Act,
    2018</em>, S.O. 2018, c. 6, Sched. 2. Among other things the legislation: (a)
    banned administrative segregation for mentally ill and other vulnerable
    inmates; (b) imposed a cap on the duration of administrative segregation for all
    inmates; and, (c) provided an independent review of all segregation placements.
    The legislation received Royal Assent on May 7, 2018, but it has yet to be proclaimed
    into force.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summarizing his view on the improvements in Ontario’s system and practices, the
    motion judge observed that “Ontario’s good words were not always followed by
    corresponding good deeds.”</p>
  <h1><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>III.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE DECISION BELOW</h1>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion
    judge gave lengthy reasons for his conclusions. He spent considerable time
    reviewing the evidence that was before him, including the expert evidence. We
    do not need to repeat his review as there appears to be little dispute regarding
    what that evidence reveals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    that evidentiary review, the motion judge made a number of what he referred to
    as “major” findings of fact. Those findings (at para. 269) may be summarized as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Heading>Administrative segregation</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Administrative segregation as practiced in Ontario constitutes
    solitary confinement within the meaning of the United Nations Standard Minimum
    Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (“Nelson Mandela Rules”).</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Nelson Mandela Rules promulgated by the United Nations
    represent an international consensus of proper principles and practices in the
    management of prisons and the treatment of those confined in prisons.</p>
  <p class=Heading>State of knowledge regarding solitary confinement</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Well before year 2000, it was widely known across the world, in Canada,
    and in Ontario, that placing inmates into solitary confinement caused serious
    harm.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before year 2000, it was known that an empowered independent
    review was needed of any placement in administrative segregation.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before year 2000, it was known that mentally ill prisoners should
    not be placed in administrative segregation and that alternatives should be
    developed for them as necessary to maintain the security of the prison or
    penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before year 2000, and ultimately codified in 2001 by the Nelson Mandela
    Rules at a 15-day maximum, it was known that no prisoners should undergo
    prolonged administrative segregation.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario knew about the growing condemnation of: (a) placing
    seriously mentally ill inmates in solitary confinement; and (b) placing inmates
    in prolonged solitary confinement. Ontario knew about the tragic incidents
    associated with prolonged solitary confinement, some of which had occurred
    within Ontario.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario knew that there was a worldwide consensus that solitary
    confinement should be a last resort for securing the safety of a correctional
    institution.</p>

  <p class=Heading>Practice in Ontario regarding solitary confinement</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ontario routinely placed inmates with mental health or suicide

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Up until 2015, Ontario's Administrative Segregation Policy did
    not require a physician, psychiatrist, or other mental health worker to assess
    a segregated inmate's mental wellbeing.</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then moved to consider whether there had been a breach of ss. 7
    and 12 of the <em>Charter</em> arising from Ontario’s system of administrative
    segregation, both with respect to the respondent and with respect to the
    members of the class. He concluded that there had been. It does not appear that
    Ontario contested that breaches had occurred with respect to the respondent.
    Rather, Ontario submitted that such breaches had not been demonstrated on a
    class-wide basis. The motion judge disagreed.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that the evidence revealed that, once a placement in
    administrative segregation has become prolonged, the stress and anxiety is
    serious and thus the security of the person guaranteed by s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em> was engaged. The motion judge also concluded that administrative segregation
    creates an increased risk of suicide for all class members, thereby infringing
    the right to life under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge moved to consider whether these infringements complied with the
    principles of fundamental justice. He concluded that they did not. The motion
    judge found that, while temporary segregation is rationally connected to the
    objective of security and safety, “a mode of temporary segregation that amounts
    to solitary confinement is not rationally connected to the objective of security
    and safety; rather, this mode of segregation degrades security and safety”. He
    therefore concluded that administrative segregation as practiced in Ontario was
    overbroad. The motion judge also found that the effects of administrative
    segregation were grossly disproportionate to the purposes of administrative
    segregation. Lastly, the motion judge found that, absent an independent timely
    review procedure, confinement in administrative segregation of any inmate
    violated procedural due process rights under s. 7 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then considered s. 12 of the <em>Charter</em>, that is, whether
    Ontario’s system of administrative segregation constituted cruel and unusual
    punishment. On this issue, the motion judge said, at para. 329:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>To demonstrate a violation of section 12, a plaintiff must show
    that the treatment or punishment is grossly disproportionate in the
    circumstances, such that it would outrage society's sense of decency. Gross
    disproportionality is only made out in &quot;extreme cases&quot; where the
    connection between a law's effect and its purpose is &quot;entirely outside the
    norms accepted in our free and democratic society.&quot; Demonstrating that a
    treatment or punishment was merely excessive is not sufficient to ground a
    finding that section 12 has been violated. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected Ontario’s position that this determination was inherently
    an individual one that could not be made on a class-wide basis. He found that
    the evidence established that a placement in administrative segregation, as it was
    administered by Ontario during the class period, was a cruel and unusual
    treatment of the class members, both the serious mentally ill inmates and the inmates
    who were administratively segregated for 15 or more days. The motion judge found
    support for at least part of this conclusion in the decision of this court in <em>CCLA</em>,
    where administrative segregation placements of more than 15 consecutive days were
    found to infringe s. 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. The motion judge also
    concluded that these infringements were not saved under s. 1 of the <em>Charter</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge moved from the <em>Charter</em> claims to consider the claim in
    negligence. On this issue, the motion judge considered Ontario’s submissions
    that:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The duty of care alleged by the respondent was not a recognized
    duty of care that fell within the category of cases where a duty of care by
    correctional officers to inmates had been recognized.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, the respondent had not proven the standard of care
    or a breach of the standard of care.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent’s negligence claim was essentially a challenge to
    policy decisions that are immune from liability.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition to the common law principles relating to policy
    decisions, the respondent’s negligence claim was precluded by Crown immunity
    and was extinguished by s. 11 of the <em>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act,
    2019</em>,<i> </i>S.O. 2019 c. 7, Sched. 17 (“<em>CLPA</em>”)<i>.</i></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected each of Ontario’s submissions. He found that Ontario did
    owe a duty of care to the respondent and the class members. In doing so, the
    motion judge distinguished this court’s decision in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> where
    it was found, at para 120, that a claim in systemic negligence could not be
    made out because the primary negligence claim was “negligence at the
    policy-making level”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected Ontario’s claim that the decisions in question were
    policy decisions. Rather, he found that they were operational decisions that
    did not escape liability, if negligently undertaken.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately,
    the motion judge concluded that Ontario owed a duty of care to the respondent
    and the class members, which Ontario had breached. He said, at para. 468:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the immediate case, (a) there is a duty owed to all the
    inmates in the way that Ontario runs its correctional institutions; <i>i.e.</i>,
    a responsibility across the corrections system for the collective of inmates in
    the system; (b) the standard of care for running the whole system, even an
    evolving standard of care, can be determined; and (c) there is a proven failure
    to meet the standard of care; <i>i.e.</i> there is systemic negligence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lastly,
    the motion judge found that the claim was not precluded by the <em>Proceedings
    Against the Crown Act</em>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.27, (“<em>PACA</em>”), or extinguished
    by virtue of the <em>CLPA</em>, which replaced the <em>PACA</em><i> </i>on July
    1, 2019 with retroactive effect<i>.</i><span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found liability both in negligence and under the <em>Charter</em>, the motion
    judge then dealt with the issue of damages. With respect to the <em>Charter</em>,
    the motion judge rejected Ontario’s position that a declaration of
    constitutional invalidity would be sufficient relief. He found, based in part
    on this court’s conclusions about <em>Charter</em> damages in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>,
    that damages were appropriate for the <em>Charter</em> breaches that he had
    found.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge considered the difficulty in assessing the proper amount to award
    for damages for a breach of the <em>Charter</em>. In the end, he concluded that
    an award of aggregate damages in the amount of $30 million was appropriate. The
    motion judge declined to separately assess the damages for negligence, other
    than to say that any amount for damages for negligence would be subsumed in the
    award of aggregate damages for the <em>Charter</em> breaches. The motion judge
    declined to award punitive damages.</p>

  <p class=Heading>A. Did the motion judge err in finding that detaining SMI

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    outlined above, the class consisted of inmates who had been held in
    administrative segregation in Ontario jails between April 2015 and September
    2018. The class was divided into two groups:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SMI Inmates
    were defined using two criteria. First, they had been diagnosed, either before
    or during their incarceration, as suffering from one or more of the mental
    disorders listed in the class definition. Second, their disorders had
    manifested themselves in one of the ways set down in the appendix to the class
    definition. These disorders included chronic and severe suicidal ideation,
    chronic and severe self-injury, and significant impairment in judgment,
    thinking, mood or communication. </p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    accepts the motion judge’s finding that administrative segregation for more
    than 15 consecutive days violates ss. 7 and 12 of the <em>Charter</em>. Ontario
    also accepts that the absence of a timely independent review process violates
    s.&nbsp;7 of the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>. Both
    concessions reflect the decision in </span></em><em>CCLA</em>, at paras. 2 and
    68, in which this court held detention in administrative segregation for more
    than 15 consecutive days violated s. 12.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span> The
    application judge in <em>CCLA</em> had held the absence of a timely independent
    review process violated s. 7: <em>Corporation of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association
    v. Her Majesty the Queen</em>, 2017 ONSC 7491, 140 O.R. (3d) 342 (“<em>CCLA
    (ONSC)</em>”), at paras. 155-156, rev’d on other grounds, 2019 ONCA 243. That
    finding was not challenged on the appeal to this court.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    does submit, however, that the motion judge erred in holding the s.&nbsp;7 and s.
    12 rights of SMI Inmates were breached when those inmates were placed in
    administrative segregation, regardless of the duration of that placement.
    Counsel submits that none of the previous administrative segregation cases have
    held that detention in administrative segregation for any period of time
    constitutes a <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> violation</span></em>.
    These cases include the motion judge’s own ruling in <em>Brazeau v. Attorney
    General (Canada)</em>, 2019 ONSC 1888, 431 C.R.R. (2d) 136, (“<em>Brazeau</em><i> (<em>ONSC</em>)</i>”), at paras. 313-318, rev’d on other grounds, 2020 ONCA 184.
    In <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em>, the motion judge found the s. 7 and s. 12 rights of
    SMI Inmates were breached after 30 or 60 days of administrative segregation,
    depending on whether the segregation was voluntary or involuntary. Neither
    party took issue with that finding on the appeal to this court: <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    further submits this court specifically declined in <em>CCLA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> to find </span></em>that subjecting an inmate with
    mental illness to administrative segregation of any length breached the s. 12
    right of those inmates: at paras. 62-67. Ontario contends that the motion judge
    was bound by <em>CCLA</em> unless the evidence in this case was materially different
    on the relevant issue. Ontario argues there was no meaningful difference in the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not read <em>CCLA</em> as deciding this issue. In <em>CCLA</em>, the
    applicant sought a declaration that the sections of the <em>Corrections and
    Conditional Release Act</em>, S.C. 1992, c. 20, authorizing administrative
    segregation were unconstitutional and rendered of no force and effect by s. 52
    of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>. Benotto J.A., for the court, concluded that
    detaining any inmate in administrative segregation for more than 15 consecutive
    days breached that inmate’s constitutional rights under s. 12 of the <em>Charter</em>:
    at paras. 4-5. She next considered whether administrative segregation, as it
    applied to certain specific identified groups of inmates, contravened the <em>Charter</em>.
    One group was described as inmates “suffering from mental illness”. After
    reviewing the provisions and policies referable to mentally ill inmates,
    Benotto J.A. said, at para. 66:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>While I agree with the application judge’s resolution of the apparent
    conflict between CD-709 and the Act, I do not share his confidence about the
    efficacy of s. 87(a) in preventing serious harm to inmates with a mental
    illness. In principle, I agree with the CCLA that those with mental illness
    should not be placed in administrative segregation. <span class=Underline>However,
    the evidence does not provide the court with a meaningful way to identify those
    inmates whose particular mental illnesses are of such a kind as to render
    administrative segregation for any length of time cruel and unusual</span>. I
    take some comfort in my view that a cap of 15 days would reduce the risk of
    harm to inmates who suffer from mental illness – at least until the court has
    the benefit of medical and institutional expert evidence to address meaningful
    guidelines. This issue therefore remains to be determined another day.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, unlike <em>CCLA</em>, the nature of the mental illnesses suffered by
    the class members and the manifestation of those illnesses were part of the
    class definition of SMI Inmates. SMI Inmates all suffer from diagnosed serious
    mental disorders. Furthermore, those disorders have manifested themselves in
    significant impairments and/or chronic and severe suicidal ideation or
    self-injury. In short, SMI Inmates are clearly seriously mentally ill.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    virtue of the class definition, the motion judge was required to consider, not
    the impact of administrative segregation on all inmates who might suffer some
    form of mental illness, but rather the impact on those who fell within the
    specific limits of the definition provided. That definition allowed the motion
    judge to “identify those inmates whose particular mental illnesses are of such
    a kind as to render administrative segregation of any length of time cruel and
    unusual”, as this court put it in <em>CCLA</em>, at para. 66.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge repeatedly referred to “seriously mentally ill” inmates in his
    findings. He clearly appreciated that all of the SMI Inmates suffered from
    serious, active, ongoing mental illnesses. It was in respect of that specific
    group the motion judge found any time spent in administrative segregation
    constituted cruel and unusual treatment.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing
    in <em>CCLA</em> is inconsistent with the motion judge’s finding in respect of
    the SMI Inmates. To the contrary, as counsel for the respondent submitted, the
    words from <em>CCLA</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 66</span></em> quoted above, presaged the very finding made by the motion judge in respect of
    the SMI Inmates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    also relies on the motion judge’s ruling in <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em>, released
    about a year before his decision in this case. <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em> was a
    class action brought by seriously mentally ill inmates confined in federal
    jails. The class definition in <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em> was very similar to the
    definition of SMI Inmates in this case: see <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em>, at paras.
    4-8.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>Brazeau
    (ONSC)</em>, the plaintiffs argued that any period of administrative
    segregation breached the s. 7 and s.12 rights of the seriously mentally ill
    inmates who made up the class<em><span style='font-style:normal'>:</span></em> at para. 12. The evidence in <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em> was much the same as the
    evidence in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>In his ruling in <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em>, the motion judge
    described the harm caused by administrative segregation to seriously mentally
    ill inmates as beginning “almost immediately after the doors are shut on the
    isolation cell”: at para. 313. He went on, however, to find the evidence
    established a breach of ss. 7 and 12 of the <em>Charter</em> on a class-wide
    basis only after 30 or 60 days, depending on whether the inmate had voluntarily
    gone into administrative segregation:<em><span style='font-style:normal'> at
    paras. 312-314.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>This court decided </span></em><em>CCLA</em> after the motion judge’s ruling in <em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. As indicated above, </span></em><em>CCLA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> placed a 15-day cap on administrative segregation
    for all inmates. The 15-day cap set in </span></em><em>CCLA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> overtook the motion judge’s finding in </span></em><em>Brazeau
    (ONSC)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, setting a 30 or 60-day cap in
    respect of seriously mentally ill inmates. Clearly, the physical and
    psychological harm caused by administrative segregation is exacerbated by
    serious mental illness. It must follow from the holding in </span></em><em>CCLA</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> that if all inmates suffer cruel and unusual
    treatment after 15 consecutive days in administrative segregation, seriously
    mentally ill inmates suffer cruel and unusual treatment at some point before 15
    days. The 30 and 60-day caps fixed in </span></em><em>Brazeau (ONSC)</em><em><span

    the motion judge to indicate why a cap of something less than 15 days in

    are supported by the evidence. In particular, the evidence of Dr. Chaimowitz
    and Dr. Grassian, reviewed at length by the motion judge, supports the finding
    that administrative segregation of SMI Inmates for any period of time violates
    their </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> rights
    under ss. 7 and 12. Nor does the motion judge’s different finding in </span></em><em>Brazeau

    makes the Superintendent responsible for “the care, health, discipline, safety

    an inmate in segregation for various reasons, including inmate safety, the
    safety of others, or the security of the institution. Section 34.0.1 goes on to
    provide for internal reviews of the status of persons held in administrative
    segregation. Section 34(5) of the regulation contemplated administrative
    segregation for more than 30 consecutive days but was deleted in November 2019 when
    Regulation 778 was amended by </span></em><em>General</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, O. Reg. 363/19. As the motion judge noted, at
    paras. 149-150, beyond these few provisions, the regulation sheds no light on
    the specifics of the administrative segregation regime, as operated in Ontario
    jails. There is not even a definition of segregation.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
    the years, including during the class period, Ontario issued various
    ministerial directives and policies fleshing out the details of its
    administrative segregation regime, as summarized by the motion judge, at paras.
    154-173. These directives and policies have, to some extent, ameliorated the
    conditions and circumstances giving rise to the <em>Charter</em> breaches the
    motion judge found. Unfortunately, as observed by the motion judge, at para. 269:
    “Many inmates are placed in administrative segregation contrary to Ontario’s

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever
    changes Ontario has made to its administrative segregation regime, and however

    five facts set out above were crucial to the motion judge’s ultimate conclusion
    that the s. 7 and s. 12 rights of all inmates within the class were routinely
    and consistently infringed throughout the entire class period. The nature and
    seriousness of the <em>Charter</em> breaches identified by the motion judge,
    particularly the s. 12 breach, were necessarily central to whether damages
    provided an “appropriate and just” remedy for those <em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> violations: </span></em><em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at para. 72</span></em>.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applicable legal principles</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    examination of any claim to <em>Charter</em> damages begins with the oft-quoted
    words of McLachlin C.J.C in <em>Vancouver (City) v. Ward</em>, 2010 SCC 27, [2010]
    2 S.C.R. 28, at para. 4:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I conclude that damages may be awarded for a <em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> breach under s. 24(1) where appropriate and just.
    The first step in the inquiry is to establish that a </span>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> right has been breached. The second step is to show
    why damages are a just and appropriate remedy, having regard to whether they
    would fulfil one or more of the related functions of compensation, vindication
    of the right, and/or deterrence of future breaches. </span></em><span
class=Underline>At the third step, the state has the opportunity to
    demonstrate, if it can, that countervailing factors defeat the functional
    considerations that support a damage award and render damages inappropriate or
    unjust</span><em><span style='font-style:normal'>. The final step is to assess
    the quantum of the damages. [Emphasis added.]</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third step identified in <em>Ward</em> is the focus of this case. As explained
    in <em>Ward</em>, the Crown may defeat an otherwise viable claim to <em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> damages by demonstrating </span></em>countervailing
    factors, rendering damages an inappropriate or unjust remedy: at para. 33. <em>Ward</em> refers to the availability of alternative remedies and “concerns for good
    governance” as two examples of countervailing factors: at paras. 32-38. Ontario
    relies on “good governance” concerns in its argument that damages are an
    inappropriate remedy in this case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Ward</em> uses the terms “good governance” and “effective governance” interchangeably. It
    does not offer a definition of either. Generally speaking, good governance
    concerns describe the potentially negative impact of <em>Charter</em> damage
    awards on the conduct of state actors charged with the responsibility of
    enacting laws and implementing and enforcing those duly enacted laws. The
    concern is that state actors will be deterred from performing those functions
    if they fear that, at some future point, a court will declare those duly
    enacted laws unconstitutional and award damages for acts done relying on the
    authority of the now unconstitutional laws: <em>Ward</em>, at paras. 39-41; <em>Henry
    v. British Columbia (A.G.)</em>, 2015 SCC 24, [2015] 2 S.C.R. 214, at paras.
    39-41.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><em>Ward</em> makes it clear that good governance concerns do not necessarily defeat a claim
    for damages. State conduct that is sufficiently blameworthy will give rise to <em>Charter</em> damages despite good governance concerns. For example, a law passed in bad
    faith will not be immunized from <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:
normal'> damages by good governance concerns. To the contrary, awarding </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> damages for state actions based on laws enacted in
    bad faith promotes good governance. The </span></em>blameworthiness threshold
    referred to in <em>Ward</em> is not a single bright line but will vary with the
    nature of the state conduct giving rise, both to the <em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> violations and the good governance claim</span></em>:
    see <em>Ward</em>, at paras. 39-43; <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>, at paras. 66-67.</p>

    of administrative segregation in federal prisons in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. In the cases of both Mr. Brazeau and Mr. Reddock,
    the motion judge had awarded aggregate </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> damages of $20 million for breaches of ss. 7 and 12
    of the </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>: </span></em><em>Brazeau

    ONCA 184. In Mr. </span></em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>Reddock</span></em><em><span

    inmates held in administrative segregation for more than 15 consecutive days: </span></em><em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at paras. 102-104. In Mr. </span></em><em><span

    appeal, this court agreed that seriously ill inmates who had been
    unconstitutionally held in administrative segregation were entitled to </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> damages. The court further determined that the
    motion judge attached certain improper conditions to the damage award he made.
    The court remitted that issue to the motion judge for reconsideration. He subsequently
    confirmed an award of $20 million in aggregate damages: </span></em><em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span

    damages as a </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> remedy in </span></em><em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> turned on whether good governance concerns should preclude a damage award and,
    if so, whether the state conduct was sufficiently blameworthy to override those
    concerns. Finally, as in this case, the regulatory scheme in </span></em><em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'> giving rise to the </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span

style='font-style:normal'>: </span></em><em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>, at paras. 39-40, 46-72, 100-101. The court,
    applying earlier authority, accepted good governance concerns were not limited
    to actions flowing directly from the enactment of legislation, but could arise
    in the context of a regulatory scheme involving statutes, regulations, and
    government policies. The court said, at paras. 56 and 59: </span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>We accept that at the third
    stage of the Ward test, the more general good governance concern does come into

    proof of individual or specific acts of maladministration. They challenge the
    regulatory scheme and the systemic practices and policies adopted by the
    correctional authorities in the application of the [relevant legislation].</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>…</p>
  <p class=CQuote>When a regulatory scheme is challenged, the state is entitled
    to assert that “concerns for good governance” immunity must be considered. The
    regulatory regime is the sort of policy choice for which, in the words of <em>Ward</em>,
    “the state might seek to show that s. 24(1) damages would deter state agents
    from doing what is required for effective governance”. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span

    actions done in the implementation of a regulatory scheme could give rise to

    legitimate good governance concerns:</span></p>
  <p class=CQuote><span class=MsoPageNumber>As we are dealing with a regulatory

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[68]<span

    the court turned to the evidence relevant to whether the correctional
    officials, on an institutional level, had been reckless or wilfully blind as to
    the unconstitutional effects of administrative segregation. The court referred
    to evidence offered by the respondent from a wide variety of international and domestic
    sources. That evidence revealed a well-established, longstanding consensus that
    prolonged administrative segregation, as well as administrative segregation of
    seriously mentally ill inmates, resulted in serious physical and psychological
    harm to those inmates: <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>, at paras. 74-99. The court
    concluded, at para. 100:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In our view, Canada’s failure to alter its administrative
    segregation policies in the face of this mounting and concerted criticism from
    the medical profession, a Royal Commission, a coroner’s inquest, the Correctional
    Investigator, and various international agencies meets the standard of a “clear

    this court in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>, Canada maintained an administrative
    segregation regime in the face of overwhelming evidence that the regime
    imperiled the constitutional rights of inmates. Given the reckless disregard
    for those rights, Canada could not successfully advance good governance
    concerns in answer to the damage claim advanced by the inmates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    set out above, Ontario takes issue with the <em>Charter</em><em><span

style='font-style:normal'>, only to the extent that the court looked to sources
    other than </span></em>Canadian judicial precedents when determining whether
    the state conduct showed a clear disregard for the constitutional rights of
    inmates. Ontario argues that the blameworthiness of its conduct had to be
    measured only against what Canadian courts had said about the constitutionality
    of administrative segregation. Ontario maintains the unconstitutionality of
    administrative segregation in Canada was not apparent until this court’s
    decision in <em>CCLA</em> in March 2019, after the close of the class period.<a

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario,
    as an intervener, unsuccessfully made this argument in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>.
    Assuming we can and should reconsider the merits of the argument on this
    appeal, we are satisfied the argument must fail.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><span
style='line-height:200%'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>State conduct showing a “clear disregard” for the
    unconstitutional consequences of that conduct is the antithesis of good
    governance. As explained in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>, a finding that the state
    clearly disregarded the unconstitutional consequences of its actions is
    predicated on a finding of recklessness or wilful blindness. Both require an
    appreciation of the risk that the impugned state action will infringe
    constitutional rights. When deciding whether correctional authorities acted
    with a “clear disregard” for the unconstitutional consequences of their
    actions, it is appropriate to take into account reliable information available
    to correctional authorities which, as a matter of common sense and logic, sheds
    light on the existence and degree of the risk of unconstitutional consequences
    flowing from administrative segregation. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, there was a great deal of expert evidence speaking to the longstanding
    knowledge in Canada, and internationally, of the very serious harmful effects
    of solitary confinement, particularly on the seriously mentally ill. Similarly,
    the evidence was replete with studies, reports and recommendations indicating
    the consequences of solitary confinement fell within the meaning of cruel and
    unusual treatment, as the phrase is used internationally and in the <em>Charter</em>.
    Most of that information was readily available to correctional authorities and
    would inform their appreciation of the risk that administrative segregation in
    provincial jails caused physical and mental consequences falling within the
    meaning of cruel and unusual treatment and denied inmates procedural due
    process.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    contends that, as only the courts can interpret and apply the constitution,
    only judicial pronouncements are relevant to whether state conduct shows a
    clear disregard for constitutional rights. There is no doubt only courts can
    authoritatively interpret the constitution. Constitutional interpretation is,
    however, not the same thing as assessing the degree of risk that a certain
    course of conduct will result in the infringement of constitutional rights. Ontario
    cannot turn a blind eye to overwhelming evidence of the unconstitutionality of
    its actions just because a court has yet to pronounce on that which is obvious.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judicial
    pronouncements on the constitutionality of government action go further than
    identifying a risk of a constitutional violation. They establish the reality of
    the violation. Other kinds of evidence, while not capable of establishing a
    violation, provide a basis against which the risk that certain state conduct
    violates well-established constitutional norms can be assessed. Ontario’s
    submission operates from the faulty presumption that the risk of constitutional
    breach can be measured only after the breach is formally proclaimed by way of
    judicial pronouncements. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the third step in <em>Ward</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, the motion
    judge had to </span></em>consider whether Ontario had demonstrated that good
    governance concerns made damages inappropriate. To establish the countervailing
    good governance concerns, Ontario had to show its conduct was not sufficiently
    blameworthy to negate any good governance concerns. In the context of a
    regulatory scheme, blameworthiness is equated with a clear disregard for the
    unconstitutional consequences of administrative segregation. To assess
    blameworthiness, the motion judge needed evidence about the physical and mental
    effects of administrative segregation on inmates, and what the correctional
    authorities could reasonably be taken to have known about those effects. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent produced a substantial body of evidence from both national and
    international sources, demonstrating the serious harms flowing from
    administrative segregation. Much the same evidence was heard in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>.
    Like the motion judge in this case, and the court in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>,
    we are satisfied that Ontario was aware of the very real risk, if not the very
    real likelihood, that administrative segregation, as practised in Ontario
    jails, routinely violated the constitutional rights of inmates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The information relied on in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> and by
    the motion judge in this case was properly considered in assessing the
    blameworthiness of Ontario’s actions at the third step of the <em>Ward</em> inquiry. That material fully justified the conclusion that Ontario’s clear
    disregard for the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> rights
    of the inmates precluded any reliance on those good governance concerns. </span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>The analysis to this point is enough to dispose of Ontario’s
    appeal from the damages award. Simply put, <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> controls.
    On that authority, damages for the <em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:

    damage award made by the motion judge. We note that the quantum of the damage
    award was not challenged on appeal.</span></em></p>

    for the purpose of determining the appeal, we will briefly address the
    respondent’s argument that good governance claims are not germane on the
    evidence adduced in this case. The respondent submits that administrative
    segregation in Ontario is the product of ministerial policies and management
    level operational decisions, rather than any specific statutory mandate. The
    respondent contends that good governance concerns arise only where state actors
    engage in conduct dictated by a statute which is subsequently held to be
    unconstitutional: see e.g. </span></em><em>Mackin v. New Brunswick (Minister of
    Finance)</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>, 2002 SCC 13, [2002] 1 S.C.R.

    accepted this argument, at para. 571:</span></em></p>
  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>[I]n the immediate case,
    Ontario’s civil servants cannot take cover with the argument that they thought
    they were acting in accordance with a lawful law. The very rudimentary
    legislation, regulations, and policy directives, in Ontario that did authorize
    administrative segregation, did not compel the civil servants to operate
    administrative segregation in ways that breached sections 7 and 12 of the </span>Charter</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. Thus, </span>Mackin</em><em><span style='font-style:

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge is correct in indicating that there is no statutory provision
    mandating administrative segregation in Ontario jails. There is no statute that
    directs correctional authorities to use administrative segregation or directs
    correctional authorities as to how administrative segregation is to be used in
    controlling the prisoner population.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></em>We also accept that, in cases in which there is a direct
    cause and effect between the statutory provision and the unconstitutional
    conduct, good governance concerns operate at their strongest: see e.g. <em>Mackin</em>.
    In <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>, and other cases, this court has accepted the
    relevance of good governance arguments when unconstitutional state conduct is
    traced to a regulatory scheme that is part statute, part regulation, and part policy.
    The respondent submits the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <em>CSF</em><em><span

    identified in </span></em><em>Ward</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> apply only to actions taken to enforce a statutory provision.</span></em></p>

    was factually complex, to put it mildly. The trial judge found several </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span

    government to adequately fund the transportation needs of CSF. The trial judge
    awarded </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> damages for that breach. The British Columbia Court of Appeal reversed, holding

    for a seven-person majority, restored the trial judge’s award. The Chief
    Justice drew a distinction between actions or decisions made under laws that
    were duly enacted, but subsequently declared to be invalid, and actions taken
    pursuant to the government’s own policies. He explained, at para. 177, that only
    actions taken under duly enacted legislation could be shielded from </span></em><em>Charter</em><em><span

  <p class=CQuote><em><span style='font-style:normal'>The enactment of laws is
    the fundamental role of legislatures, and the courts must not act so as to have
    a chilling effect on the legislatures’ actions in this regard. When the
    legislative branch enacts a law, it confers powers on the executive branch. In
    contrast, a minister’s decisions respecting school transportation are not a
    “source” of duty for the government in the same way as a law. When the
    executive branch adopts a government policy, it confers powers on itself. In
    light of this distinction, there is good reason not to extend the limited
    government immunity to government policies.</span></em></p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two-person dissent took issue with the distinction made between laws and
    government policies. The dissent saw good governance concerns as relevant to
    state action intended to carry out the functions of government. Those functions
    could be carried out by way of statutory enactments, but also by way of government
    policies. The minority opined, at para. 294:</p>
  <p class=CQuote> Again, the focus should not be on the <em>vehicle</em> of
    state action but rather the <em>purpose</em> of the immunity. Whether the state
    acts through legislation, regulations, or policies, the rationale behind the
    immunity is that the state should be able to carry out its functions without
    the threat of damages, absent some threshold of misconduct. Policymaking is
    clearly a key state function. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chief Justice’s reasons in <em>CSF</em>, distinguishing between actions in
    furtherance of a statutory authority and government policies, make the argument
    advanced by the respondent and accepted by the motion judge more formidable. It
    is difficult, however, to know, based on <em>CSF</em>, where the line is drawn
    between state action taken in furtherance of policies and state action made or
    taken under laws. In <em>CSF</em>, at para. 169, the Chief Justice quoted, with
    approval, from <em>Ward</em>, at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he state must be afforded some immunity from liability in
    damages resulting from the conduct of certain functions that only the state can
    perform. <span class=Underline>Legislative and policy-making functions are one
    such area of state activity. The immunity is justified because the law does not
    wish to chill the exercise of policy-making discretion</span>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <em>CSF</em>,
    at para. 169, the Chief Justice explained that the references to
    “policy-making” in <em>Ward</em> referred to “government policies that are
    based on laws”. <em>CSF</em> contemplates that some action based on government
    policies can raise good governance concerns.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would think that most government policies are based on laws in some way or
    another. The connection between a duly enacted law and a policy may be much
    more tenuous in some circumstances than others. Certainly, the link between
    Ontario’s administrative segregation regime and any statutory authority is
    tenuous. It may be, as the link between government action and duly enacted
    legislation becomes more tenuous or indirect, the level of blameworthiness of
    the state conduct needed to negate good governance concerns will decrease.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some cases, the evidence may go so far as to show no meaningful connection
    between any statutory authority and the governmental policies giving rise to
    the unconstitutional actions. In that case, it cannot be said that any state
    actor relied on a statutory authority to do anything. The good governance
    concerns described in <em>Ward</em> are predicated on an assumed reliance on
    some statutory authority as the justification for the impugned state conduct.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be that the majority in <em>CSF</em> intended to limit good governance
    concerns to cases like <em>Mackin</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>,
    where the unconstitutional conduct is compelled by the terms of the statute</span></em>.
    The majority does not, however, say so, and its approving reference to passages
    from <em>Ward</em>, which specifically include government policies, suggests
    otherwise. Nor does the analysis of the majority in <em>Henry</em>, a case
    where the unconstitutional conduct flowed from prosecutorial misconduct,
    support limiting good governance concerns to cases like <em>Mackin</em>. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the law in Ontario remains as set down in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em><em><span
style='font-style:normal'>. Good governance concerns</span></em> at step three
    of <em>Ward</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'> may be raised</span></em> if government policies, which precipitated unconstitutional actions, can be
    sufficiently connected to statutory provisions (or perhaps provisions in a
    regulation): see <em>CSF</em>, at para. 178.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    it is unnecessary to attempt a definitive interpretation of <em>CSF</em> for

    it is not technically necessary to consider the negligence claim in light of
    our conclusions regarding the <em>Charter</em> claim, we do so for the sake of
    completeness, recognizing that the matter was analyzed in detail by the motion
    judge and was fully argued before us. We are also conscious of the fact that
    another court might reach a different conclusion on the <em>Charter</em> issues
    and would then need to address the claim in negligence. It may also transpire
    that another court would take a different view of whether the damages award for <em>Charter</em> breaches should or should not subsume the damages award for

  <p class=Heading>C. Did the motion judge err in holding Ontario liable in
    negligence?</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    submits that the motion judge erred in finding that a duty of care arose out of
    Ontario’s statutory duties and in finding that the respondent’s claim was not
    extinguished or precluded by the <em>CLPA</em> or the <em>PACA</em> respectively.</p>
  <p class=MsoHeading8>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foundation for the negligence claim</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge undertook a lengthy review of the arguments surrounding whether a
    systemic negligence claim could be made out against Ontario on the facts of
    this case. He ultimately concluded that it could. The motion judge found that a
    duty of care arose from Ontario’s statutory duties and its relationship with
    the inmates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario
    challenges that conclusion largely on the basis that this court had already
    determined in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> that a systemic negligence claim could
    not be established. We note that <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> dealt with the
    federal correctional system, not the provincial correctional system. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that this court’s decision in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> has
    predetermined the outcome in this case. The decision in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> turned principally on the way in which the plaintiff had pleaded his case. In
    particular, this court found that the plaintiff had rested his systemic
    negligence claim on a pleading that challenged what this court found to be
    policy decisions. Since policy decisions are immune from suit, the negligence claim
    in that case had to fail. This court said, at para. 120:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The primary negligence claim in the amended statement of claim
    is negligence at the policy-making level. Negligence at the operational level
    is alleged as an alternative and that would turn on individual circumstances.
    Negligence at the policy level leads directly to the <em>Edwards</em>, <em>Cooper</em>,
    and <em>Eliopoulos</em> exclusion of a duty of care for matters of policy.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pleadings in this case are different from the ones in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em>.
    That difference arises in two respects. The first involves the class definition
    in this case. The class comprises two groups, as we have set out above – SMI Inmates
    who were subjected to administrative segregation for any length of time and Prolonged
    Inmates who were subjected to administrative segregation for periods of 15 or
    more consecutive days. The class does not include all the other inmates who may
    have been subject to administrative segregation in different circumstances or
    for different reasons.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second difference
    is that the amended statement of claim in this case focuses on the
    implementation of administrative segregation in Ontario institutions. It relies
    on decisions and actions that are of an operational nature. Indeed, the amended
    statement of claim makes frequent reference to Ontario’s responsibility for the
    “operation” of its correctional facilities. Specific allegations are made
    respecting negligence in operational decisions including:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failing to remove class members from administrative segregation

  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpMiddle><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failing to adequately, properly, and effectively, supervise the
    conduct of its employees, representatives, and agents to ensure that the class
    members would not suffer unreasonable harm; and</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failing to properly exercise discretion in determining an
    appropriate length of time for class members to spend in administrative segregation.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on these, and
    other, allegations of negligence, and in reliance on the evidence before him,
    the motion judge concluded, at para. 449:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>In the immediate case, Ontario was systemically and routinely
    negligent in the operation of administrative segregation in violation of
    Ontario’s own policies and practices.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have said, the
    motion judge engaged in a lengthy analysis of whether a duty of care arose in
    this case. We generally agree with that analysis. On the first branch of the test
    from <em>Cooper v. Hobart</em>, 2001 SCC 79, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537, the <em>prima</em><i> <em>facie</em></i> duty test, there is clearly a close relationship between
    Ontario and the inmates (i.e. proximity) that would support a basis for finding
    a duty of care. It is well-established that governments owe a duty of care to
    individuals while they are in custody: <em>MacLean v. The Queen</em><i>, </i>[1973]
    S.C.R. 2, at p. 7. Ontario does not dispute that is the case.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It follows, from the
    nature of the relationship, that actions taken which result in injury to an
    inmate could be reasonably foreseeable. Again, that is accepted to be the case
    on an individual basis, and we see no principled reason why that could not be
    the case on a class basis. If identical action is taken regarding the inmate
    population, or a subset of that population, and harm results, it is as
    foreseeable on a group-wide basis as it is on an individual basis.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That then leads to the
    second branch of the <em>Cooper v. Hobart</em> test, which is whether there are
    residual policy considerations that would militate against a finding of a duty
    of care. Those considerations lead to the issue of policy versus operational matters,
    about which we will have more to say when we come to the next issue, that is, the
    application of the <em>CLPA</em>. At the risk of foretelling our conclusion on
    that issue, we will say that we view the actions taken in this case, that form
    the basis of the negligence claim, to be tied to operational as opposed to
    policy matters.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As earlier noted, this
    court ruled against a systemic negligence claim in <em>Brazeau/Reddock</em> because
    it found, at para. 120: “Rather, the duty alleged arises from different acts in
    different circumstances and in relation to different individuals.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As we have mentioned
    above, the actions alleged in this case do not constitute different acts in
    different circumstances. Rather, what is challenged, at the very core of this
    claim, is the same act being undertaken, that is, placing inmates in
    administrative segregation in two specific circumstances where it is said that injury
    will naturally result. The first circumstance is where SMI Inmates are placed
    in administrative segregation for any length of time. The second circumstance
    is where Prolonged Inmates are placed in administrative segregation for a
    period of 15 or more consecutive days. The expert evidence establishes that both
    of these actions will give rise to injury or harm to each and every involved individual.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no reason in
    principle to adopt an approach to these claims that requires each individual
    inmate to commence their own action in order to seek relief for the resulting
    harm. Indeed, such a result would run counter to the very purpose behind the <em>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</em>, S.O. 1992, c. 6.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such a result would
    also be contrary to the approach taken in other similar types of claims. The
    motion judge refers to two such examples. In <em>Rumley v. British Columbia</em>,
    2001 SCC 69, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 184, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld a class
    action which alleged systemic negligence in the operation of a residential
    school for the deaf and blind. Similarly, in <em>Cloud v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</em><i> </i>(2004), 73 O.R. (3d) 401 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused,
    [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 50, this court certified a class action involving a claim
    of systemic negligence in the operation of a residential school.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In both of those
    cases, the same obstacle was sought to be erected to allowing a class claim,
    that is, that the individual circumstances would have to be examined in order
    to determine whether the duty of care had been breached. In both cases, that effort
    failed. As McLachlin C.J.C. said in <em>Rumley</em>, at para. 30:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The respondents assert, for example, that JHS did not have
    policies in place to deal with abuse, and that JHS acted negligently by placing
    all residential students in one dormitory in 1978. These are actions (or
    omissions) whose reasonability can be determined without reference to the
    circumstances of any individual class member.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in this
    case, the actions of Superintendents directing, or allowing, the SMI Inmates
    and the Prolonged Inmates to be subjected to administrative segregation can be
    determined without reference to their individual circumstances. In other words,
    those actions are capable of being determined on an institution-wide basis
    through the institution’s own records. The institution's records will establish
    which inmates were subjected to administrative segregation and, of those
    individuals, who falls within either the SMI Inmates or Prolonged Inmates
    groups. We repeat that the expert evidence then establishes that harm will be
    occasioned to each and every individual in both of those groups. While
    individual circumstances may ultimately be relevant to the proof of individual
    levels of damages, they are not required for proof of a breach of the duty of
    care on a system-wide basis, nor are they required for determining a base level
    of damages applicable to all: <em>Good v. Toronto (Police Services Board)</em>,

    They read:</p>

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge
    considered the application of the <em>CLPA</em> and concluded that it did not
    preclude the respondent’s claim for systemic negligence. In reaching that
    conclusion, the motion judge found that the <em>CLPA</em> simply codified the
    existing law regarding Crown immunity and the policy/operational dichotomy that
    rendered the Crown immune from liability for the former, but not the latter.
    The motion judge also found that Ontario’s conduct in this case was operational
    in nature, not a policy matter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario challenges the
    motion judge’s conclusion that the <em>CLPA</em> simply codifies the existing
    law on Crown immunity. Ontario says that, while a goal of the statute was to
    codify existing law, it was also a goal of the statute to “clarify” the
    existing law. In particular, Ontario argues that the statute intended to
    clarify what constitutes a policy matter as opposed to an operational matter.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of its
    submissions on the proper interpretation, Ontario points to one case that has
    since been decided under the <em>CLPA</em>, namely, <em>Seelster Farms v. Her
    Majesty the Queen and OLG</em>, 2020 ONSC 4013, 68 C.C.L.T. (4th) 104, where
    Emery J. said, at para. 117:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The <em>CLPA</em> removes the distinction between decisions
    that are policy decisions, and decisions that are operational in nature, made
    for the purpose of implementing or carrying out a government policy or program.
    The language used in [subsection 11(5)(c)] extends the traditional immunity
    afforded to policy decisions to those decisions made to implement a policy
    matter to decisions that include the termination of that policy, and any notice
    or other relief claimed by affected parties. The lines of analysis have been
    moved by the <em>CLPA</em> for the purpose of determining Crown immunity from
    questioning whether the decision was one of policy or if it was operational in
    nature, to whether it was made in good faith.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, the
    above language does not clarify the policy/operational dichotomy; it eliminates
    it.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent says
    that the decision in <em>Seelster Farms</em> stands alone in its interpretation
    of the <em>CLPA</em>. The intervener, Canadian Civil Liberties Association,
    agrees. It points to three other cases – <em>Barker v. Barker</em>, 2020 ONSC
    3746, at paras. 1262-1263; <em>Cirillo v. Ontario</em>, 2020 ONSC 3983, at para.
    13; and <em>Leroux v. Ontario</em>, 2020 ONSC 1994, 63 C.C.L.T. (4th) 219, at
    para. 29 – in which the opposite conclusion was reached or, at least, intimated.
    As will become apparent, we do not share the view expressed in <em>Seelster</em><i> <em>Farms</em></i> as to the effect of the legislation, although we understand
    how that view could arise on the face of the wording used in s. 11. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent buttresses
    his position as to the intention of the legislation by pointing to the
    explanation given by the Attorney General at the time that the legislation was
    introduced. The Attorney General told the Legislature, in part, that: “In this
    case what the legislation does is it codifies existing case law set by the
    Supreme Court that states that good faith policy decisions by governments are
    not judiciable in this case.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario responds by
    saying that the comments made by the Attorney General must be read in their
    entire context and repeats the fact that the Attorney General also explained
    that the legislation was intended to “clarify” the current state of the law.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We approach our
    analysis of this issue with two specific principles of statutory interpretation
    in mind. They are:</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpFirst><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in
    their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act,
    the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament: <em>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo
    Shoes Ltd. (Re)</em><i>, </i>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=MsoListBulletCxSpLast><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a presumption that the common law remains unchanged
    absent a clear and unequivocal expression of legislative intent: <em>Canada (Attorney
    General) v. Thouin</em><i>, </i>2017 SCC 46, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 184, at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In considering the
    proper interpretation of the statute, we are also mindful of the genesis of
    statutes that address the issue of Crown immunity from suit. That genesis was explained
    in <em>Just v. British Columbia</em>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1228, where Cory J. said,
    at p. 1239:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The early governmental immunity from tortious liability became
    intolerable. This led to the enactment of legislation which in general imposed
    liability on the Crown for its acts as though it were a person. However, the
    Crown is not a person and must be free to govern and make true policy decisions
    without becoming subject to tort liability as a result of those decisions. On
    the other hand, complete Crown immunity should not be restored by having every
    government decision designated as one of &quot;policy&quot;.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, Ontario’s
    submission as to the proper interpretation of the <em>CLPA</em> comes
    perilously close to adopting precisely what Cory J. cautioned against, that is,
    characterizing every government decision as policy. This results from the interpretation
    that Ontario asks be given to s. 11, and, more particularly, to these words
    from s. 11(5)(c): “the manner in which a program, project or other initiative
    is carried out”. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario’s
    interpretation would give those words almost limitless application which would,
    in turn, dramatically change the current state of the law. Indeed, Ontario accepts
    that, at common law, decisions as to how government programs are to be “carried
    out” might well have been characterized as “operational” decisions to which no
    immunity applies. However, Ontario submits that the intent of s. 11(5)(c) is to
    reverse that situation. That result would give a rather expansive meaning to
    the word “clarify”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario then attempts
    to limit the consequences of this submission by saying that it does not seek to
    immunize all government action from negligence claims “as many government acts
    and omissions do not fall within its ambit”. Ontario does not, though, explain how
    its submission as to the proper interpretation of the statute would allow for
    that result.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is s. 11(5)(c) of
    the <em>CLPA</em> that is at the heart of the interpretive issue. We would not
    give it the broad interpretation that Ontario urges in this case. We reach that
    conclusion for a number of reasons. First and foremost is the principle, that we
    set out above, that there is a presumption that the common law remains
    unchanged absent a clear and unequivocal expression of legislative intent. In our
    view, the combination of ss. 11(4) and (5) fails to achieve that clear and
    unequivocal expression. Sub-section 11(4) expressly references matters of
    policy. Sub-section 11(5) then purports to define what a policy matter may include.
    It follows that this definition must be predicated on maintaining the
    policy/operational separation. Had the intention been to do otherwise, the
    legislation could have expressly said so. For example, s. 11(5)(c) could have
    opened with “…the manner in which a program, project or other initiative is
    carried out, <u>including operational decisions regarding</u>,…” if the intent
    had been to expand the policy label to the extent that Ontario now submits.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, to adopt
    Ontario’s expansive meaning of s. 11(5)(c) of the <em>CLPA</em> would directly
    offend the purpose behind statutes limiting Crown immunity, as explained by
    Cory J. in <em>Just</em>. There is, in fact, no limitation to the effect of the
    expansive meaning urged by Ontario in this case. Its logical conclusion would
    include virtually any step taken by the provincial government in carrying out any
    “program, project or other initiative”. Indeed, this is precisely the conclusion
    reached in <em>Seelster</em><i> <em>Farms</em></i>. The difficulty with that
    approach is aptly expressed by McLachlin C.J.C. in <em>R. v. Imperial Tobacco
    Canada Ltd.</em><i>, </i>2011 SCC 42, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 45, at para. 76: “[e]xempting
    all government actions from liability would result in intolerable outcomes.”</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, to adopt
    Ontario’s expansive meaning would require a conclusion either that the Attorney
    General, at the time, did not understand the effect of the legislation being
    introduced, or that she misled the Legislature as to its intention and effect.
    Neither of those conclusions should be drawn absent there being no alternative
    explanation. In contrast, an interpretation of the <em>CLPA</em> that maintains
    the existing separation between policy decisions and operational decisions takes
    the Attorney General at her word.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying that approach
    to this case, we accept that the provincial government can adopt a policy of
    using administrative segregation in its correctional facilities. That is a
    policy matter, and its advisability is a matter for the government alone to
    determine, albeit within limits. We also consider it to be a policy matter for
    the government to decide who will implement administrative segregation, in the
    sense that it is open to the government to delegate the details and manner of
    implementation of the policy to the Superintendents of the various correctional
    facilities, as opposed to having those details determined, for example, by the
    relevant Ministry officials. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, how the
    policy is actually applied, that is, its process at ground level, is not a policy
    matter. That is an operational matter, like any number of other operational
    matters that the Superintendent of a correctional institution has to determine
    on a day-to-day basis. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This line between
    policy and operational matters may be illustrated by adapting an example used
    by counsel for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. If the provincial
    government decides that it wishes to provide public transit between two towns
    in Ontario, that is a policy decision. If the provincial government decides that
    it is going to provide that public transit through buses rather than trains,
    that is also a policy decision. However, how those buses actually transport
    people is an operational matter. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[133]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is, in
    our view, consistent with the prevailing authorities on the distinction between
    policy and operation – admittedly a distinction that courts have found
    “notoriously difficult to decide”: <em>Imperial Tobacco</em>,<i> </i>at para. 78.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[134]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A review of the case
    law demonstrates that government immunity from tort claims relates only to what
    is referred to as “true” or “core” policy decisions. The rationale for this
    immunity was to allow governments ample scope to make decisions based upon
    social, political and economic factors, without being exposed to tort liability
    for those decisions. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In discussing this
    point in his reasons in <em>Just</em>, at pp. 1241-42, Cory J. references the
    decision of the High Court of Australia in <em>Sutherland Shire Council v.
    Heyman</em>, [1985] HCA 41, 157 C.L.R. 424, at paras. 38-39, <em>per</em><i> </i>Mason
    J., which also discussed the policy/operation distinction. In that decision, it
    was noted that budgetary allocations and constraints cannot be the subject of a
    tort claim. However, the court noted that it would be different when a court is
    called upon to review “action or inaction that is merely the product of
    administrative direction”.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision in <em>Just</em> went on to consider other situations, including the inspections of lighthouses or
    aircraft manufacturing, and the difference between decisions regarding the
    funding of such inspections (policy) and the conduct of those inspections
    (operation). In applying these principles to the facts of the case before him,
    which was the inspection of a rock slope beside a highway, Cory J. found that
    the inspections were “manifestations of the implementation of the policy
    decision to inspect and were operational in nature”: at p. 1246. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The policy/operation
    distinction was also discussed in <em>Imperial</em><i> <em>Tobacco</em></i>. In
    explaining the distinction, McLachlin C.J.C. again focussed on whether the
    decision in question was the result of “social, economic, and political”
    considerations: at para. 87. McLachlin C.J.C. concluded on the issue of policy
    as follows, at para. 90:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>I conclude that &quot;core policy&quot; government decisions
    protected from suit are decisions as to a course or principle of action that
    are based on public policy considerations, such as economic, social and
    political factors, provided they are neither irrational nor taken in bad faith.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McLachlin C.J.C. also repeated
    the observation, from U.S. case law, that “employees working at the operational
    level are not usually involved in making policy choices”: at para. 89.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view,
    Superintendents (or their staff) are such employees. Regulation 778 reflects a
    policy of permitting administrative segregation. However, in deciding to place class
    members in administrative segregation, Superintendents were implementing that
    policy and, thus, their decisions were operational in nature. In doing so, we
    would note, their decisions did not revolve around social, economic or
    political considerations.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, s.
    11(5)(c) of the <em>CLPA</em> does not protect Ontario from the actual results
    that flow from the implementation of its administrative segregation policy. On
    that point, we note that Regulation 778 does not contain any definition of what
    constitutes segregation, nor does it impose any caps on the length of such
    segregation or stipulate the manner in which segregation is to be affected, nor
    does it cover a myriad of other matters regarding how segregation will actually
    be employed. All of these details are left for the individual Superintendent to
    determine. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If a Superintendent
    applies the policy on administrative segregation to an inmate in a negligent
    manner, that is, in a manner that causes injury or harm, then Ontario is liable
    for that injury or harm. This negligence could include applying segregation in
    a manner that constitutes solitary confinement; applying segregation to
    seriously mentally ill inmates; imposing segregation for periods of 15 days or
    more on any inmate; and other like decisions that run contrary to established
    medical evidence as to the consequences. Such a result is beyond the reach of any
    expanded definition of policy contained in s. 11(5)(c) of the <em>CLPA</em> as we

  <p class=AParaNumbering>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One last technical
    point needs to be addressed with respect to this issue. Ontario asserts that
    the respondent’s claim is fundamentally flawed because it does not advance
    specific allegations of tortious conduct by individual Crown servants, for whom
    Ontario would be vicariously liable. Rather, Ontario says that the claim
    advanced is effectively one of direct liability from which Ontario is immune
    under s. 5 of the <em>PACA</em><i>.</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a> Ontario is only liable for indirect claims, under s. 5(1), which reads, in
    part:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>[T]he Crown is subject to all liabilities in tort to which, if
    it were a person of full age and capacity, it would be subject,</p>
  <p class=CQuote>(a) in respect of a tort committed by any of its servants or
    agents;</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge addressed
    this argument in his reasons and rejected it. He said, at para. 485:</p>
  <p class=CQuote>The discussion above shows that the case at bar is about the
    operational decisions of Ontario's civil servants not about core policy
    decisions, which is another way of saying that the case at bar is not a direct
    negligence claim precluded by Crown immunity. The discussion above about
    systemic negligence reveals that it is not necessary to name the individual
    civil servants whose collective conduct led to a system-wide breach of the duty
    of care and system-wide harm to the collective of inmates.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
    motion judge’s determination of this issue. On a fair reading of the amended
    statement of claim, it is clear that the allegations being made against Ontario
    arise from its vicarious liability for the negligent acts of its servants. The
    amended statement of claim expressly references Regulation 778, by which
    administrative segregation decisions are left to the individual
    Superintendents. It is also clear from the amended statement of claim that the
    negligent acts are those of servants of Ontario. It is axiomatic to point out
    that Ontario can only operate through the actions of individuals.</p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no absolute
    requirement that the individual servants of the Crown, who undertake the
    negligent acts, must be named in the proceeding. Section 5(2) of the <em>PACA</em> simply says that no proceeding can be brought against the Crown “unless a
    proceeding in tort in respect of such act or omission <u>may</u> be brought
    against that servant or agent” (emphasis added). The section does not require
    that the proceeding <u>must</u> be brought against that servant or agent. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept that best
    practices in pleadings might suggest that the negligent individual, from whom
    vicarious liability arises, be named as a party, at least in a case where only
    one event or individual is involved. However, this is a class proceeding in
    which collective claims are made. As the motion judge pointed out, it is
    impractical to expect a representative plaintiff, advancing a claim covering a
    class period of almost three and one-half years, with class members in 32
    correctional institutions, to name all of the individuals involved in the
    collectively negligent acts. </p>
  <p class=AParaNumbering>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As an alternative,
    best practices in pleadings might suggest naming a John and Jane Doe to
    represent all of those individuals in such situations, but the failure to do so
    is not fatal to the claim. On this point, we repeat the often-cited principle
    that a statement of claim is to be read “as generously as possible and to
    accommodate any inadequacies in the form of the allegations which are merely
    the result of drafting deficiencies<em>”: Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen</em>,
    [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441, at p. 451.</p>
